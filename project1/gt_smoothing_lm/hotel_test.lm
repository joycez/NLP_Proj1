<s> Me and my husband stayed in the Allegro Hotel Chicago for 4 days 3 nights recently . </s> <s> We got a room with a king size bed . . </s> <s> Although the room is small ; we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages ' all . </s> <s> However ; we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable ; the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us . </s> <s> The walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound . </s> <s> 1 of the days ; our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels ; rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign . </s> <s> The worst is upon returning to the hotel at night ; we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage . </s> <s> The housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins . </s> <s> This is unacceptable to us . </s> <s> The hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night . </s> <s> Although it is near the CTA trains ; i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view . </s> <s> Am staying again at a Kimpton hotel in San Fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change ! </s> <s> Overall ; not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to Chicago again !

<s> After staying at the James Chicago last weekend I can honestly say I will be going for affordability on my next trip . </s> <s> The James Chicago is terribly overpriced and the staff was very cold and disconnected . </s> <s> The chairs in the room looked like something out of Ikea . </s> <s> I love Chicago but this hotel is definitely not one of its better places to stay . </s> <s> I believe I would have been better off and happier staying at the Holiday Inn . </s> <s> You don 't always get what you pay for .

<s> My company booked our group for a Conference and Sales Meeting . </s> <s> The service was friendly ; helpful and the property was beautiful . </s> <s> The hotel was clean and filled with history . </s> <s> We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the rate was reasonable as well . ' </s>

<s> The Chicago Palmer House disappointed me . </s> <s> I chose it because it a Hilton hotel ; but it definitely does not live up to the standard set by this name . </s> <s> My first impression was a negative one when I was greeted by a rather rude staff . </s> <s> My room might have been luxurious years ago ; but the general impression was that it had not been cleaned regularly and could use a little freshening . </s> <s> The bathroom was obviously newer but the shower was difficult to use and the water pressure was absolutely horrible . </s> <s> The food served by the room service and at the hotel 's restaurant sounded delicious on the carefully crafted menus ; and the high prices made me expect delicate cuisine . </s> <s> The food simply did not deliver its promises . </s> <s> Everything tasted very bland and the portions were ridiculously small . </s> <s> The location of the hotel might seem like an advantage ; since it is in downtown Chicago nearby many touristic attractions : however ; the windows in my room did not protect me from the constant noise of cars going by . </s> <s> Overall ; this hotel would be decent if it did not advertise itself as a luxury hotel and did not use the Hilton name and price range .

<s> I was really excited when we booked a night at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago . </s> <s> It was actually beyond our budget ; but my husband and I needed a weekend away ; so I decided to splurge for the occasion . </s> <s> WORST WASTE OF MY MONEY EVER ! ! ! </s> <s> Our room was smaller than pictured online ; and it looked like the maid didn 't vacuum the carpet ! </s> <s> We visited the hotel restaurant ; Angels and Kings ; one night for dinner and the drinks were overpriced and my husband 's steak was cooked wrong 'he ordered medium ; but received a well-done steak ' . </s> <s> By the end of our trip we were so glad to leave ; but they were under-staffed and the Sunday morning checkout line was so long that we waited in line for 30 minutes until we could check out . </s> <s> Chicago was a fun city ; but next time we return I 'll be choosing a different hotel - and I suggest you do too ! !

<s> Located right in the heart of downtown Chicago i visited this hotel on a business trip . </s> <s> The first things i noticed was how friendly the staff is ; and how clean the rooms are 'even compared to other luxury hotels ' seeing as i had a night layover before my meeting i decided to stop by the Terrace and get a drink ; i got a mojito and i must say i was very impressed ; i 've had my share of mojitos and it was one of the better ones ; once i retired back to my room i found the sound system to be excellent ; bed was soft and the TV didn 't appear burned out at all . </s> <s> Overall i give this a five out of five ; the staff was helpful and friendly the whole time and the atmosphere was perfect ; i wish i could have stayed longer .

<s> If you are traveling to Chicago and need a place to stay ; I highly recommend the Hotel Allegro Chicago . </s> <s> It was visiting time visiting Chicago for the first time on a business trip and a friend referred me to the Hotel Allegro . </s> <s> He said they were pet friendly ; which was a huge plus . </s> <s> This is because I hate leaving my kitten muffin with a pet sitter every time I travel for business . </s> <s> Upon my arrival ; I was met with friendly valet who treated me like I was the only customer who mattered . </s> <s> I walked in and saw a hotel like no other I have seen before or after . </s> <s> The lobby was decorated with modern furniture and paintings and looked like a place I could relax in . </s> <s> After I had entered and checked in ; I saw the staircase ; which looked like a testament to the staircase in the " Titanic " . </s> <s> Frankly ; I was amazed and I had not even entered my room yet . </s> <s> My room was a Queen Deluxe room and it was amazing . </s> <s> The bed had a blue headboard ; which I have never seen before ; and the colors worked together so well I seriously contemplated living there . </s> <s> The room service was exceptional and promptly brought the food I ordered . </s> <s> Later I wanted to get a drink and I enjoyed it at The Bar 312 ; which is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel . </s> <s> These are the specifics of my stay ; but there is much more to be experienced that I did not mention if you visit the Hotel Allegro . </s> <s> In summary ; they allow pets ; the service is amazing ; the decoration superb ; and it is conveniently situated next to dining establishments . </s> <s> What more could a person ask for ?

<s> Downtown Chicago has a multitude of available hotels . </s> <s> However once youve decided to step away from the ordinary a fantastic way to get away from it all is by booking a stay at the Homewood suites . </s> <s> The combination of luxury and affordability is evident as soon as youve entered the glamourous lobby . </s> <s> The Downtown Homewood suites is located near all the attractions which make Chicago the diverse and culturally rich town that is world known . </s> <s> The hotel offers a free fitness center ; high speed wireless internet as well as a complimentary buffet breakfast . </s> <s> Being a member of the Hilton family ensures the utmost in quality and service which has been observed by millions of customers around the world .

<s> The concierge was so helpful . </s> <s> Without hesitation they had the best recommendations for restaurants and attractions all turning out to be wonderful . </s> <s> They even gave us business cards for restaurants that did not take reservations so we could obtain preferential or immediate seating 's . </s> <s> Loved the health club at the back of the hotel . </s> <s> By joining the presidents club ; it only cost ten dollars a day to use the facilities . </s> <s> The rooms were large ; updated and had views looking out in 3 directions . </s> <s> The coffee maker in the room was exceptional . </s> <s> Location is great for getting mostly anywhere . </s> <s> Parking is overpriced so we took our cart to the underground Millennium Garage that was only $25 . 00 per 24 hours and a few blocks walk from the hotel .

<s> Our visit started off on the wrong foot when we entered the lobby struggling to carry all of our luggage and ; instead of helping ; a group of hotel employees stood watching and laughing at us . </s> <s> They had trouble locating our reservation . </s> <s> Our room was tiny ! </s> <s> When I 'm paying over $400 a night for a room ; I expect to be able to walk around in it ! </s> <s> The beds were also tiny . </s> <s> The walls were thin and we could hear our neighbors talking next door . </s> <s> This hotel was probably once beautiful and classy ; but now it seems to be outdated and due for repairs . </s> <s> Won 't be staying here again .

<s> My stay at the Talbott was a wonderful experience . </s> <s> The service at this upscale hotel was beyond my expectations ; the Gold Coast location is close to Michigan Ave ; the museums ; and many of the other sites Chicago has to offer .

<s> I am usually a big fan of Kimpton Hotels ; but this place is awful ! ! ! </s> <s> I would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left . </s> <s> It is an old ; dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more " botique " . </s> <s> The carpets are dirty ; and tattered ; patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet . </s> <s> yuck ! ! ! </s> <s> The bathrooms are tiny ; and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them . </s> <s> When we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned ; we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way . </s> <s> We woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table . </s> <s> We told the front desk ; called housekeeping ; and then called the front desk again . . finally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum . </s> <s> The elevators are slow ; and often only one is working at any given time . </s> <s> I did not find the staff to be friendly at all ; except for one waiter ' breakfast . </s> <s> What a disappointment : ' '
<s> This is one of my favorite Sheratons 'Starwood properties . </s> <s> I have stayed at a lot of hotels 'mostly Starwood ' in Chi but all around ; this is my favorite based on cost ; amenities and downtown location . </s> <s> I really like it beginning with unloading the taxi because I am greeted by Nick who has been there for years . </s> <s> He gives the best greeting from LA to NY and is always happy ! </s> <s> He obviously loves his job . </s> <s> People at the front desk are always nice and efficient . </s> <s> If you like to workout ; Roberta runs their fitness center . </s> <s> Another one who loves their job and serves guests well . </s> <s> Great lake ' river view while working out . </s> <s> On this particular trip I was caught in a pinch ; however ; Christy the former mgr was able to take care of a frequent guest . </s> <s> I considered it a " minor miracle " based on hotel availability . </s> <s> The maids on 29th floor were very friendly and efficient . </s> <s> Another great experience .

<s> Talbot Hotel- Came out to Chicago for my buddie 's bachelor party . </s> <s> We are from the midwest and we thought this was intuitive ; so we decided to stay at the Talbot . </s> <s> We had a great time : it was rowdy of course ; but it was pleasant to stay in such a central area close to all the clubs . </s> <s> In the heart of the Gold Coast ; we were right where you want to be when it comes to nightlife . </s> <s> But the rooms themselves were extremely well set up . </s> <s> The suite was the way to go : we had 42 inch TV ; newspaper delivery ; and high-speed wireless which helped us form our gameplan for exploring our new area . </s> <s> The sofas were essential too ; and very conducive to having multiple people in one room together . </s> <s> Overall ; this hotel was ideal : spacious with all the amenities you would ever need ; but also close to any place we would ever want to go .

<s> Allegro - I stayed in Allegro Hotel 's King Suite in December when I visited Chicago for a company event . </s> <s> I have to say that my stay was absolutely pathetic . </s> <s> Even though I had booked the room earlier ; it seemed that they had not arranged for it . </s> <s> I had to wait for more than an hour at the reception even though I turned up late in the afternoon . </s> <s> The staff did not even seem to be bothered and their apology seemed superficial . </s> <s> Also ; when I used the bathroom in the morning ; the Jacuzzi was not working which is something that I hated because I did not have enough time to request for a room change . </s> <s> Only the food which I ordered through room service was good . </s> <s> Otherwise ; I would never recommend this hotel to anyone .

<s> Worst high priced hotel I 've ever stayed at ! </s> <s> I had a business meeting in Chicago and heard good reviews from a few co-workers thought it would be a nice place to stay but was a little upset with my experience with Swissotel in Chicago . Front desk clerk was very rude at check in ; valet parking was great until they brought my SUV around front with a quarter size dent in the passenger size door ; the hotel refused to pay for the damages . </s> <s> The room was very beautiful besides the faint mildew smell in the room . </s> <s> Room service was great and very pleasing ! Our business meeting took place in the St Gallen room where our meeting took a little disruptive turn ; there was construction going on during that time and was very hard to hear the announcer in our meeting . </s> <s> Other than that the hotel was beautiful but the stay wasn 't as great as i expected ; you may want to book somewhere else if you have a business meeting to attend in Chicago .

<s> While this is a good location for shopping and sightseeing ; I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . </s> <s> The rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny ; all of which is to be expected in an old urban hotel ; but apparently care has not been given to updating the hotel 'ever !

<s> The Hard Rock Hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into Chicago . . </s> <s> The location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as Lake Michigan ; Millennium Park ; and Art Museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from . </s> <s> My co-works LOVED the exterior of the building ; views from the rooms ; the art on the walls ; and crisp ; clean ' hip feeling of the hotel ; but not " too over the top " for " business " . </s> <s> By far a better experience than your usual " chain " hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms . </s> <s> Here you feel special . . . for the same price . </s> <s> The lobby and bar have fun ' cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on Michigan Ave 'or catch a real rock star in the lobby !

<s> Swisses Chicago : Nice ; but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the Chicago waterfront . </s> <s> A spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city ; but don 't plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning . </s> <s> No free WiFi here ; or affordable breakfast ; or a free swim in the pool . </s> <s> Just a ten-dollar-a-night charge for internet ; an on average $25 plate for breakfast ; and another 15 bucks a night for the " fitness center . " </s> <s> I 've stayed in small town no star motels where WiFi is free as part of a 50 dollar room . </s> <s> Get with it - this is 2009 ! </s> <s> No free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and don 't need it anyway ; but for those of us who aren 't charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated . </s> <s> Coffee ; milk ; OJ ; stale donuts ; ; muffins ; maybe some cereal . </s> <s> Throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby . </s> <s> With regards to swimming ; this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan accordingly . </s> <s> This all makes the $6 Fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain . </s> <s> Summation : Drop the fees ; the nickel dimming of folks ; and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel .

<s> Sofitel - I had a rather mediocre experience at the Sofitel . </s> <s> I came for a sudden business meeting during the holiday season ; and the Sofitel was the only hotel for miles that was not booked to capacity . </s> <s> I had a very important proposal to submit to my boss the night I was staying there ; but the Wi-Fi was so slow that ; in the end ; I was not able to complete it in time . </s> <s> My complaint is that hotels as expensive as the Sofitel should at least have a decent Wi-Fi connection !

<s> The staff at the James Chicago hotel seemed determined to make my stay a horrible one . </s> <s> When I entered the establishment to check in ; I was ignored . </s> <s> The clerk let half a dozen people in front of me before she even acknowledged me . </s> <s> Thinking room service would be better ; I relaxed in my room while I waited for my food . </s> <s> By the time it reached my room ; it was cold AND the wrong order . </s> <s> Disgusted ; I went down to the pool only to find it was closed for maintenance . </s> <s> All the restaurants the hotel recommended were one-star ; and none of my regular channels were on the tv . </s> <s> All in all ; it was a bad stay at the James hotel in Chicago .

<s> Be prepared the hotel is old . </s> <s> It is on the historic list . </s> <s> The is updating to be done no doubt . . </s> <s> So just be forewarned . </s> <s> It is clean and the staff is phenomenal . </s> <s> Having said that ; you can not beat the location . </s> <s> Right in the heart of the Gold coast . </s> <s> Take a train from O 'hare right into the city . </s> <s> It drops you off only 4 blocks from the hotel . </s> <s> One block from the beach and public transportation is right there . </s> <s> Incredible area to explore . </s> <s> I highly recommend the Ambassador East '

<s> Hard Rock Chicago - I had gone to Chicago last week to meet some friends . </s> <s> As the purpose of my visit was leisure I had to pick a hotel that was close to Downtown and was suited to a young crowd . </s> <s> After some research ; Hard Rock seemed to meet both the criteria . </s> <s> I had made reservations two months in advance ; so got a decent rate of $259 a night 'If you book last minute it will definitely be expensive ' . </s> <s> The decor of the rooms and the hotel was in line with its theme . </s> <s> When I entered the room there was some towels that were thrown on the floor . </s> <s> This did upset me at first but the staff was very accommodating and gave me a new room immediately and also gave me a compensation of $70 . </s> <s> My second room and the bathroom was spacious and clean . </s> <s> There was well stocked mini bar . . . however was very expensive like all good hotels . </s> <s> The room service was very prompt . </s> <s> I didn ' ' 't spend too much time in the room ; but whatever little I did was all in all a good experience .

<s> Great front desk staff ; the rest of the experience was dreadful . </s> <s> The room service staff have to be among the most poorly trained I have ever encountered . </s> <s> We had to ask FOUR times for the staff not to slam the supply closet ; adjacent to our room 'almost in the room itself ' . </s> <s> They do these random room checks for the minibar ; as if the entire budget hinged on the sale of a can of $9 peanuts . </s> <s> The roomservice is also equipped with walkie-talkies as loud as megaphones . </s> <s> If you like sleeping in on your vacation ; don 't stay here . </s> <s> Also ; the hotel was under massive construction ; a detail that was conveniently excluded from the website . </s> <s> SO we had to take the elevator with construction workers just about every time we used it . </s> <s> No discount because of the work and noise . </s> <s> I 'd rather sleep in a box in the alley .

We then decided to exit via the stairs ; realizing too late that once you entered the stairwells ; doors behind you were locked . We continued to travel downward ; against the backdrop music of sirens and loud muffled speakers . Obviously ; we were rescued without any physical injuries ; yet emotionally we were damaged . I now choose my hotels in the range of ten floors or less . ' </s> 
<s> We stayed at the James hotel for a 40th birthday . </s> <s> The location was excellent for shopping and restaurants ; but also very loud . </s> <s> The room was horrible . </s> <s> VERY SMALL . </s> <s> We had a double 'double and it was the size of a college dorm room ; plus completely white walls and linens . </s> <s> Absolutely no color except for one accent pillow . </s> <s> It was very sterile and uninviting . </s> <s> We were on the 11th floor and the lobby for the elevator was dark and done in red and balck with minimal lighting . </s> <s> It looked like the entrance to hell ; if not a haunted house . </s> <s> Staff was very nice and accomodating . </s> <s> I would not return to this hotel .

<s> Conrad Chicago - While I have been impressed with other branches of this hotel ; this one is lacking in many areas . </s> <s> The front staff was somewhat incompetent . </s> <s> The rooms were tidy and cleaning was not up to the mark ; the TV was non operational ; shower arm was rusty and the breakfast service was slow . </s> <s> Given this is a 4 . 5 star hotel ; it really didn 't live up to the expectations . </s> <s> The only good part was that the hotel was in the middle of great sight seeing locations . </s> <s> Anyway ; Definitely would not recommend anyone staying here considering there are many other good hotels around this area .

<s> The Amalfi Hotel Chicago portrayed itself to be a luxurious comfortable place to stay . </s> <s> When arriving at the hotel my party and I had over a 20 minute wait just to check in . </s> <s> We were treated like cattle once we were able to check in at their " private " counter that their website highlights . </s> <s> It felt as though I was sitting with a bank teller rather than checking in . </s> <s> Not only did the wait and process take seemingly forever ; but our reservations were completely wrong . </s> <s> I ended up having to settle for a double non-smoking room when I had reserved a smoking king room . </s> <s> Not having the room I requested and was assured was available is completely unacceptable for the high prices of this supposedly high end luxurious hotel . </s> <s> I was not compensated for having to switch rooms and Audrey our Experience Designer was no help at all even when we called down upon entering the room which smelled of urine and stale booze . </s> <s> I recommend saving a handful of money and checking into a chain hotel in the area . </s> <s> The Amalfi Hotel Chicago is a waste of time and money as far as I am concerned especially when I could stay at a cheaper chain hotel and get better treatment and comfort . </s> <s> Don 't waist your time staying here .

<s> When you stay at a hotel like The James ; just from their price point ; you expect a certain level of quality . </s> <s> If I pay well over 500 dollars for a room ; I do not think it unreasonable to expect not only a quality room ; but also a certain level of standard of service . </s> <s> Perhaps this hotel should rename itself The Lebron James ; because it has about as much class as he does ; and is about twice as pretentious . </s> <s> A handful of baby powder thrown into my face would have been a refreshing break from the level of service I received at The Lebron James . </s> <s> My night of hell began with the clerk ; bellboy ; or whatever he was ; at the front desk ; who faked what I assume was intended to be a British accent ; but ended up as an unholy melding of Australian and New Englander . </s> <s> A British accent does not make you fancy ; or skilled . </s> <s> Once I made my way past Mr. Belvedere and to my room ; I was disappointed ; not only by its size ; which was unusually small ; but also a faint scent of cigarettes . </s> <s> Not a strong one ; but I could definitely smell smoke . </s> <s> Not acceptable . </s> <s> Then ; while I was sleeping ; a deep throbbing sound began to emanate from the walls . </s> <s> It sounded technical ; mechanical ; like an air conditiner malfunctioning . </s> <s> Despite many reassurances from the front desk ; the throbbing continued on throughout the night . </s> <s> I demanded the man at the front desk come up and rectify the situation immediately ; but from what I could tell ; he never came .

<s> Our trip to Chicago was a complete delight despite our stay at the Affinia Hotel . </s> <s> Because their rates were actually higher than we were used to in New York City ; we naturally assumed we would get a nicer establishment . </s> <s> We could not have been more wrong . </s> <s> This place focuses on gimmicks to set themselves apart from their competition . </s> <s> Uunfortunately ; it does set them apart but in a strictly negative way . </s> <s> Both the " Dream Pillow Menu " and the " Experience Kit " were a complete flop . </s> <s> With the " Dream Pillow Menu " ; the hotel offered patrons what seemed to be great pillow choices from down-stuffed to hypoallergenic selections . </s> <s> We happily chose the fluffy down pillows but when we got to our room and laid down on them a giant poof of dust came out . </s> <s> At first ; I thought it was my imagination so I stood up and hit the pillows on the edge of the bed . </s> <s> More dust came out them ! </s> <s> Particles were flying around the room ; I 'm now sneezing and there was this disgusting grit all over my sunglasses that were sitting on the night stand . </s> <s> I called the desk and they sent up replacements for all the pillows . </s> <s> These pillows were some kind of " music pillow " that pluged into an mp3 player . </s> <s> I was sleeping on uncomfortable cords all night . </s> <s> In general ; the staff was pleasant and tried to be accommodating ; but there was just no apology good enough for filthy pillows . </s> <s> Another failed gimmick they offered was the " Experience Kits " . </s> <s> We were given 'ours to keep ' a collection of some maps 'which were actually very nice ' ; a walking tour guide that was all marked up ; and a handy deck of cards opened and missing two cards . </s> <s> If this place lacked attention to detail ; that is one thing ; but it lacked any attention at all . </s> <s> If the pillows weren 't already enough ; at this point I was certain that I would never stay at this establishment again . </s> <s> Run ; don 't walk away from this place .

<s> My daughter wanted to spend the weekend in Chicago for her 21st birthday recently ; and I wanted to find the best hotel for her experience . </s> <s> I looked at the hotel website and really like Hotel Allegro 's insistence in supplying organic fare and in-room spa services ; so I booked us for a Friday and Saturday night . </s> <s> Upon arriving ; the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant . </s> <s> Not enough to warrant a verbal complaint ; but enough to make my daughter and I feel uneasy . </s> <s> After check-in ; which took at least 20 minutes due to severe under-staffing ; we headed to our room trying to be optimistic . </s> <s> Our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested ; the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound ; and we only had a stock of 2 towels ; which were never replaced during our stay . </s> <s> We made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel . </s> <s> It was a huge disappointment ; for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl . </s> <s> I highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel . </s> <s> There are much better choices in the Chicago area .

<s> I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel ; and it was one of the absolute worse travel experiences that I ever had . </s> <s> One of the main reasons why I had originally booked my stay at the Fairmont was because the property offered special ; " pure " rooms and suites that are supposed to be hypoallergenic . </s> <s> Because I suffer from extreme allergies -- and I really hate the thought of a less-than-pristine hotel room -- I was happy to pay extra for a room that was supposed to be specially designed for guests with environmental sensitivities . </s> <s> I 'll tell you this right now -- save your money . </s> <s> When I got to my room ; I immediately detected the distinct smells of cigarette smoke and mold . </s> <s> To add to the gross factor ; I took a look around and noticed dust on the lamps and light fixtures as well as dirt on the carpet . </s> <s> The comforter on the bed looked messy as well -- as if someone had recently used the bed and then hastily threw the comforter back over it . </s> <s> There was no way I was going to stay in this room ; so I made my way back to the check-in desk and politely informed them of the problems with my room . </s> <s> The woman at the front desk told me there were no other rooms available and it was only after we practically got into a yelling match that she grudgingly started typing away at her computer . </s> <s> After making me wait for another twenty minutes ; she finally informed me that they could put me in another room ; but it would be a four hour wait . </s> <s> Four hours ! </s> <s> It was absolutely ridiculous . </s> <s> No hotel -- much less one that constantly touts some sort of promise of superior customer service -- should ever treat any of its customers this way . </s> <s> I do not recommend the Fairmont nor will I ever stay there again . ' </s> 
<s> I recently stayed at the Swissotel Chicago with my husband and two children . </s> <s> While the room was comfortable ; I did not think that it was the best choice of hotel for those with children . </s> <s> The main reason for this was the dining . </s> <s> While the in house restaurants had children 's options ; there were not any other dining options that were a bit more informal . </s> <s> Anyone with children knows that you don 't want to take them to a sit down restaurant at certain times . </s> <s> This was especially true since we were traveling . </s> <s> We arrived at the hotel with tired children in hand and wanted to eat a quick meal and then put them to bed . </s> <s> However ; our only real options on location were these fancy restaurants . </s> <s> This was certainly not the most family friendly of options for a hotel with a kid friendly package . ' </s> 
<s> I first walk into the beautifully decorated lobby of the Affinia Chicago hotel where I 'm greeted by name by the concierge . </s> <s> He tells me that they have taken the liberty of customizing the room to my profile from when I booked the stay . </s> <s> He shows me to my room 'paying careful attention to my bags ; and ensuring that I needn 't lift a finger ' sure enough ; the down pillow I had selcted from the dream pillow menu sits proudly atop the queen of the domain ; which by the way is covered with the softest of bedspreads making me wonder if they didn 't literally drag a cloud in here and fit it on my bed . </s> <s> I notice that there 's a display of champagne and cupcakes ' ! ' </s> <s> atop the dresser and my " experience kit " which comes complete with an ipod shuffle downloaded with only my favorite workout tracks ; and a yoga mat . </s> <s> namaste . </s> <s> Unable to resist the urge to inspect the bathroom ; I find that not only is there a marble tiled invisible glass shower ; but a jacuzzi ; lined with candles of vanilla ; deep enough to bathe a walrus . </s> <s> Feeling girlish ; I run the water and test before going to dinner . </s> <s> The Hotel 's restraunt C-house offers the most delicious seafood menu that makes you think you 're dining with the kings of paradise . </s> <s> or at least eating in the Caribbean itself . </s> <s> hmm ; I should have brought a date .

<s> I actually booked this reservation with the hotel over the phone and got a great rate -- much lower than the usual price ! </s> <s> It was a lovely hotel ; beautifully appointed ; walking distance from the places we wanted to go . </s> <s> We would highly recommend the Fairmont . ' </s> 
<s> The Hard Rock Hotel Chicago has become my favorite hotel . </s> <s> I 've stayed there at least 5 times now and have never had anything other than a wonderful experience . </s> <s> As you might have guessed - it has a super Rock ' Roll theme ; with some music paraphanelia in the lobby and on each floor 's elevator lobby . </s> <s> The rooms all have large photo murals that are themed to different musicians . </s> <s> You can request being on the floor of your favorite band 'like KISS ; Aerosmith ; etc . . .

<s> My wife and I recently stayed at the Allegro hotel in Chicago and were extremely disappointed . </s> <s> It claims to be a luxury hotel ; but the air conditioning in our unit wasn 't working and the ice maker in refridgerator was unbearably slow . </s> <s> We phoned in these issues to the front desk and the person on the other end assured us these problems would be taken care of . </s> <s> Noone ever showed up . </s> <s> Aside from that ; there were so many kids running around we couldn 't think straight . </s> <s> This is just my two cents ; but I 'd would tell anyone considering staying at the Allegro to pass and look at their other options .

<s> I was initially very excited to be staying at the Ambassador East hotel . </s> <s> The photos online appeared very classy and upscale and I thought staying there would be a pleasant experience . </s> <s> Upon arrival I was very disappointed - the main lobby was closed for construction making it somewhat difficult to get around . </s> <s> Our room was very dated - old furnishings and linens ; damaged tile - it fell quite short for the high price we paid . </s> <s> It is an older building with very thin walls allowing you to clearly hear all other guests in surrounding rooms and also the lovely slam of doors of departing guests in the morning . </s> <s> Doorways are extremely narrow in hallways and room - gives a very claustrophobic feel to the hotel .

<s> I stayed at the Chicago Fairmont for four nights for a conference . </s> <s> My fiance ' accompanied me . </s> <s> When we checked in ; we were given a room with two full size beds despite the fact that our reservation was for one king size bed . </s> <s> So instead of relaxing on the large luxurious bed we had imagined ; we were forced to either sleep in separate beds like Ward and June Cleaver or either cuddle up on a small full size like two college kids in a fraternity house ! </s> <s> We discovered that the coffee maker wasn 't working and called down to the desk to have someone look at it ; and waited two and half hours . </s> <s> We had issues with the plumbing ; including extremely slow hot water tap in the bathtub which took 45 minutes to fill . </s> <s> The toilet stopped working twice . </s> <s> We returned one afternoon from the art museum to find the maid in our room ; sitting on the bed ; watching the tv and talking on her cell phone . </s> <s> They bellman were rude ; and wouldn 't let my fiance unload our own car which was packed with some of his very expensive camera equipment . </s> <s> There were errors on our bill . </s> <s> Last but not least ; we saw a ROACH in the drawers . </s> <s> Alive . </s> <s> The restaurant downstairs was decent ; and the location is fairly good since my conference was in the Hyatt next door but for the price you can find someplace better . </s> <s> I will never ever stay here again under any circumstances .

<s> Chicago is my favorite city visit . </s> <s> I wanted to share this special city with a new love and booked us a room at the Swissotel . </s> <s> It is advertised as close to downtown and close to the museums of Chicago . </s> <s> I wanted to share my new love . </s> <s> It was indeed close to the museums but to get to either the shopping district or the Chicago Art Institute it was a long walk ; full of detours ; and it was not easy to grab a cab . </s> <s> While the rooms seemed to be luxuriously decorated the beds were uncomfortable and the rooms just were not very clean . </s> <s> The Room Service was slow ; the food arrived cold ; and the total experience was way so expensive for what we got . </s> <s> I do not think I have ever experienced the level of noise in such a " grand hotel " as the Swissotel seems . </s> <s> I would not recommend the Swissotel because disappointment ; noise ; and cold food should just not cost that much .

<s> Months prior to my 5-night reservation with the Hilton Chicago I requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light ; facing an open view ; not a close building . </s> <s> 'The reservation was made through a conference travel agency . ' </s> <s> I confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at check-in the clerk noted it in my record . </s> <s> She told me it would be difficult to find ; but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me . </s> <s> I was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers ; tucked into a very dark corner ; facing a wall of rooms . </s> <s> I called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request ; but to " sit tight " and someone would call me . </s> <s> No one did . </s> <s> Further calls yielded similar results . </s> <s> At one point I was told I could have a " parlor room ; " with a sofa bed ; at a reduced rate ; but I could not go see the room before committing to moving . </s> <s> That 's real hospitality for you . </s> <s> Worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave ; I ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room . </s> <s> 'I had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds . ' </s> <s> The only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms . </s> <s> Other than that ; it was tight quarters with a tiny closet ; two uncomfortably low chairs ; at the desk and in a 'dark ' corner . </s> <s> Light fixtures didn 't do much to brighten things up . </s> <s> Since I was here at a conference ; I really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for mid-day calls and e-mail ; but instead I got a cave . </s> <s> Consequently ; I spent as little time as possible in the room and next time I am in Chicago ; conference or not ; I will absolutely stay at another hotel . </s> <s> There are much better locations that the Hilton Chicago and looking at the percentage of " inside tower " rooms ; places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service . </s> <s> Shame on the Chicago Hilton .

<s> My husband and I stayed overnight at the Affinia . </s> <s> Prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel ; not true . </s> <s> Since it was a very special occasion ; and also because we were only staying overnight ; we didn 't let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend . </s> <s> However ; this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences . </s> <s> I 've ever had . </s> <s> First ; the smells : The linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy . </s> <s> The odors were not mild ; and I found it pretty repulsive . </s> <s> I couldn 't wait to jump out of bed in the morning ; to get away from the odors . </s> <s> Hard to sleep and certainly didn 't want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary . </s> <s> I didn 't discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed . </s> <s> At that point ; I chose not to contact housekeeping because 'a ' I was exhausted ; and 'b ' I didn 't want to upset my husband ; who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing . </s> <s> Also ; the bathroom smelled like vinegar . </s> <s> Perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by Affinia ; but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did . </s> <s> Incidentally ; the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days ; not a well-maintained property . </s> <s> Second ; the elevators : If you stay above the first few floors ; there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop c-view bar . </s> <s> With so many floors to service ; and so many people going up to the c-view bar on a saturday ; these elevators took forever to come ; and were often full they did . </s> <s> Annoying . </s> <s> Also ; on one occasion ; there were several bottles 'water and soda ' left in the elevator ; clearly ; the maintenance crew doesn 't inspect and clean the common areas frequently . </s> <s> Finally ; and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived . </s> <s> First ; when we booked ; we asked for as quiet a room as possible . </s> <s> The hotel is located near Northwestern Memorial Hospital . </s> <s> But ; its proximity to Michigan Ave . ; and the lack of accomodations elsewhere 'due to the Transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same week-end ' ; led us to stay here anyway . </s> <s> At check-in ; the clerk noted our request ; and said our room was quiet room since it was not " next to the elevators . " </s> <s> When we arrived at our room ; we discovered that we were across from the elevators . </s> <s> Obviously ; she was technically correct that we weren 't next to the elevators ; but it was still so close '15-20 feet ' that we could hear the elevator noise . </s> <s> Also ; since it was a special occasion ; we asked if we could upgrade . </s> <s> The disingenuous ; snarky ; condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade . </s> <s> Clearly ; the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels ; this is a matter of routine ; not exception . </s> <s> Pretty awful experience all the way around . </s> <s> Other reviewers must have very low expectations . </s> <s> Can 't explain any of the good reviews otherwise .

<s> My Family and I went to this hotel on holiday last month . </s> <s> It was a very bad hotel . </s> <s> When we got there we imediatly checked in and went up to our room . </s> <s> The view from the window was a brick wall . </s> <s> Really ? </s> <s> We even asked the Lasy at the front desk ; but she said they couldn 't put us in a room with a view cause we didn 't book one and we couldn 't upgrade . </s> <s> Also ; My Wife is a light sleeper and the trains kept her up at night . </s> <s> Another thing is alot of ads boast a hot tub in all the rooms but this is not true ; our room only had a normal tub . </s> <s> But ; the tub had no stopper ; so we could only take showers . </s> <s> The room was also very small compared to other hotels with around the same prices .

<s> The Ambassador Hotel is located in Downtown Chicago right off Lakeshore Drive in the heart of the hotel industry downtown . </s> <s> I would recommend you look to one of those other hotels if you are wanting a place to stay downtown . </s> <s> The rates at this hotel indicate that it would be a top of the line place to stay ; when in fact ; we had a pretty unpleasant experience . </s> <s> It started with someone who was obviously a new employee checking us in . </s> <s> I have no problem with this ; except the fact that this person was the only one on duty and had difficulties checking us in and had no one to assist him . </s> <s> After checking in ; we went up to our room and were a bit disappointed . </s> <s> The pictures do not accurately depict the size of these rooms ; they are very tiny and offer very little room to store luggage where it is out of the way . </s> <s> The beds were not very comfortable and when we called room service for extra pillows ; they took over an hour to arrive . </s> <s> I will not be staying at this hotel anytime in the future .

<s> I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel ; in downtown Chicago . </s> <s> During my three days there I experienced the worst service of my life ! </s> <s> We made reservations before-hand and upon arrival our room was already booked . </s> <s> It took us nearly two hours to actually get into our room 'After being given the wrong key !

<s> Sofitel Chicago Water Tower - My friends and I decided to take a vacation to Chicago following our college graduation and we stayed at the Hotel Sofitel . </s> <s> The rooms were incredible ; it was the first time I slept on a king-sized bed ! </s> <s> All the decor from the little hand soap containers ; to the wall paper had a touch of luxury . </s> <s> We didn 't really spend much time in the hotel bar ; because it was so close to all the nightlife . </s> <s> Likewise ; we chose not to eat too many meals in the hotel ; but the breakfast we had was classy and delicious . </s> <s> The view of Chicago was beautiful and the deal on the room was incredibly reasonable . </s> <s> It was a cool experience .

<s> having stayed in standard hotels before ; when my wife suggested we stay in an upscale hotel for our weekend in Chicago I was skeptical to say the least . </s> <s> After staying at the Amalfi Hotel I may never stay in a regular motel again ! </s> <s> Right off the bat instead of a 40 foot counter with snooty workers or kids that started two days ago they have individual desks for check in with people that 'gasp ' have a clue as to what they are doing . </s> <s> We got the steakhouse package deal at the on-site Keefer 's Steakhouse restaurant the food was the highest quality and cooked to perfection . </s> <s> The room was spacious had robes and slippers ; a stocked mini-bar ; The mattress was comfy ; and the whole room was clean . </s> <s> The staff was amazing and had no problems bringing extra towels and pillows for my wife . </s> <s> In the morning the continental breakfast was served on each floor instead of herding into the lobby which I loved cause I love breakfast but not crowds . </s> <s> Unfortunately for me the hotel was close to a lot of shopping ; my wife was in heaven however ; and we spent a large portion of the day on the magnificent mile attempting to max out my credit cards . </s> <s> The whole trip I believe was made special by the atmosphere of the hotel and its staff I would recommend the Amalfi to anyone visiting Chicago .

<s> I stayed at the Swissotel Chicago while I was on holiday recently and I have to say ; that you definitely get what you pay for ! </s> <s> I was initially attracted by their inexpensive prices for the luxury that they promised . </s> <s> I was sorely mistaken . </s> <s> The first problem I had was when I got there they told me that they had double booked the suite I had reserved . </s> <s> They gave me a discount but had to downgrade me to a regular room . </s> <s> I should have left then but I decided to keep an open mind . </s> <s> After we were all settled in my husband and I went to The Palm restaurant . </s> <s> My husband has food allergies and they got his order wrong so we had to send it back three times . </s> <s> Each time we asked them to fix it ; they stormed off angrily and would return in a huff . </s> <s> After dinner ; we went back to our room . </s> <s> Just sitting on the bed I knew it would be a long night . </s> <s> The mattress was hard and the blankets had a bad smell to them . </s> <s> When I went to the restroom ; the toilet had not been cleaned from the previous patrons ! </s> <s> My husband grabbed a blanket out of the car and we used it instead of the smelly one . </s> <s> We just didn 't want to bother the desk staff after the cold reception when we had walked in . </s> <s> I tried their massage service the next day and the massage therapist was very unprofessional . </s> <s> He pressed really had and hurt my back . </s> <s> Perhaps it was because he was distracted with all the texting he was doing off and on throughout the session ! </s> <s> For lunch we tried Geneva restaurant in the hotel and the food was not cooked all the way . </s> <s> I decided to eat it anyway and got food poisoning about an hour later ! </s> <s> Once I got sick ; I was done . </s> <s> I went to the desk and demanded a refund for the next two nights because I was not going to sleep there one more night . </s> <s> I made a formal complaint with the manager who seemed to act like it was our fault and that we were being unreasonable . </s> <s> After a lot of arguing ; he finally refunded us and we went to a different hotel . </s> <s> This was the worst place I had ever stayed ! </s> <s> I think a Super 8 Motel would have been more luxurious !

<s> This was my first time staying at the Hard Rock hotel in Chicago and I have nothing but hate for the entire experience . </s> <s> The building itself is maintained ; however the staff is rude and inept to the point of making their customers feel physically ill . </s> <s> And while the outside appearance is fine and dandy ; my room 325 ; was repulsive . </s> <s> As soon as the bellboy threw my luggage onto the room 's ground and verbally demanded a tip ; I noticed insects of all kinds scurrying around ; the room was pungent with what smelled like human excrement ; before I could say anything to the bellboy he had taken his tip and fled . </s> <s> Immediately I went to the front desk and was made to wait for over a half hour ; a complete waste of time ; because as soon as I had reported my problem I was told that no other rooms were available and I would have to make do ; they did however say I could stay the night free of charge . </s> <s> The next morning as I was set to leave I decided I would try the breakfast ; in hopes of finding one redeeming quality . </s> <s> Let me tell you ; that breakfast tasted like space food with dirt and mold ; the worst breakfast I have ever had in my entire life . </s> <s> Overall the employees are arrogant and callous ; with the work ethic of a 2 year old child ; they cannot cook ; the room for me was poorly maintained ; however they are good at refunding your money .

<s> I stayed three nights recently at the Hilton Homewood Suites- Downtown Chicago . </s> <s> Overall I can 't rate this establishment highly . </s> <s> The person at the front desk was disorganized- and took over 10 minutes even to find my reservation . </s> <s> Once I finally got my key ; the desk person just thrust the keycard at me like she was happy to be rid of me . </s> <s> It didn 't get any better when I got to my suite . </s> <s> The bed was poorly made ; and I found a couple of long blonde hairs on one of the pillows . </s> <s> The room was very stuffy ; and I swear might have even had a vague pet smell . </s> <s> My shower was not very clean- notable hard water stains on the shower door ; and the bathroom sink had a small continuous drip . </s> <s> Also ; the carpets didn 't seem fresh and even had high traffic dirt noticable . </s> <s> I also visited their small gym 'workout area and was disappointed there also . </s> <s> It had limited equipment that was in poor repair . </s> <s> The floor in there was even slippery ; which made it a definite trip hazard . </s> <s> While the indoor pool looked good ; as I dipped into it ; the water felt a bit slimy and did not have a good smell . </s> <s> All in all ; the amenities ; the unfriendly service ; and the sub-standard cleanliness makes this hotel one I would definitely not recommend to anyone . </s> <s> When that is paired with their sky high room rates ; it 's just not a place that should earn any repeat guests .

<s> Often visit Chicago ; but this was my first stay at this location . </s> <s> Was able to secure a good rate through travelzoo . </s> <s> Thought the room was clean and was nicely decorated . </s> <s> Was very disappointed in the service . </s> <s> Stayed on a Saturday night - waited 20 minutes for extra pillows - called for 15 minutes but found out the third shift crew came in 20 minutes late . </s> <s> Also received an incorrect folio under my door 'another guests that was staying at this location ' . </s> <s> I called the front dest to inform them of the error - and they explained that this was made in error and would be corrected . </s> <s> I opened my credit card statement and found that I was charged for three different rooms - one on the date of my visit and two a week later . </s> <s> I called the hotel and guest services took the information and forwarded to their accounting department . </s> <s> Received a message to call the billing department ; have called three times - but have not received another reply back .

<s> We booked our room at the Swissotel on Hotwire for $88 'unbelievable rate !

<s> Sofitel Chicago Water Tower - Staying at the Sofitel Chicago was honestly a fairly mediocre experience . </s> <s> For the rate that we got ; the room was really underwhelming . </s> <s> A lot of the decor was tacky and the feeling was too forced . </s> <s> The hotel bar was overpriced and when we decided to leave ; the concierge was unhelpful in letting us know about the surrounding nightlife of any sort . </s> <s> The furniture didn 't feel uncomfortable but I woke up in the night several times and didn 't rest well . </s> <s> I would much rather prefer a generic hotel for the money we spent .

<s> WOW ! </s> <s> That is all I can say ! </s> <s> My girlfriends and I recently went on a little 'excursion ' to Chicago for a girls weekend and we stayed at this beautiful hotel . </s> <s> The rooms were beautifully decorated in a comfortable ; modern style . </s> <s> The beds were so comfortable and cozy with the softest bedding I have ever felt on a hotel bed . </s> <s> Our views were just as amazing . </s> <s> We could even see Lake Michigan from our suite . </s> <s> We only dined in the hotel once during our trip ; but it was the best time we had . </s> <s> The Aria Restaurant was so elegant yet fun . </s> <s> Very clean and just a great atmosphere . </s> <s> The staff was extremely professional and courteous ; going out of their way to ensure our stay was a pleasure from the moment we walked through their doors . </s> <s> Highly recommended ! </s> <s> A must see next time you visit this area .

<s> I had stayed at Amalfi for my weekend visit to Chicago . </s> <s> The hotel was easy to find and was close to many establishments for a night in the city . </s> <s> The valet staff was pleasant and courteous . </s> <s> The room was very comfortable and spacious with a large bathroom . </s> <s> The free WiFi was a big plus . </s> <s> Being a frequent traveler myself ; I have frequently faced problems with hotel food . </s> <s> However ; Amalfi provided a breakfast bar on each floor with delicious pastries . </s> <s> For dinner ; I was able to order food from Harry Caray 's Tavern from across the street . </s> <s> I was pleasantly surprised at food options available . </s> <s> I am totally in love with this hotel and would highly recommend it to my friends .

<s> The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower ; while seemingly a good idea in theory ; has many drawbacks . </s> <s> At first glance ; it appears quite luxurious and grand ; but some of its shortcomings cannot be overlooked . </s> <s> The hotel is quite tall ; coming in at 32 stories ; and the noise from adjoining floors and rooms is sometimes quite annoying . </s> <s> The staff members do little to try to ameliorate the situation for the dissatisfied guest ; so it seems as if your pleas for help go unnoticed . </s> <s> The hotel tries to adopt a French flavor ; but its efforts fall short . </s> <s> The only real French influences are found in the names of restaurants and bars . </s> <s> The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city ; but this location also adds to the less-than-cozy feel of the establishment . </s> <s> The same complaint about the guest rooms and noise applies to the hotel in general . </s> <s> The city 's traffic and noise both detract from the ability to fully enjoy one 's stay here . </s> <s> Overall ; I would not recommend this hotel . </s> <s> Make a different choice .

<s> For all the hype and rave reviews of the Talbott Hotel ; it seemed to me that it would be a mistake to NOT stay there ; not the other way around . </s> <s> The Talbott Hotel website claims to have " opulent accommodations ; impeccable service ; and unexpected delights . " </s> <s> The last time I checked ; " opulent " had a bit of a different meaning than " easily outdone by the senile 90-year-old landlord of your college apartment ; " " impeccable " wasn 't code for " rude and unfriendly ; " and " unexpected delights " were more fun than a faint but obvious stain on your sheets at a hotel . </s> <s> Overall ; my stay here simply wasn 't worth the money or the hassle involved in making the correct reservations . </s> <s> For a lot less ; I could have been treated rudely and had a mediocre stay in a more casual environment .

<s> Stayed in old tower . </s> <s> Room was nice and room service was very good . </s> <s> Room Wi-Fi was expensive as was the bottled water . </s> <s> For the price of the room ; at least there should at least have been water . </s> <s> I would rate the value as sub-par . </s> <s> The restaurant menu was not great ; food mediocre by comparison to other downtown Chicago restaurants and the service was below average especially since there were only three tables in use in the entire restaurant . . </s> <s> In summary ; I will go to the M . . . </s> <s> or H . . . </s> <s> next time . </s> <s> Some of the above comments are based on a previous week resort stay on the outer banks of North Carolina and earlier this year in Northern California . </s> <s> P .

<s> We stayed at Hotel Monaco and upgraded to a suite . </s> <s> I was disappointed with the room layout ; and shabby furniture . </s> <s> I bumped into the coffee table and the top almost crashed to the ground . </s> <s> The make up mirror in the bathroom didnt work ; the TV reception was very poor and overall the room just wasnt worth the $450 we spent there . </s> <s> Next time ; we will go back to Trump Tower across the street ; which is far superior to Hotel Monaco .

<s> Did not enjoy my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel . </s> <s> Firstly ; the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful . </s> <s> There was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle . </s> <s> Secondly when we finally got the reservation sorted out ; the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees . </s> <s> Considering I paid well over $250 per night for the Romance package reservation ; it was below my standards and I will not be heading back to the Omni Chicago Hotel any time soon .

<s> I booked a room at Swissotel Chicago because I thought the price was reasonable ; and at the base price it was ; however ; it ended up costing more than I had planned for ; as you have to pay for parking and other amenities . </s> <s> The service was not very good ; considering they market themselves as a luxury hotel . </s> <s> There was no one there to help us bring in our bags when we had a difficult time doing so ; and the staff were cold . </s> <s> All in all ; I would say it was an average experience . . . </s> <s> not luxurious like they claim it to be .

<s> Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago - Despite its somewhat odd name ; I found staying at this hotel to be a delightful experience . </s> <s> Spacious hallways and high-ceilinged lobby give the feel of a mansion as you walk in . </s> <s> The rooms maintain this atmosphere ; as they are impeccably cleaned and tastefully furnished . </s> <s> The beds are nice and soft and very easy to fall asleep in . </s> <s> Free coffee every morning ; excellent for coffee lovers like myself . </s> <s> One thing to watch out for : The texture of the towels feels a bit rough . </s> <s> Might want to bring you own . </s> <s> But this is only a minor distraction from an otherwise great stay . </s> <s> I highly recommend the Millennium Knickerbocker .

<s> Staying at the Swissotel in downtown Chicago is not so much the typical stay so much as it is an experience . </s> <s> Not only is the hotel located in a great area to get to all local attractions ; but while you are at the hotel you will have many amazing accommodations at your disposal . </s> <s> There are two gourmet on site restaurants and a lounge to relax and get great food . </s> <s> The rooms are over sized and the beds are among the most comfortable you will ever find . </s> <s> Finally ; the service is award winning so anything that you do not already have at the Swissotel will be at your fingertips with their assistance . </s> <s> Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for more than the typical hotel .

<s> Very quaint and romantic ; yet masculine . </s> <s> I 've noticed that at most Chicago hotel bars it 's hard to get a drink much less a seat but I guess because it 's a small hotel that was not a problem at the Talbott - plus people take their drinks out to the seating in the lobby because it 's so inviting - cozy and comfortable - love that ! </s> <s> Would love to stay again but I must say that I was surprised by all the comments on the comfortable beds - ours was too firm . </s> <s> Also note there is no gym on the premises - but walking and shopping is enough of a workout !

<s> The Hotel Sofitel Chicago Water Tower bills itself as a 4-star luxury hotel ; but the luxury is evidently in the eye of the beholder . </s> <s> Filled with trite modern art and modular ; cheap-looking furniture that looks straight out of the latest Ikea catalogue ; this 32-floor hunk of glass has to be one of the ugliest hotels I have ever seen . </s> <s> " Urban chic " design does not equal comfort ; the seating and bed furniture are made more for the design floor than for actual use . </s> <s> Room service is expensive ; slow ; and the food you eventually do get is mediocre in quality and flavor . </s> <s> The hotel features two bars : the Cafe des Architectes Bar ; and the simply named Le Bar . </s> <s> Cutesy French names and trendy modern outfittings do not a good hotel bar make ! </s> <s> Excellent service ; fair prices ; friendly and competent staff are what make a bar great ; none of which you will find at either of these bars . </s> <s> Cafe des Architectes is also a restaurant ; offering " seasonal menus featuring contemporary cuisine with French roots ; " which means small portions and large prices at questionable quality . </s> <s> Even the old standby filet mignon did not stand up to its reputation ; coming out a little dry hunk of meat rather than a succulent steak . </s> <s> Pass this one by ; if you 're looking for a comfortable ; enjoyable stay in downtown Chicago . </s> <s> The Water Tower is dry .

<s> Location ; location ; location . </s> <s> What a great find ! </s> <s> Excellent ; well-run ; small boutique-type hotel on a tree-lined street near all the action without being in the oppressive crunch of it . </s> <s> Rooms are good-sized and clean ; good bed and shower with tub . </s> <s> The air conditioner ; as mentioned in other reviews ; is noisy ; but it 's a minor complaint . </s> <s> The staff is simply wonderful and attentive from housecleaning to concierge . </s> <s> The on site restaurant is great . </s> <s> The red-line El is about 3-4 blocks away which makes getting around the city a breeze . </s> <s> You are footsteps away from Rush Street and North Michigan Avenue and Lake Michigan . </s> <s> I would not have a moment 's hesitation booking at this hotel again in the future ; in fact ; I wouldn 't book anywhere else .

<s> Hilton Chicago - Hilton Chicago is definitely a good option if you want to spend some quiet time in the city . </s> <s> It is not that close to the downtown but you can go to the lakefront and the aquariums nearby . </s> <s> The architecture of the lobby and rooms gives a feel of history . </s> <s> This is one those places with updated service but old-style charm . </s> <s> You suddenly feel like you are in a different era . </s> <s> I liked the health club and saunas . </s> <s> The rooms were comfortable but I could see a little tear on the walls . </s> <s> But overall ; ideal place to stay for a vacation ! !

<s> My experience at the Ambassador East Hotel was truly terrible . </s> <s> I went to Chicago with my husband and children to attend a wedding . </s> <s> This hotel was recommended by the wedding party . </s> <s> It was a terrible choice . </s> <s> Despite the special discount we got because of the wedding ; the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels . </s> <s> The staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children . </s> <s> My kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason . </s> <s> The place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items . </s> <s> My son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart . </s> <s> Overall ; I would say I was very displeased with the staff ; the hotel 's attitude towards children ; and the expense of the hotel . </s> <s> On the plus side ; our window had an excellent view of the city . </s> <s> Still ; I would not return here again .

<s> This hotel has a great location ; and very friendly staff . </s> <s> However ; the physical condition of the property has certainly fallen behind the competition . </s> <s> I use to be a regular at this hotel ... </s> <s> but have not been back for 15 years . </s> <s> Rooms have not been well maintained 'old carpets frayed at doors ' ; wall paper peeling off of the walls ; TV 's from the 80 's . </s> <s> There is currently construction going on in the lobby area ; making it impossible to get to the restaurant without leaving the hotel and walking to an outside door .

<s> After reading some of the most recent reviews I 'm really perplexed . </s> <s> I didn 't know what to expect ; but I was most pleasantly surprised . </s> <s> Just as all the past reviews ; both negative and positive ; have stated ; you can 't beat the location of this hotel . </s> <s> It 's perfect . </s> <s> We had a big spacious room in the old tower . </s> <s> We avoided the expensive pitfalls of the hotel extras such as bottled water and items in the room fridge . </s> <s> The beds were great ; the rooms were kept clean and the staff was very friendly . </s> <s> Great martinis in the hotel bar . </s> <s> I really can 't understand the negative reviews . </s> <s> I know you can 't please everyone ; but in some cases I simply don 't believe their claims . </s> <s> I 've traveled a lot and have stayed in plenty of hotels . </s> <s> This is a great hotel !

<s> The Talbott Hotel - Stayed at the Talbott last weekend with some friends ; and it 's fair to say that we were all disappointed in our stay . </s> <s> Four of us stayed in a room with two queen beds ; and while we thought it would be enough space for all of us ; it was anything but that . </s> <s> The main room itself actually had a large amount of open floor space ; however ; it was actually too much space given what could 've been provided . </s> <s> You 'd think a room with that much space would have more useful furniture ; like usable table . </s> <s> The only furniture they provided were two arm chairs and two tiny side tables . </s> <s> All four of us were students ; yet not a single one of us could find an acceptable surface with which to do work on ; despite having ample floor space for a desk or table . </s> <s> The room is advertised for 2-4 people ; but the bathroom would not be able to support 3 adults ; let alone four . </s> <s> There was no space to move around the bathroom despite having two sinks ; essentially rendering parallel use in the bathroom absolutely useless . </s> <s> Poor spacing 'design by the architects . </s> <s> The in-house restaurant was also a bit disappointing ; it felt like all the effort went into the ambiance and decor ; but none went into finding decent chefs ! </s> <s> The table they gave us in the corner of the resturant was a bit cramped as well . </s> <s> Location was farther from the University of Chicago than we would 've liked ; but it was aleast close to Washington Square Park . </s> <s> All-in-all ; the hotel is decent at best ; especially for the high price they charge . </s> <s> There are probably better options in Chicago ; in my opinion .

<s> My family chose to stay at the Chicago Hilton during our last trip to the city . </s> <s> We wanted something luxurious and centrally-located without having to pay exorbitant prices . </s> <s> I can honestly say we made an excellent decision in picking the Hilton . </s> <s> The staff treated us well ; the rooms were clean and roomy 'we loved the Serenity beds ' ; and the hotel itself is stunning . </s> <s> It was like stepping back in time . </s> <s> We loved that the Chicago Hilton was close to numerous attractions . </s> <s> The weather was lovely ; so it was great to walk to Navy Pier ; Sears Tower ; and the Adler Planetarium . </s> <s> We will definitely stay at the Hilton the next time we are in Chicago .

<s> I really wish I could say that I liked this hotel ; but the whole experience was just plain awful . </s> <s> My first warning sign should have been when I made my reservation . </s> <s> The person I spoke with when placing my reservation had absolutely no idea what he was doing . </s> <s> At first he tried to book me into the wrong hotel ; and then when we finally got it sorted which hotel I was actually wanting ; he booked me for the wrong dates . </s> <s> He read me the right dates ; and it was only when I called back two days later to confirm that I found out he 'd given me the wrong dates . </s> <s> Hilton did get it fixed ; but I already had a bad feeling about my stay . </s> <s> Then came actually staying at the hotel . </s> <s> The people at the check-in desk were downright rude . </s> <s> Then there was the room . </s> <s> I was supposed to be in a non-smoking room ; but the room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke . </s> <s> The hotel staff refused to believe me ; but did let me change rooms to one that didn 't smell of cigarettes . </s> <s> However ; I might as well have stayed in the first room . </s> <s> I was short towels ; and it took four calls 'over a period of 12 hours ' to the front desk to get some . </s> <s> The sheets had not been changed ; made obvious by the crumbs and fresh stains that littered them . </s> <s> Yes ; I was able to get fresh sheets ; but like the towels ; it took several hours for them to be delivered . </s> <s> Since this is a pet friendly hotel ; lucky me I got stuck in the room next to the room filled with yappy little dogs . </s> <s> The walls were so paper thin ; all I could hear all night was barking . </s> <s> When I complained about it ; the staff refused to believe me ; and said that the walls of the room are so thick I shouldn 't be able to hear anything from next door . </s> <s> Yeah right . </s> <s> I was excited to use the pool ; but just like my room ; it hadn 't been cleaned recently . </s> <s> Then ; I tried the fitness center . </s> <s> Half the equipment was broken . </s> <s> I tried to cut my stay short ; but of course this hotel wouldn 't work with me at all . </s> <s> They even refused to comp my stay for all the grossness I had to deal with . </s> <s> I will never stay with Hilton again ; and I will be sure to let everyone know what a nightmare this stay was .

<s> We recently completed our first visit to Chicago and were pleasantly surprised by the Affinia Chicago hotel where we stayed . </s> <s> The hotel has gone to great lengths to offer extra services to their guests ; including individual pillow choices ; complimentary kits with items designed to enhance the city visit ; and fine dining in two on-site restaurants ; one of them roof-top with amazing city views . </s> <s> I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago . ' </s> 
<s> Stayed over Memorial Weekend for 2 nites ; 2 rooms . </s> <s> Great Hotel ; we always love breakfast in morning ; and drinks in even when applicable . </s> <s> Around the corner from magnificent Mile ; and close to lots of restaurants . </s> <s> Staff was great ; we even checked in early before noon ; and other room available less than hour later . </s> <s> Fresh fruit was available to us ; and bell guys are cool . </s> <s> Suites are on small side compared to other homewoods but no complaints here ; house cleaning kept our room clean ; and we felt safe !

<s> Upon entering Homewood Suites ; I was greeted by incredibly friendly staff and my breath was taken by the beauty of the hotel . </s> <s> When I saw my room ; I was immediately relieved because it provided all of the amenities needed for my week-long business stay 'refrigerator ; microwave ; stove ; dishwasher ; flat panel TV ' . </s> <s> Best of all ; the hotel has an on-site fitness center where I was able to work off all of the extra calories I consumed during the delicious complimentary breakfast . </s> <s> I couldn 't resist their omelettes ! </s> <s> The hotel is in the heart of Chicago and I must say ; the city view from my room was priceless . </s> <s> Definitely recommended !

<s> No excuse for a hotel like this to have cold showers on three consecutive days and then to tell customer that engineering will look at it and that we should have told them sooner . </s> <s> I wouldn 't expect a cold shower at a budget hotel ; let alone an Omni . </s> <s> Great location and the bar is nice . ' </s> 
<s> The Omni Chicago Hotel offers all the great amenities in comfort that is expected of a luxury hotel ; particularly speedy and easy wireless internet access and nice-sized plasma tv 's . </s> <s> The windows are big enough to give a spectacular view of the city skyline while reclining on a great sofa in a comfortable and luxurious living room ; before sleeping in a king-sized bed of either feather or foam pillows ; which is particularly relaxing after taking a bath or shower in the spacious bathroom . </s> <s> An in-room massage appointment will add an additional relaxing aspect to the stay . </s> <s> There 's even an exercise kit within the room for extra convince . </s> <s> However ; the vast fitness center is just as worthy to use ; as well as the whirlpool ; Jacuzzi and the indoor swimming pool . </s> <s> Sunbathing is an easy activity to achieve via the two rooftop sundecks . </s> <s> A nice aspect that isn 't so common to find is the ability to have small pets stay with you in the hotel . </s> <s> The Omni Chicago is a great way to add a bit of luxury to any type of vacation ; particularly when you don 't want to be separated from your pet ; within the area .

<s> We were at the Hotel Allegro for an Industry Analyst event . </s> <s> I could not have expected worse . </s> <s> At first glance ; you figured it couldn 't be too bad as a Kimpton . </s> <s> The unfortunate issue - service and the people were excellent . </s> <s> However ; the rooms just sucked . </s> <s> Imagine your normal hotel room and 1 '3 that size . </s> <s> Cramp in a king size bed and add a bathroom that 's also 1 '3 the size . </s> <s> The building has that old hotel smell where things are musky but covered up with some paint smell . </s> <s> The bathroom has showers with modern fixtures but remind you of that nyc studio you rented with 5 other people out of college . </s> <s> The paints peeling on the base boards ; the carpet is new ; but something is wrong . </s> <s> I would stay at the Marriott ; Renaissance ; Westin ; or any where else .

<s> We stayed here for one night ; and found it a hotel that concentrates on conferences rather than your normal guest . </s> <s> We found it hard to get a room in the city for that particular night and so we paid above the odds for this - ' $200 for the night . </s> <s> We felt when we checked in that if you weren 't with the conference ; then why were we staying in the hotel . </s> <s> The guy at the main door didn 't even hold it open when you are trying to lug your bags into the lobby ; we then had to que for 15-20 minutes just to check in . </s> <s> We were not given any information about the hotel and when I rang down to reception at one stage to find out if there was a business centre in the hotel that I could access the Internet through ; I was just short of being asked why didn 't I bring my lap-top with me so I could use the Internet access in the room . . . . </s> <s> ! ! </s> <s> I found the staff very rude and not helpful at all and would not recommend this hotel for a tourist .

<s> Perfect location ; clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay . </s> <s> Its in an area with plenty of stores ' The Mile ' and restaurants . </s> <s> Hotel lobby is on the 6th floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall I would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family ; friends or on business . </s> <s> The subway to Wrigley is a 1 '2 block away from the front door .

<s> I arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from California . </s> <s> I didn 't know about the renovation when I made the reservations ; but that didn 't bother me very much . </s> <s> I was helped by a man at the front desk named Ben ; who was friendly enough ; but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay . </s> <s> He gave me NO information about anything . </s> <s> I had no idea where breakfast was served ; or even if there WAS breakfast . </s> <s> There was also an EXTREMELY unpleasant woman working behind the desk 'she wasn 't wearing a name tag but was African American ; slim with short hair ' who seemed to be actually radiating hostility . </s> <s> It made me very uncomfortable and needless to say ; made me feel unwelcome . </s> <s> I actually felt like I was putting her out by staying in the hotel . </s> <s> I encountered her again the next morning when I had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit ; and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness . </s> <s> I also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners . </s> <s> No matter what may be going on in one 's life ; when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile . </s> <s> I was appalled by her demeanor . </s> <s> My room was alright ; there was no clock which I found very odd . </s> <s> Since I came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and I was constantly confused as to which one was correct ; especially upon waking up in the morning . </s> <s> It would have been nice to have a clock . </s> <s> There was also no literature on local sites ; maps ; restaurant menus ; or even anything with the hotel 's name and address in the room . </s> <s> Also ; the mattress was the absolute worst mattress I 've ever slept on in my life . </s> <s> I woke up every morning with a sore back and neck . </s> <s> I 've had better sleep on a hard ; lumpy futon . </s> <s> It was absurd . </s> <s> Like another person posted ; my tub did not drain either ; and I was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found . </s> <s> Maybe they were around somewhere ; but I wasn 't made aware of it at check-in ; and I didn 't want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like I was a burden to the employees . </s> <s> The hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance ; but I absolutely would not stay here again . </s> <s> I 've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel ; which was a bummer because it was my first visit to Chicago and I had pretty high expectations .

<s> I had heard good things about the Ambassador East and decided to stay there on vacation with my husband -- what a mistake ! </s> <s> First off ; they charge for being able to use the internet ; which should be a given these days ; especially for how much you pay for the room . </s> <s> The " champagne " was cheap ; I could have spent $15 to get my own bottle . </s> <s> The King room was just as small as a double room anyway . </s> <s> The bed was really hard ; and crudely made . </s> <s> Maybe there was someone new on the staff that didn 't know how to make a bed ; but besides that ; the sheets were starched to military stiffness . </s> <s> It was so uncomfortable ! </s> <s> When I asked if we might get some new sheets ; the staff were so incredibly rude and told me I was basically stuck with what I had because they 're " all that way " . </s> <s> I was appalled ! </s> <s> Anyway ; we gave it a shot and stayed there that night ; in the mediocre luster of the room design . </s> <s> We didn 't sleep well and didn 't particularly enjoy ourselves ; especially because apparently there was a wedding going on in the building because we could hear the party ! </s> <s> I mean ; talk about the opposite of peaceful ! </s> <s> Again ; we tried appealing to the staff to have our room moved away from the party ; but they said they couldn 't move us because of the romance package . </s> <s> What a jip ! </s> <s> After the kind of " fun " we 'd had ; we realized we couldn 't handle anymore . </s> <s> We called for a manager the next morning and fought with him for a couple hours . </s> <s> We wanted to just cancel the second night of our stay ; and he said he 'd do that ; but that we 'd still be charged a percentage of it ! </s> <s> After telling him everything that had happened and how displeased we were ; we finally got him to not charge us and left to go stay at another hotel that was actually relaxing .

<s> Ambassador East - I had a really bad experience at this hotel . </s> <s> I stayed here with my girlfriend during Christmas and their bed was horrible . </s> <s> It made some creaking noise and when we complained about this to the reception ; they said that they could not do anything about it . </s> <s> Also ; the next day morning ; there was no hot water in the shower . </s> <s> they said there was some maintanance going on which would finish in half an hour hour . </s> <s> We waited for more than an hour and still no hot water . </s> <s> And the helpdesk was so rude that we did not even feel like talking to them . </s> <s> Horrible place to stay ! !

<s> The hotel is excellently situated for visiting The Art Institute or Millennium Park . </s> <s> It is an " old classic " of a hotel ; and the main lobby is a must see ; but I would not stay there again . </s> <s> The problem with any hotel dating from long ago 'the current one was built in 1923-25 ' is that ; even with extensive remodeling 'which was done in 2007-2009 ' it is hard to create spaces that are comparable to what is expected today 'in many cases the walls are load bearing so cannot be changed too much ' . </s> <s> We had a reasonably sized room 'king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair ' but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries . </s> <s> Also ; there was no coffee machine in the room - something I have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days . </s> <s> My major complaint about this stay was the Executive Lounge . </s> <s> It is usually worth while to pay the extra for access - in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors d 'oeuvres in the evening along with a modest wine at a modest price . </s> <s> 'Since we are currently at the diamond level in the Hilton Honors program ; we get access for free at the Hiltons but I usually upgrade at other chains such as the Hyatt . ' </s> <s> At the Palmer Executive Lounge I ordered a couple of glasses of wine 'there was a bartender on duty ' and was slightly surprised by the cost - $9 'glass which came to $21 . 44 for two with tax and tip - and was even more surprised by the wine . </s> <s> It was about the worst wine I had tasted in many years . </s> <s> I didn 't think it was even as good as Trader Joe 's cheapest $2 . 99 wine that I tried a couple of weeks ago . </s> <s> Unfortunately I didn 't get a look at the bottle to see what it was 'although I did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard ' . </s> <s> I noticed that a couple of groups in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in - and I can understand iot at the prices they were charging . </s> <s> It then occurred to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time . </s> <s> I checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red wines by the glass - the same three varietals as at the bar . </s> <s> The cabernet was a William Hill at $10 . 50 'glass from room service . </s> <s> I presume that what I had had at some time been a William Hill that had been left to turn to vinegar . </s> <s> It was slightly more expensive from room service ; but I hope that it was in a lot better condition .

<s> I have traveled to Chicago many times for business ; and so I have expectations of hotels based on reasonable comparisons . </s> <s> There was nothing dramatically wrong the Sheraton ; but it was simply overpriced for the quality of the hotel . </s> <s> It almost looked as if an accountant walk through the hotel looking for places to cut costs . </s> <s> The carpets were old ; there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom ; towels and linens were older than I expected ; the rooms were in need of some redecorating ; etc . </s> <s> during the week I was paying $349 per night for a room ; and it simply was not near the quality I expected for that price . </s> <s> One positive to notice that the fitness room was quite good . </s> <s> Plenty of aerobic machines with TVs ; weights ; etc . </s> <s> location is also quite good 'perhaps the reason for the high price ' with close walks to Michigan Avenue and the river . </s> <s> In summary ; I think you can find a much nicer hotel in a much better price in downtown Chicago .

<s> The Millennium Hotel Knickerbocker sounds fine ; and the website is pretty ; but the reality is an over-hyped ; overpriced ; reality-isn 't-as-good-as-fantasy package . </s> <s> The catering they offer is a joke ; you can pick up better food for half the price at a dozen or more places in the Chicago area . </s> <s> While the rooms were cleaner than most ; there was a lingering unpleasant odor from the cleaners they used that aggravated my sinuses ; and when I called to complain about it ; a nasal-voiced clerk blew me off . </s> <s> The rooms look small but cozy when you book online ; but when you get there in person ; you realize just how tiny they are . </s> <s> Trying to fit inside of one makes you think of being in a sardine can -- did I mention that it smelled like cleaning solution ? </s> <s> I also found a hair on my supposedly clean bed ; which made me wonder just how thorough their housekeeping staff is . </s> <s> In fact ; it looks like all of their rooms are comparatively small ; you 'd get better prices and a far better room from the Hilton .

" </s> <s> So much for the great reviews about service ... </s> <s> I couldn 't even get past the first phone call without being frustrated and annoyed . </s> <s> Bad form ; Conrad ; bad form .

<s> The Intercontinental Chicago Magnificent Mile The outside of the hotel itself is as the name says is pretty magnificent despite being set in what has to be the filthiest section in the city . </s> <s> For the cost of the rooms starting at 179 . 00 a night ; you would think they would have a competent parking attendant . </s> <s> I was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room ; and if that was not enough . </s> <s> To top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork . </s> <s> Needless to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account . </s> <s> I would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations .

<s> Amalfi Hotel Chicago - Concierge was extremely pleasant and helpful . </s> <s> The room was spacious and the beds were super comfortable 'better than my bed at home ' ! </s> <s> One thing I was not happy with - one of the glass cups they provided was not cleaned very well . </s> <s> I usually never use the in-room glasses just for that reason ; so I called and had them bring some paper cups . </s> <s> Other than that ; absolutely no complaints . </s> <s> The free Wi-Fi was much appreciated for keeping up with emails etc . </s> <s> Not to mention the beautiful view !

<s> WARNING : FOOD POISONING ALERT ! ! ! </s> <s> The room was dirty ; the shower had mold and the handle in the shower my daughter cracked her head open on . </s> <s> The elevators were absolutly terrible they made me dizzy every time i went on it . </s> <s> They hade pasta night and they put out a bowl of noodles and sauce and i couple of rolls well you get what you pay for . </s> <s> What was worse is the sauce must of had bad meat in it because my family got so sick . </s> <s> The one thing that was nice was the location which was right by michigan avenue . </s> <s> The second night we left and went to another hotel which was 80 bucks cheaper and 100 times nicer . </s> <s> DO NOT STAY HERE '
<s> It was my first time to visit Chicago and I would say ; i 'd definitely go back ; not just because of the Air and Water Show that we really enjoyed ; but most importantly ; because of the hotel that we stayed in . </s> <s> The Millennium Knickerbocker is not just accommodating to their human guests ; but with pets too . </s> <s> At first I was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog ; but I was surprised it turned out the other way . </s> <s> I 've experienced being denied reservations because of my dog and that 's really frustrating ; it 's just nice that there still are other hotels that are pet friendly . </s> <s> I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends if they plan to visit Chicago .

<s> James Hotels --- The hotel was a nice place to stay . </s> <s> I was amazed by the beautiful interiors and the fact that they allowed pets . </s> <s> Next time I wont have to leave my pet at home . </s> <s> The one bedroom apartment I stayed in ; was spacious and comfortable ; not to forget the relaxing bathroom ! </s> <s> Most importantly ; I did not miss my gym . </s> <s> Your gym had almost everything I needed . </s> <s> Next time I would love to explore more into your menu of services . </s> <s> I enjoyed shopping around the magnificent mile . </s> <s> While leaving Chicago ; I had a flight early morning ; which I had informed the staff earlier . </s> <s> They gave me a wake up call and even packed me breakfast for the journey ; which was quite fresh and tasty . </s> <s> Their Audi cab facility ; I must say ; was quite a relief . </s> <s> I will recommend the Lake hotel to my company HR for any business visits to Chicago . </s> <s> Thanks for the wonderful stay and food .

<s> I had a great experience staying at the Conrad Chicago ; the service was top notch ; the price was good ; but out of everything the service was outstanding . </s> <s> I would definitely stay there again when in the area and would suggest it to anyone looking for a good quality hotel in a great location . </s> <s> Right next to the shops at North Bridge ! ' </s> 
<s> I stayed at the millennium Knickerbocker for 3 nights while on a business trip ; as it was conveniently located a few blocks away from the office I was visiting ; and just about everything else for that matter . </s> <s> The lobby was absolutely beautiful ; and the staff was beyond courteous and extremely helpful . </s> <s> The rooms were elegant and spacious ; and I instantly felt right at home . </s> <s> The large flat screen TV as a nice touch and TV options were many . </s> <s> I headed downstairs to the bar for a drink ; and was amazed at how well kept it was ; as well as how nice everybody was . </s> <s> As this was my first time I asked the bartender about the area around and he gave me great advice about some places to check out . </s> <s> All in all this was a great experience ; and next time I 'm in the area ; I will definitely be staying here . </s> <s> I 'd recommend the Millennium Knickerbocker to anyone traveling to Chicago .

<s> I chose to stay at the 'Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel ' during a recent trip to Chicago because I had heard they had good reviews . </s> <s> Boy ; were these reviews wrong ! ! </s> <s> I had terrible service from the moment I walked in the doors . </s> <s> I was not greeted by the receptionist ; it was like I wasn 't even there . </s> <s> My room was NOT ready for me when I got there ; even though I got there AFTER my required check-in time ; then once I was allowed to go to my room ; it was filthy ! </s> <s> It was as if they didn 't even clean it ; so I don 't know what the hold up was . </s> <s> There were no towels ; shampoo or soap in the bathroom . </s> <s> The worst part was that there were bugs in the tub ! </s> <s> The place was the most disgusting place I 've ever been to ; and it is supposed to be one of the nicest ! </s> <s> It should be the nicest for the price they charge . </s> <s> I do not recommend staying here ! </s> <s> Stay at your own risk ! !

<s> While it was a nice hotel ; but i am rather frustrated with them ! </s> <s> During our stay our room was cleaned twice by housekeeping . </s> <s> The first day was fine . </s> <s> Second day my diamond earrings came up missing . </s> <s> Noticed they were missing while in the packing up and checking out process . </s> <s> My biggest mistake was not staying there and dealing with this further . </s> <s> But we had a family reunion and funeral to get to . </s> <s> While the front desk was great and said they would handle it ; I believe they say these things just to get you to go on about your way ! </s> <s> We filed a police report and the GM of the hotel is supposed to be working on it . </s> <s> We have called several times but receive no answers . </s> <s> They keep telling us the cleaning staff have been there 10 ' years . . . . . that dosen 't matter to me ! </s> <s> If they are not held accountable what 's to stop them from taking anything . </s> <s> There is a dishwasher in the room ; and they found my daughters ring 'which was in the same glass with my diamond earrings ' in the dishwasher . </s> <s> They say I put the cup in the dishwasher . </s> <s> First ; I am on vacation ; trust me i 'm NOT doing dishes ! </s> <s> Second ; why would I wash one glass and leave the other dirty dishes in the room ? </s> <s> So ; while it is a nice hotel . . . . lock up your things of value ! </s> <s> They may come up " missing " and you 'll be left frustrated ! !

<s> My family and I were in Chicago for a friend 's wedding . </s> <s> We had asked around to find a hotel that was nice ; but affordable and were pointed in the direction of the InterContinental Chicago hotel . </s> <s> The hotel appeared very nice ; and to have all the amenities : Room service ; WiFi ; clean rooms . </s> <s> Unfortunately ; as it turned out ; appearances can be deceiving . </s> <s> It begins at the desk ; where the clerk was downright rude and uncaring . </s> <s> He said they didn 't have any rooms available because we didn 't make arrangements . </s> <s> It was getting late ; and we had no place to go ; there weren 't any hotels nearby and my kids were starving . </s> <s> I asked if there was anything he could do ; and he said that I will have to ask someone else because he was busy . </s> <s> I talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing ; the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night . </s> <s> Apparently ; our expectations for what would be the normal amenities for a hotel stay was above standard ; because this room wasn 't even clean and the wifi didn 't work . </s> <s> We ordered room service ; and it never came ; even after several complaints . </s> <s> It doesn 't end there either ; when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us for the room service . </s> <s> Overall ; this was a very frustrating experience ; and I wouldn 't stay there again .

<s> conrad - I was extremely unhappy with the attitude of this hotel 's staff toward customer satisfaction . </s> <s> I specifically asked for a big room on one of the lower floor because I have fear for heights ; but instead they put me on the top floor of their building . </s> <s> When I asked for an exchange they said they were full . </s> <s> Would not come again . ' </s> 
<s> Homewood Suites- I wish I had nicer things to say about this hotel- my most recent trip to Chicago was actually pretty enjoyable ; but only because I didn 't have to spend too much time in my hotel room . </s> <s> The room was filthy ; I came in to see some strange pair of underwear on my bed ! </s> <s> It took room service all day to come by and take care of it . </s> <s> Then there was the issue with the car- I needed to bring my car on this particular visit to the Windy City ; and the hotel charged me $42 a day to keep it in their lot ! </s> <s> Outrageous if you ask me . </s> <s> I will give credit where credit is due ; though ; and say that the pool was lovely . </s> <s> But the gym was disgusting and sweaty . </s> <s> The absolutely need to clean up their act if they ever want my business again . ' </s>

<s> The Talbott Hotel was very classy ; professional ; and luxurious . </s> <s> I loved how the staff was nice and respectful . </s> <s> I was treated like i was royalty when i was there ; when in checked i was greeted by all of the people working behind the front desk and was offered a tour of the hotel . </s> <s> They took my bags and put them in my room while i was taking the tour and they even escorted me to my room right after we were done . </s> <s> This is a very nice and modern looking and their rooms are spacious and clean unlike other hotels in their area . </s> <s> I have recommended this hotel to all of my family and friends and would recommend it to anyone who is going to stay in that area .

<s> This hotel is in a great city with great personnel working there . </s> <s> The rooms are more than you can expect for a hotel . </s> <s> The services are abundant ; leaving no room to complain . </s> <s> With their fine diners ; you cannot go wrong with enjoying a peaceful meal while relaxing . </s> <s> With this hotel ; it is truly an all-in-one hotel . </s> <s> There are meeting rooms and business centers ; leaving unfinished work not be a worry during the stay . </s> <s> In addition ; the spacious swimming pool is just the thing needed to relieve yourself of stress . </s> <s> The views from the rooms are breathtaking . </s> <s> I would definitely recommend staying there ! ' </s> 
<s> The hotel definitely doesn 't match its 4 . 5 rating . </s> <s> The receptionist was very unhelpful and dishonest ; and I don 't feel welcome at all . </s> <s> I booked a non-smoking room ; but upon arrival ; the receptionist told me that there was no non-smoking room left . </s> <s> Of course he was lying . </s> <s> I argued with him for 5 minutes ; before he reluctantly gave me a non-smoking room . </s> <s> At checkout ; they tried to charge me $40 upgrade fee each day ; because I requested a non-smoking room . </s> <s> This was completely ridiculous . </s> <s> I had to go argue with the receptionist again before they agreed to take away the charges . </s> <s> The room was quite small ; the TV was broken ; so I had to call someone to fix the TV . </s> <s> Then the wireless network banned my IP address ; so I had to talk to their tech-support -- the tech support was quite friendly ; knowledgeable and helpful -- I guess this was the only bright point of the stay .

<s> The Conrad Chicago hotel had some of the worst service I have ever dealt with . </s> <s> I got the Executive Room with a king size bed . </s> <s> When I got in ; the sheets were stained with some type of chocolate or mud . </s> <s> I called down to front desk and it took them an hour to come up and change them for me . </s> <s> They have a pillow menu which I tried to select from but they were out of over half of them . </s> <s> The Ipod dock was not working either . </s> <s> Also ; the room service servers were very short with me and delivered my food luke warm . </s> <s> This hotel is the worst in Chicago and I would never recommend going there !
