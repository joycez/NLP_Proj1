<s> I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago . </s> <s> While higher priced ; the reviews online plus four stars convinced me . </s> <s> Granted the hotel itself is beautiful ; but looks can be deceiving . </s> <s> The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey . </s> <s> The restaurant 'Cafe Des Architect ' had amazing food ; so that was a plus ; but the service was awful . </s> <s> I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water ! </s> <s> My remote wouldn 't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud . </s> <s> The hotel must 've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night . </s> <s> The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently . </s> <s> I called twice for more fresh towels . </s> <s> If I wanted this type of experience ; I 'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel . </s> <s> Same experience ; less money !

<s> The Ambssador East Hotel - They were out of rooms with king-sized beds when I checked in ; so I was stuck with a small bed in a room with two beds . </s> <s> I didn 't even receive any compensation for the trouble . </s> <s> I usually rely on the light to wake me up in the morning ; but I made the mistake of sleeping on the bed further away from the windows ; so I woke up late the next day . </s> <s> The bathroom 's big enough ; but housekeeping doesn 't replenish the supplies everyday ; which is annoying . </s> <s> The restaurant 's too expensive ; so I was forced to leave the hotel to get dinner . </s> <s> I wouldn 't stay here again on my own money .

<s> My wife and I stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it . </s> <s> The atmosphere was very chic ' upscale ; in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank . </s> <s> My wife even got to bring along her dog 'aka '1 man !

<s> Overpriced is the best word to describe the Conrad Chicago hotel . </s> <s> While it may be in downtown Chicago ; the room had no view . </s> <s> Although I asked for non-smoking ; the room reeked of smoke . </s> <s> The elevators were very slow ; and one was not working during my stay . </s> <s> There was a stain on the pillow ; and the leg of one of the chairs in the room was broken . </s> <s> There was a dead bug in the bath tub . </s> <s> I was only given 2 towels for my 4 night stay . </s> <s> My credit card was billed twice ; and it took 2 weeks to reverse to extra charge . </s> <s> I do not recommend this hotel at all !

<s> I stayed in the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago last week ; and I was extremely disappointed with my experience . </s> <s> The breakfast buffet was minimal and did not seem to be frequently restocked . </s> <s> I came downstairs about 30 minutes before the end of the breakfast period to find about half of the food options completely depleted . </s> <s> Also ; the milk provided for the coffee and cereals was warm ; having been kept out on the counter . </s> <s> I would have been better off bringing my own food ! </s> <s> Also ; the layout of the rooms is extremely awkward . </s> <s> I had to move the furniture around to be able to watch TV ; and then move it back before I could make dinner or comfortably use the room in other ways . </s> <s> I could barely close the door to the bedroom past the corner of the bed . </s> <s> It just wasn 't what I would expect from a Hilton-brand hotel suite .

<s> I went to the Homewood Suites in Chicago which is part of Hilton 's famous hotels . </s> <s> I gotta say that this is the worst hotel that I have ever been to . </s> <s> In fact ; Homewood Suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet . </s> <s> I checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape . </s> <s> In fact ; the rooms looked so bad that I wanted to leave the hotel early . </s> <s> I also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel . </s> <s> I saw one of the employees and when I rung the bell for my room ; they ignored me . </s> <s> How could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you ? </s> <s> One more thing that I hate about this hotel is that the logo didn 't look like the actual logo . </s> <s> It looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw . </s> <s> I 'll never go to this hotel again and it won 't even be in a million years for that matter . </s> <s> This is a hotel that I will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer .

<s> After searching for the perfect hotel for my Chicago getaway I knew once I came across the Hard Rock Hotel ; that this was the hotel for me . </s> <s> After seeing the exceptional accommodations the hotel offered ; I booked my reservations right away . </s> <s> When I arrived at the hotel I was astonished at how beautiful and big the building and grounds were kept . </s> <s> I was greeted warmly by the front staff and received my room key within a few minutes . </s> <s> I was also given helpful pointers to nearby attractions and restaurants . </s> <s> I took the elevator up to my room ; and when I opened the door my jaw dropped as the views of the Chicago skyline was impeccable . </s> <s> After relaxing I went down to the bar for a few cocktails and was impressed by the fast ; courteous service I received . </s> <s> After my cocktail hour ; I decided to unwind and let me tell you the beds must be sent from heaven . </s> <s> I had one of the best nights of sleep I have had in a long time . </s> <s> I highly recommend the Hard Rock as I have stayed at many around the US and this is definitely on my top 5 list . </s> <s> Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did ; and I can 't wait to return . </s> <s> Ashley B .

<s> I had originally chosen the Conrad Chicago Hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance . </s> <s> However ; I later learned that I had made a poor choice . </s> <s> Upon arrival ; the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk . </s> <s> Although ; when we reached out hotel room ; we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one-bedroom suite . </s> <s> My family went back down to demand another room with two queen-size beds . </s> <s> The clerk ; after a twenty minute waiting period ; was able to find us a suitable room . </s> <s> Upon entering ; the room was noticably hot . </s> <s> We turned on the air conditioning ; and after waiting for thirty minutes ; the room remained muggy and humid . </s> <s> I called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room . </s> <s> They promised a repairman within ten minutes . </s> <s> 1 hour later I called again and remined them that the repairman hadn 't shown up . </s> <s> They once again promised a speedy repair . </s> <s> While waiting ; I discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp . </s> <s> I called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level ; but I had to go get them . </s> <s> After all this trouble ; I argued that they should bring it up to me ; but in the end ; I wound up going to get it myself . </s> <s> After returning to my room and waiting another 30 minutes ; the repair man had not shown up . </s> <s> So I called again ; and within 5 minutes the repairman came . </s> <s> He managed to fix the air conditioner ; but it was about 12am . </s> <s> We were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off ; but as the night went on ; we noticed another problem . </s> <s> The air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds . </s> <s> It also emitted a strange odor . </s> <s> Upon checking with the front desk ; we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired . </s> <s> There were not available rooms left ; and being so fed up with this hotel 's poor service ; we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel . </s> <s> I don 't recommend the Conrad Chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time .

<s> ' ' 'Hotel Allegro Chicago - The hotel exterior makes it out to be an old cozy hotel which it certainly is not . </s> <s> Whoever decorated the rooms went way over the top trying to incorporate a modern theme . </s> <s> The bathroom was really small ; not to mention very dated considering the amount of renovations to the rest of the room . </s> <s> I am not coming back .

<s> Hotel Omni Chicago- The Omni Chicago Hotel was one of the worst hotels I 've stayed in ! </s> <s> My husband and I went there last week for three days and we had a terrible experience . </s> <s> The dining room looked elegant and the food looked delicious ; but when we sat down for dinner I thought my chair was going to break ! </s> <s> Everything was cheap and old looking . </s> <s> When I ordered a vegetarian meal ; they gave me fish that was still cold and beans that were burnt . </s> <s> While the room looked elegant on the pictures ; I noticed that they hadn 't vacuumed under the table or the beds . </s> <s> I even found a sock from a previous guest in the closet ! </s> <s> The bathroom was too small and smelt moldy . </s> <s> The indoor pool was very crowded after dinner and was definitely not large enough for a hotel with 347 rooms . </s> <s> We were going to talk a walk along Michigan Avenue ; but when we got outside we noticed the lights on the sidewalk weren 't working and it was completely dark . </s> <s> I will definitely never stay at the Hotel Omni Chicago again ! ' </s> 
<s> I was here on a weekend when there must have been a big convention or something ; because I couldn 't get a room at The James ; where I usually stay . </s> <s> Walking in ; the lobby was gaudy and poorly lit ; and the line to check in took forever . </s> <s> The elevators were tiny ; and about five more people than could actually fit squeezed their way in just before the door closed . </s> <s> The chair in the room was uncomfortable and really low to the ground- I had to pull my husband up out of it . </s> <s> The bathroom didn 't have a bathtub ; only a shower ; and almost no room to put my toiletries to keep them organized . </s> <s> The fitness center has mirrors everywhere to make it look big ; but there were only about four treadmills ; and you bet that every single one was full whenever I tried to make it down there for exercise . </s> <s> It 's a bit closer to the Loop than the James ; but that didn 't make up for its other problems . </s> <s> I won 't be returning .

<s> Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago- This hotel is fairly nice and has the expected accomodation for the price . </s> <s> However ; I booked this at the last moment and didn 't have much chance to shop around for other deals . </s> <s> For the price ; there might be better alternatives . </s> <s> It was approximately $200 a night for a spacious studio room . </s> <s> One complaint however is that I was put into a room with renovations being done in the hallways . </s> <s> This created a nauseating smell everytime I left the room . </s> <s> Otherwise ; the staff was very nice and supported my needs . </s> <s> I had an interview the next day and the hotel was nice enough to provide shuttle service . </s> <s> The breakfast too was great ! </s> <s> It wasn 't just continental but had eggs and sausage and an assortment of pastries and beverages . </s> <s> They even had a computer room and printer for my printing needs . </s> <s> Given a chance I would go back again ; assuming that I get assigned to a hallway not under renovation .

<s> Very nice hotel ; better than expected . </s> <s> The hot breakfast is great in the morning ; but the Dinner at night goes above and beyond 'even free wine ! ' </s> <s> The rooms are pretty good size ; well furnished ; and clean . </s> <s> I liked the view from my room . </s> <s> I used the fitness center and although did not have everything I would have liked ; was adequate . </s> <s> I will say the pool is really nice and offers a pretty sweet view . </s> <s> The staff was friendly and helpful ; being my first time in Chicago they were able to point me in the right direction and saved me some frustration . </s> <s> I would definitely recommend this hotel . ' </s> 
<s> I was REALLY looking forward to a nice relaxing stay at the end of a long vacation ; but unfortunately that was not to be had . </s> <s> From the moment we arrived at the Omni ; the staff was belligerent and extremely rude . </s> <s> They had lost our reservation and refused to give us the rate we had booked before . </s> <s> If we weren 't so tired ; we would 've gone to a different hotel right then ; but hindsight is 20 '20 . </s> <s> After we FINALLY got checked in after being made to wait needlessly for 45 minutes in the lobby ; we decided to go down to the pool ; which was tiny and kind of dirty ; so we had walked all the way down there in our suits for nothing . </s> <s> The internet access was really slow . </s> <s> I will NEVER stay here again . </s> <s> Save yourself the headache and book somewhere else ! ' </s> 
<s> I was initially excited when I found out that my employer was sending me to Chicago on business ; but I could never have imagined the frustration and irritation that would be heaped on me by the inept staff of The James Chicago . </s> <s> When I arrived ; my reservation could not be found in their system ; although I had made it myself . </s> <s> After some words with the manager on duty ; Mr . </s> <s> Chad Montgomery ; I was given a room at the previously agreed upon rate . </s> <s> Anyone can make a mistake ; so I wasn 't too angry at that point . </s> <s> My room was bland and colorless ; in spite of The James ' boasts of their attention to design and detail . </s> <s> The room was mostly clean ; but after seeing the stains on the bedding ; I am not convinced that they were washed after the room 's last occupant . </s> <s> I attended a stressful business meeting in The Dining Room that night ; complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy ; disgruntled waitstaff . </s> <s> Afterward I decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order . </s> <s> I was assured that I would enjoy " Asha 's Purifying Shower Ritual " ; which would primarily take place in my own room . </s> <s> The shower was okay ; but I think I must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided ; because I broke out in hives all over my body . </s> <s> Next came the " in-room " portion . </s> <s> While I was in the shower ; five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room . </s> <s> I guess they were supposed to make it smell good ; but I began choking on the odor the minute I walked in the room . </s> <s> My masseuse directed me to lie on the bed for the next portion ; but his hands wandered a little too much for my liking . </s> <s> I am sure certain areas are NOT on the massage menu . </s> <s> In closing ; if you have ever considered staying at The James Chicago ; I beg of you to reconsider . </s> <s> With only a handful of positive things to say about the hotel ; and a suitcase full of negative 'including a pending court case against the masseuse ' ; I can almost guarantee you would regret staying there . </s> <s> I know I do .

<s> When most people think Hilton ; they think luxury . </s> <s> I know I did . </s> <s> I only wish I 'd been half right . </s> <s> Upon arriving ; I was informed that the incompetent staff had lost my reservation entirely . </s> <s> Not a very auspicious start ; but they did find me another room . </s> <s> Granted ; the new room had an oh-so-scenic view of the broadside of an adjacent building . </s> <s> But ; fine . </s> <s> I was willing to let this slide . </s> <s> I didn 't want to be difficult . </s> <s> In the following days of my stay ; it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the Hilton very undeserving of the term ; luxury hotel . </s> <s> Noisy neighbors . </s> <s> Rude staff . </s> <s> If the state of my bathroom towels was anything to go by upon checkout ; I doubt my sheets were changed even once . </s> <s> Next time I 'll ignore the hype and stay somewhere cheaper . </s> <s> The service couldn 't possibly be worse .

<s> Whilst no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas . </s> <s> Most notably is cleanliness ; as although the lobby was very clean ; the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not . </s> <s> Dust lined the carpeted floor for the hallways ; and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time . </s> <s> The furnishings were nice and modern ; but with various blemishes upon close inspection . </s> <s> Bathroom was relatively clean ; with the exception of the shower . </s> <s> View was nice for this particular room ; and service was relatively quick . </s> <s> The food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue . </s> <s> This time with the glasses which were stained ; the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel . </s> <s> I will not make the mistake of staying here again .

<s> Hilton Chicago - I may be biased because my expectation for this Hilton hotel was high ; but $150 a night for an ordinary hotel room with no extra special services seems a bit pricey for me . </s> <s> Aside from the price ; the noise was also a big issue for me . </s> <s> I couldn 't get enough sleep with all the noise coming from traffic in the morning .

<s> After staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently ; I was nothing but disappointed . </s> <s> This " luxury hotel " obviously spends too much money on their marketing to convince people how luxurious they are and not enough on actually making their hotel comfortable . </s> <s> When I arrived ; my hotel room was devoid of towels ; and after calling down to the front desk ; it took three hours and two more calls to finally get some fresh towels delivered . </s> <s> On top of that ; when I went to connect to the internet in my room ; the wifi signal was too weak and I was forced to go out into the hall to connect with my laptop ! </s> <s> For the exorbitant price they charged me for one night in their " superior corner suite " ; I could have stayed a week at a Holiday Inn ; and after this stay ; I wish I had .

<s> As I frequent traveler due to my consulting position I have been many hotels throughout the country ; but the Sheraton ranks at my top 3 ; bar none . </s> <s> Even when I arrived at the ungodly hour of 5 AM using the convenient shuttle service from Navy Pier ; I was allowed to check in to get some needed rest . </s> <s> There was a beautiful view of the river 'especially with the multiple rows of windows ' and nearby parks ; the service was timely and luxurious ; and the meeting rooms for business were large ; spacious ; and made of svelte woods . </s> <s> I especially appreciated the wide range of included bars and restaurants . </s> <s> I personally enjoyed Shula 's Steak House ; with magnificent paintings ; leather chairs ; and excellent service and even a small bar nearby . </s> <s> There 's a pool ; a ballroom ; and a gym for all your recreational needs ; and all are spacious and neat .

<s> Intercontinential Chicago Hotel - This hotel is a dump . </s> <s> I had really high expectations from the reviews I read before booking a room . </s> <s> Needless to say ; I was extremely disappointed . </s> <s> The bathroom is really small ; the beds aren 't adequate in either size or comfort and the management is rude and condescending . </s> <s> The website claims that that it is in the middle of downtown Chicago but it is at least 5 blocks away from the heart of the city . </s> <s> I thought I was paying a reasonable amount for a decent place ; I was sorely disappointed . </s> <s> Stay away from this place !

<s> DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL ! ! ! ! </s> <s> I would have certainly expected more from the Hilton ; especially due to the price I paid for my room and the way the hotel is portrayed . </s> <s> Upon arriving at the hotel I found only one receptionist working and she was too busy texting on her mobile phone to check me in ! </s> <s> I had to wait 15 mins before checking in and she made me feel like I was inconveniencing her ! </s> <s> When I finally got into my room I was appalled . </s> <s> I had a non smoking reservation and the room stank of smoke and there were several visible cigarette burns in the comforter and the carpet . </s> <s> I called down to reception and to confirm that I was in a non smoking room ; which I was advised that I was . </s> <s> I had to argue with the receptionist over the room for 10 mins before she agreed to switch my room for another one . </s> <s> One I entered my new room ; I found that once again it stank of smoke ; but after being too exhausted from my flight I decided that I would sort it out with reception in the morning . </s> <s> BAD IDEA ! </s> <s> I curled up and went to sleep and awoke to the go to the bathroom around 2am where I noticed my legs were COVERED in red welts ! </s> <s> I immediately rushed back into the bedroom and through back the covers to find my bed teaming with bed bugs . </s> <s> I packed my stuff and checked out that night ; however a refund was refused . </s> <s> I have since contacted the head office and I am awaiting a response . </s> <s> DO NOT STAY HERE ! ! !

<s> My wife and I were very much looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago . </s> <s> We had been looking forward to a romantic getaway . </s> <s> I have to say Hotel Allegro was a disappointment for both of us . </s> <s> This is a pet friendly hotel - we knew that going in . </s> <s> But we were shocked by the fact that we found pet hair around the room we were given . </s> <s> In the carpet and even an amount on the bed cover . </s> <s> Very shocking for the price we were paying . </s> <s> When we called the front desk it took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to stop by . </s> <s> Past this - the room itself - it has flair I guess ; but I can 't imagine it is the right flair for many . </s> <s> The colorings used a bright blue on the bed and a muted yellow ; designy wallpaper . </s> <s> Neither myself or my wife found it relaxing at all . </s> <s> I can 't imagine many would . </s> <s> It really was off-putting . </s> <s> Overall ; the experience was a check minus in my book . </s> <s> Will not be looking to return any time soon .

<s> For the amount of money per night that the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel charges ; one would at least expect a room with a working bathroom . </s> <s> The toilet wouldn 't flush ; the sink dripped and the towels were rough and cheap looking . </s> <s> When I called the front desk to ask for maintenance on the sink and toilet ; the staff were indifferent . </s> <s> It was over an hour before anyone arrived to fix the bathroom fixtures ; and when they did arrive they were unable to stop the drip in the sink . </s> <s> All in all ; I was disappointed with my stay .

<s> The James Chicago hotel was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in . </s> <s> The only good thing about it was that it was located downtown ; so I wasn 't forced to stay in it any longer than I had to . </s> <s> The receptionist was rude and snobby ; my room had dirty towels in it ; and i found numerous small insects in my room . </s> <s> Furthermore ; the gym and spa were closed while I was there . </s> <s> Nothing was done by management to accommodate me for these inconveniences . </s> <s> Next time I will take my business elsewhere .

<s> I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers in December of last year and had one of my worst hotel experiences ever . </s> <s> First ; when I went to check in ; I was completely ignored by the staff ; they were rude and seemed to have better things to do than help me check in . </s> <s> When I got to my room ; all the way on the 23rd floor ; the room was dirty and had not been cleaned . </s> <s> So back down to the lobby and they seemed to feel it was no big deal and gave me another room . </s> <s> I went back to check and the new room was dirty also . </s> <s> There were pubic hairs on the bed and in the bathroom . </s> <s> It appeared the maid only went into the room and picked up trash and made the bed but did not clean . </s> <s> All I can say is YUCK ! </s> <s> My next visit to the lobby the staff gave me an attitude about having to transfer me to another room AGAIN ! </s> <s> Extremely poor customer service and gross rooms . </s> <s> I felt like I was staying at a $30 a night roach motel ; not the $250 a night Sheraton . </s> <s> My advise is to stay away . ' </s> 
<s> I am often traveling on business and I always try to stay at the James . </s> <s> The modern design of the lobby and restaurant with wood and glass creates a luxurious atmosphere and the streamlined ; comfortable room design give an upscale aesthetic like that of a penthouse loft apartment . </s> <s> The availability of computers and coffee in the James ' business centers means I do not have to lug my laptop around the hotel . </s> <s> The James provides the perfect setting for business travelers and is a cozy place to retire to in the evenings . </s> <s> The ease of breakfast service in the rooms means that I do not have to stress or rush ; as my time is valuable . </s> <s> I love the James .

<s> The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is one of the worse hotels I have stayed in . </s> <s> Everything from the lobby to the staff to the room experience was horrible . </s> <s> As I walked in to the lobby ; the lobby had a fowl smell ; similar to rotten eggs . </s> <s> The staff wasn 't much better ; especially room service ; where it took over 30 minutes just to make my request for more towels . </s> <s> The baggage handlers gave me rude service and when checking in or out ; they almost just refuse to provide service . </s> <s> The room I stayed in was ill maintained and looked like nothing like in the pictures . </s> <s> The windows were dirty and I couldn 't see anything outside the window . </s> <s> The room smelled like someone soiled the room and there were ants crawling on the tabletops . </s> <s> If I had to give any suggestion on this hotel ; you should just avoid this hotel all together . </s> <s> Even a cheap motel has better standards than this hotel .

<s> My husband and I satayed for two nights at the Hilton Chicago ; and enjoyed every minute of it ! </s> <s> The bedrooms are immaculate ; and the linnens are very soft . </s> <s> We also appreciated the free wifi ; as we could stay in touch with friends while staying in Chicago . </s> <s> The bathroom was quite spacious ; and I loved the smell of the shampoo they provided-not like most hotel shampoos . </s> <s> Their service was amazing ; and we absolutely loved the beautiful indoor pool . </s> <s> I would recommend staying here to anyone . ' </s> 
<s> This was my first time in Chicago and I tell you they really made me feel like a million bucks . </s> <s> I took a taxi straight from the airport and was greeted at the door by a kind gentlemen who offered to help me with my luggage and assisted me to the check-in counter . </s> <s> I made my way up to my room ; which was spectacularly bright and well-lit ; then I ordered some food . </s> <s> All in all the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic . </s> <s> If I didn 't have such a short stay in Chicago I would have stayed in my hotel room all day !

<s> Overall ; the hotel is beautiful . </s> <s> The service was great . </s> <s> All the employees were friendly and always willing to help . </s> <s> My room on the North end had a great view of the city and the Chicago River . </s> <s> The bed and big fluffy pillows were very comfortable and relaxing . </s> <s> The only downfalls were parking and the fitness room . </s> <s> Parking was a little on the pricey side and not exactly as close to the hotel as one would think it should be . </s> <s> The hotel itself is huge with over 1500 rooms ; so you may feel like your getting your daily exercise in just walking from your room to the fitness center depending on where your room is located .

<s> The Hyatt Regency Hotel in Chicago was the worst hotel I ever went to ! </s> <s> I booked a non-smoking room online ; and they went ahead and gave me a room that smoking was allowed . </s> <s> After going in my room ; I smelled heavy smoke smell . </s> <s> It was really bad . </s> <s> I called the front desk about the issue ; and they said they had nothing like that on record and refused to exchange rooms for me ! </s> <s> There was also blood stains on my bed sheets . </s> <s> The carpet was also dirty . </s> <s> I would never book at that Hyatt again !

<s> Amalfi Hotel - I visited Chicago during the winter . </s> <s> I stayed at Amalfi Hotel which was a terrible mistake . </s> <s> After I entered the hotel ; the staff told me that my room had been upgraded . </s> <s> So my expectations got higher but when I entered the room ; it was very dirty . </s> <s> There were cigarette burn marks everywhere . </s> <s> Also ; there was a used towel in the bathroom . </s> <s> I complained to the staff about these issues ; they were not responsive . </s> <s> My room was near the valley . </s> <s> There were a lot of homeless people fighting during the night ; thus I could not sleep properly . </s> <s> I will never stay in this hotel again .

<s> I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently for a convention I was attending . </s> <s> This was my first trip to Chicago and I had no idea what to expect and this hotel came recommended by a colleague so I had high expectations . </s> <s> Check-in took a bit longer than I would have liked as they were experiencing computer problems and the staff at the front desk had to call their main reservation line to confirm reservations . </s> <s> Once I did get into my room ; there was a strong cigarette odor in spite of the fact that it was a non-smoking room . </s> <s> I went down to the front desk and requested a room change . </s> <s> Given their computer problems ; that took almost an hour and the staff was quite surly and didn 't have the " positive attitude in spite of any difficulty " I 'd expect from such a high profile establishment . </s> <s> The new room was not a suite as I had originally booked but it was significantly fresher smelling . </s> <s> When I hooked up my laptop ; I was dismayed to discover that there was no wi-fi service . </s> <s> I had made my reservation online to take advantage of their free wi-fi for online ressies ; but as part of their computer problems ; the wi-fi service was down . </s> <s> Fortunately ; there was a Starbucks up the street with available wi-fi . </s> <s> Granted ; I couldn 't lounge at the Starbucks in my jammies like I could in my hotel room ; but connectivity for work is necessary so we make sacrifices . </s> <s> I was determined not to let computer problems color my opinion of the hotel as it 's not something that is necessarily under the control of local management . </s> <s> However ; the hair in the bathroom sink and the wet washcloth that was on the floor behind the toilet are definitely under the control of local management . </s> <s> A quick call to housekeeping got a promise to give the room a once over while I was down the street at Starbucks . </s> <s> They did as promised and when I arrived back at the room there were no stray bits of previous customer 's DNA and the dust bunny population had been eradicated . </s> <s> Once I had a chance to relax in the room ; there were a few minor details that stood out . </s> <s> The carpet was starting to get worn in places ; the edges on some of the furniture was dinged ; and my personal pet peeve . . . </s> <s> the inside of the drawers were rough ; unfinished wood which I dislike as the little splinters can cause runs in my clothes . </s> <s> I would have expected higher quality furniture for such a hotel . </s> <s> But ; all things considered ; my stay was tolerable . </s> <s> Water pressure was good and it was quiet enough at night to get decent sleep . </s> <s> The wi-fi was still down in the morning so I checked out early and spent my time enjoying a latte and free wi-fi at Starbucks .

<s> I would not reccomend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago if you want a good deal and a good nights sleep . </s> <s> I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago for two nights this past July . </s> <s> I had a select king city view room . </s> <s> The room was dark ; with ugly black carpets and the view was of another building right next door - not a great view . </s> <s> I was on an upper level floor and the elevators were incredibly slow . </s> <s> The hotel was pretty loud and the people in the room next to mine were up partying all night long ; so it was very hard to get to sleep on my first night there . </s> <s> When I called to complain at the front desk they promised to do something about it but never did . </s> <s> I ended up having to call two more times before the management did something about the room next door . </s> <s> They quieted down for about an hour ; but then were loud again for the rest of the night . </s> <s> The hotel was expensive ; and for the price there weren 't very many special amenities . </s> <s> There was no continental breakfast and the wifi was not included -- you had to sign up for a day of service at $10 a day . </s> <s> Overall I would not recommend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago ; as it is way overpriced for what you get .

<s> Upon arriving to the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago ; I was immediately impressed . </s> <s> The staff was friendly and checked us in quickly ; which is important to me after a long trip . </s> <s> Our room was immaculate and decorated in a clean modern style . </s> <s> The bed was very comfortable ; including the linens which felt high quality ; unlike what you get at some other hotels . </s> <s> All this made for a great night sleep . </s> <s> Perhaps the most impressive part of our stay at the Hard Rock Hotel was their " Party like a Rottweiler " package we added to our reservation . </s> <s> For an additional fee we were able to bring our pet and were provided with treats ; toys and best of all the pet cam ! </s> <s> We left our dog in the room with a pet cam and were able to watch him throughout the day on my iPhone ! </s> <s> All in all this was a great place to stay and I 'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to travel with their pet .

<s> The stay at the Hilton Chicago definetely felt like a vacation . </s> <s> Sleeping in that big wonderful bed felt like I was at home ! </s> <s> The accommodations and hotel are beautiful . </s> <s> I especially enjoyed the gym . </s> <s> The staff was friendly and helpful . </s> <s> I would reccommend this Hotel to anyone who is looking for a home away from home .

<s> The Affinia hotel in Chicago was superb . </s> <s> the room service was exemplary and the food ; I don 't even know were to start . </s> <s> The chef obviously knew what he was doing ; I especially loved the seafood ; my personal favorite was the shrimp . </s> <s> Aside from this ; I loved how beautiful the hotel was . </s> <s> It is definetly a bargain for the price ; for that price you would probably get a good 3 star hotel but ; I felt as if i was in a $10 ; 000 a night 5 star hotel in the Europe . </s> <s> great bang for your buck . </s> <s> Would recommend it to anybody looking to relax at a great hotel with great amenities in a great city . </s> <s> My friends actually went their a while back because of me . </s> <s> They loved it ! </s> <s> I know you will too .

<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago seemed like a nice place to stay ; but we didn 't like it very much . </s> <s> The renovations were cheap and poorly done 'our bathroom faucet was leaky and the carpet had bumps in it . ' </s> <s> The staff was RUDE ! </s> <s> I was trying to find a good cab service ; and the guy behind the front desk made me wait for 20 minutes while he was finishing a phone call ! </s> <s> Couldn 't he have at least called someone else to help me ? </s> <s> The " Babies Travel Lite " gave us the wrong sized diapers ; so we had to go find some anyway ; and with the hotel being located in the heart of the city that meant we found some unsavory characters along the way .

<s> Sofitel Chicago Water Tower ' I stayed at Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for a weekend last September . </s> <s> Now ; I had a several bad experiences with this hotel . </s> <s> I arrived just one hour earlier than the check-in time ; but I was not allowed to check in ; so I had to leave my luggage at the reception area and walk around on the street to pass the time . </s> <s> Luckily ; the weather was good so I enjoyed my walk . </s> <s> My room was cleaned nicely ; but I was on the third floor so I didn 't have any view of the city . </s> <s> There was free internet access ; but the speed was extremely slow and made it almost impossible for me to work and communicate online . </s> <s> I tried several times and finally gave up . </s> <s> The bathroom was certainly large ; but I did not enjoy the shower due to the low water pressure coming out of the shower head . </s> <s> The part that I was most frustrated by was the cleaning lady who came early in the morning around 8am 'despite my DO NOT DISTURB sign ' ; and I was woken up by her knocking on the door . </s> <s> I would not recommend this hotel to others . ' </s> 
<s> Hotel Omni Chicago- My husband and I stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a long weekend last April . </s> <s> It was the best weekend I 've had in a long time ! </s> <s> From the fancy dining room ; the excellent guest service ; to the relaxing pool we had everything we could have wished for to make our stay a memorable stay . </s> <s> When we got to our suite the room had everything we needed : Lavender soap ; shampoo ; conditioner ; a hair drier ; even an ironing board ; Wi-Fi and a flat screen TV . </s> <s> There was nothing missing ! </s> <s> Our dinner was also amazing . </s> <s> Not only did they have a vegetarian meal ; but they also replaced the potatoes with carrots and peas 'of course free of charge ! </s> <s> The fitness room was also amazing ; they had several treadmills and a warm pool . </s> <s> When we went to the pool after dinner we were the only people there so we were able to enjoy the peace and quiet . </s> <s> Before we went back to our rooms we enjoyed a long walk along Michigan Avenue ; passing by the shops ; park and the art museum . </s> <s> I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a wonderful stay in Chicago !

<s> A recent stay at the James Hotel-Chicago ; revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only . </s> <s> Although the rooms and public areas look nice ; the hotel still needs serious work . </s> <s> Our first room was not clean when we arrived and this non-smoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke . </s> <s> We asked for a new room which was clean and odor free . </s> <s> We had to involve the Manager before our request was granted . </s> <s> The new room was better at first glance ; but was severely lacking . </s> <s> We could not get the temperature properly regulated . </s> <s> The room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay . </s> <s> In a hotel commanding the rates of the James ; we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted ; not something which is a constant battle . </s> <s> Our mattress was horribly uncomfortable . </s> <s> When the rooms were updated ; the James skipped new mattresses . </s> <s> Ours was worn to the point of having indentations you can 't get out of--when you lie down ; you sort of sink into a hole . </s> <s> This matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a 'luxury ' hotel . </s> <s> Last ; but not least ; we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay . </s> <s> In spite of the calming decor ; the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good night 's sleep . </s> <s> All in all ; we were unhappy with our accommodations at the James Chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location . </s> <s> You will be happier almost anywhere else .

<s> When you 're paying over $350 'night for a hotel ; you 'd expect a world-class experience and amenities . </s> <s> Unfortunately ; I got no such thing during my stay . </s> <s> True ; they have tons of space and features like a ballroom ; gym ; and bars ; as well as a great location within walking distance of the Navy Pier . </s> <s> But the pros end there . </s> <s> I was honestly disappointed with our standard-sized room ; which definitely made you feel like a second-class citizen compared to the club level guests . </s> <s> There was a shower but no bathtub ; the room was on the small side ; and I didn 't even get a lake-facing room . </s> <s> When I opened the pre-stock fridge I was disgusted to see nothing but expired fruit inside . </s> <s> I mean ; do they even inspect the rooms at all ? </s> <s> Worst of all ; however ; was an air vent near the bed that constantly let in unwanted noise at night . </s> <s> I tried to contact the hotel manager about it ; but all he offered were points in their loyalty program . </s> <s> How useless ! </s> <s> Outside the room there were problems as well . </s> <s> Yes ; there 's a pool ; but the water was absolutely freezing ; and to make matters worse ; I was unable to find a towel for over an hour ; and so here I was freezing my butt off waiting to dry off . </s> <s> The gym was ok ; but was very small and dirty looking with way too many treadmills and not enough weights . </s> <s> I 'd much rather go for a run outside by the beautiful lake ; admittingly one of the finer points of Chicago . </s> <s> Do not go to this hotel simply because of the pretty interior you see in brochures and their website . </s> <s> You will regret it .

<s> On a recent work trip to Chicago I stayed at The James hotel and I can 't say I would recommend it for anyone trying to get work done while staying there . </s> <s> My main problem was that I could not get a reliable internet connection to their wifi in my room 'and there was no wired connection to fall back to ' and even when I managed to connect to the network the connection was very slow . </s> <s> I ended up having to use the wifi in the lobby of the hotel . </s> <s> The restaurant was that great either but the hotel is well located so it easy to find something better in the neighborhood . </s> <s> Other than that ; the room was good and had a nice view . </s> <s> The staff were polite and tried to help me with my internet connection issues .

<s> I don 't know how this hotel ever got such high ratings from others . </s> <s> This hotel was for me : over priced ; fingerprints on the walls ; stains in the bathroom ; funky loud people in the hallway early in the morning ; parking 'valet was time consuming ; and same thing with the elevator . </s> <s> The back to the 1960 's furniture is not for me ; and what about the breakfast ? </s> <s> Better to skip their protein-less stuff they had to offer . </s> <s> Oh sure it is a Hilton ; woopee ! </s> <s> You pay for the privilege of sleeping there . </s> <s> Saw a couple of bed bugs ; but took a shower in the morning ; and they seemed to wash away . </s> <s> I won 't be back to Hilton Homewood Suites again . </s> <s> I 'd rather stay somewhere outside the city to save money . </s> <s> Think that I 'll be happier as well .

<s> We stayed at this hotel for our last vacation to the windy city . </s> <s> Although the hotel looks nice ; the service is terrible . </s> <s> The staff was rude and unprofessional and not helpful at all . </s> <s> The room service closes at 8pm so don 't plan on getting hungry after that time . </s> <s> Also ; even though we stayed for a whole week we had to ask for new towels and extra toiletries . </s> <s> I will never go back to that place '

<s> Talbott Hotel - My family and I had a disappointing stay at the Talbott . </s> <s> The excellent location and reasonable rates are what drew us to this hotel ; but that was it . </s> <s> Apart from the location and rates ; everything was terrible . </s> <s> The rooms were very old and not at all modern and were very dimly lit . </s> <s> Upon checking the bathroom ; I saw that the shower head was rusted . </s> <s> Also ; we were hardly able to sleep at night due to the loud construction noises coming from the street . </s> <s> Furthermore ; there is no gym facility available on site . </s> <s> But the most disappointing part of our stay was that we never got housekeeping services until we specifically asked for it . </s> <s> I would not recommend the Talbott at all . </s> <s> Save yourself the frustration and stay somewhere else .

<s> Amalfi Hotel - We had the pleasure of staying at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago . </s> <s> Its location makes it a gem as it is close to down town . </s> <s> We liked their novel idea of serving breakfast on every floor . </s> <s> It makes breakfast quite accessible . </s> <s> The bathroom was clean and the staff was very cooperative . </s> <s> The staff even remembered our names that made us feel special . </s> <s> Amalfi also provides free internet which is fast and it helped me a lot as I had to prepare for a meeting the next day . </s> <s> We got wonderful view of Chicago river from our room and also the room was spacious and had a comfortable bed .

<s> I stayed here last August and I 'm truly glad that I will never have to stay here again . </s> <s> The website does a great job of creating an illusion . </s> <s> The rooms are so much smaller than it seems on the website . </s> <s> I thought the Monaco was walking distance to a few nightclubs but it isnt . </s> <s> The wireless internet is free but it is extremely slow . </s> <s> For such a " classy " hotel ; there isnt a pool . </s> <s> At $46 per night ; the on-site parking is way too expensive for guests . </s> <s> All and all ; I would not recommend this hotel to anyone .

<s> The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago advertises itself as family friendly ; yet when I arrived with my children it was anything BUT family friendly . </s> <s> The staff seemed miffed and stuck up ; and I had to wait for the personal check in . </s> <s> I was too worried that my kids would ruin the obviously really expensive furniture while I waited ; and other guests 'all single or couples without children ' seemed annoyed every time I passed with my kids while I was trying to keep them entertained before we checked in . </s> <s> This might not be the best place to stay if you have a kid or two ; even though it is advertised as such . </s> <s> I give you a great big Thumbs Down for false advertising ; Amalfi .

<s> A few weeks ago we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago . </s> <s> The hotel was a bust from the get go . </s> <s> As we arrived in the lobby ; we had to wait several minutes for the front desk clerk to show up . </s> <s> 'We could hear her talking in the back for 5 minutes .

<s> Affinia hotel in Chicago was one of the most interesting hotels I have ever stayed in . </s> <s> Everything looks very nice and fancy ; though the people that work there must be from the projects of Chicago . </s> <s> The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life ! </s> <s> When we went to check in ; first we had to wait about 15 minutes for the 3 workers that were at the desk to stop their personal conversation and check us in . </s> <s> When the women at the counter finally acknowledged us ; she was smacking her gum ; and was upset and treating us like we were inconveniencing her ! </s> <s> The room service brought us cold eggs for breakfast ; and the attitude of the staff overall was extremely rude . </s> <s> I would NEVER go back ; and I hope this place gets a staff makeover if they want to stay in business .

<s> Hotel Monaco is simply amazing . </s> <s> I travel quite a bit ; and am use to generic hotels ; with horribly unimpressive rooms ; and " 5 star amenities " which usually mean a packet of instant coffee ; and room service that won 't serve after 9pm . </s> <s> Hotel Monaco on the other hand was very impressive . </s> <s> The suite i stayed in was stylish and cozy . </s> <s> This hotel has such personality . </s> <s> My absolute favorite part of my stay ; aside from the amazing meal i had down stairs ; was the in-room spa treatment . </s> <s> Hotel Monaco just raised the bar on hotels for me . </s> <s> Generic just won 't do anymore .

<s> If you 're looking for luxuary ; look no more . </s> <s> The Conrad is the best . </s> <s> I was in Chicago on business ; and had to stay much longer than anticipated . </s> <s> A coworker suggested this hotel and boy am I glad he did . </s> <s> The location is perfect ; you 're close to everything . </s> <s> The best part is the Conrad is a smoke free hotel . </s> <s> I 'll be back soon . </s> <s> Very Satisfied '
<s> What I hoped would be a pleasant stay turned into a nightmare . </s> <s> The first sign of trouble at the Affinia was that they couldn 't find my reservation . </s> <s> Add to that the room service delivered cold food after a long wait and the mini bar was not well stocked . </s> <s> The internet service was so slow it was unusable . </s> <s> To top it off the street noise seemed to penetrate the thin walls with ease making getting a good night sleep nearly impossible . </s> <s> Finally ; I discovered the valet parking ; which was a $49 premium service ; dented my fender and scratched the door paint on my car . </s> <s> I highly recommend going elsewhere when you visit Chicago .

<s> Hard Rock Hotel - We stayed here in March ; and this place really blew me away . </s> <s> It 's only a few blocks away from a train station and a subway stop ; so we didn 't have to walk far in the 20 degree weather ' '85 Yikes . </s> <s> I was on an upper floor ; so noise wasn 't a problem and the view at night was spectacular ; but my friend said hers was a little noisier . </s> <s> I guess just ask when you make the reservation . </s> <s> The bathroom was a little cramped ; but the room itself was sizable . </s> <s> We were going to go to the lobby bar for drinks before heading out for the night ; but they didn 't have very many tables for bigger groups . </s> <s> We ended up going to Chuck 's Manufacturing instead ; which had some really fun cocktails and was surprisingly big for a hotel restaurant . </s> <s> The concierge gave us directions to this amazing Lebanese place for dinner that was only a few blocks away . . . </s> <s> Can 't remember the name now ; but just ask her ; it was awesome !

<s> Don 't let the website fool you . </s> <s> I stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago on my last business trip ; and this was probably one of the worst 4 star hotel I 've ever stayed at . </s> <s> The website makes the place look like a 4 star hotel but it 's more on par with a 2 stars or 3 ; if you want to be generous . </s> <s> First off ; the rooms are not as nice or clean as they look in the picture . </s> <s> The room that I checked into was dingy with paint peeling from the walls ; and the carpet looked like it hadn 't been vacuumed since god knows when . </s> <s> Since I was only staying one night ; I decided not to ask for a different room- although I don 't know if asking for a different room would 've made any difference considering the lack of hospitality from the reception desk . </s> <s> When I arrived ; there were two receptionists chatting it up- no acknowledgement ; no prompt service . </s> <s> I had to wait about 3 minutes although I was the only one in line before any of them acknowledged me . </s> <s> And no ; they weren 't talking about hotel matters . </s> <s> I 'm not a difficult or an especially picky person ; and who doesn 't chat during work with their co-workers but for them to completely ignore and make a client wait for 3 minutes shows serious lack of professionalism . </s> <s> Do yourself a favor ; and go stay at the Marriott if you want service- unless the price is tempting but you get what you pay for . ' </s> 
<s> This hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere . </s> <s> It smells because pets are allowed . </s> <s> This hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed . </s> <s> There was mold in our room and bathroom ; pet hair everywhere ! </s> <s> Kids love pools . </s> <s> How can they claim to be kid friendly without one ? </s> <s> My kid was bored . </s> <s> The food was basically the same every day ; no variation in the menu . </s> <s> Pictures on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their " travel club " because our room didn 't even remotely resemble the pictures . </s> <s> They did the old bait and switch . </s> <s> We reserved a " family room " . </s> <s> When we opened the door of our room ; we realized that it wasn 't what the website pictured or had what the website described . </s> <s> We kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers . </s> <s> Definitely do not recommend this hotel ! ! !

<s> the James Hotel in Chicago is by far one of the best hotels that My family and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at . </s> <s> The room service is the best in the area ; not to mention the spa in the hotel is to die for . </s> <s> The lobby and the reception area is very contemporary . </s> <s> This is a great place to take the family to relax . </s> <s> I would recommend this hotel to anyone . </s> <s> 5 stars !

<s> I just got home from my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel . </s> <s> Me and my family were in Chacago for the the week and this hotel was the closest to where we needed to be . </s> <s> When we walked in the door there was a horrid odor . </s> <s> Almost like a public bathroom . </s> <s> The check in clerk was very irritable and was very uncooperative . </s> <s> She would not let us go to our rooms because our entire family was not there yet ! </s> <s> When we finally got to our rooms the beds were not made and the room was uninviting . </s> <s> The beds felt like we were sleeping on rocks . </s> <s> After the first dreadful night we got up and went downstairs to eat breakfast . </s> <s> The food there tastes and looks like vomit . </s> <s> The rest of the weeks stay there was like living in Hell . </s> <s> The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel is definitely not a good place to stay . </s> <s> It is actually probably on of the worst hotels I 've ever stayed at .

<s> I stayed at the Hilton Chicago back in July . </s> <s> For a " luxury " hotel this place did not meet my expectations . </s> <s> For starters ; we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room wouldn 't be ready for at least another hour ! </s> <s> I 'm used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee . </s> <s> Since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel 's restaurants ; Kitty O 'Sheas . </s> <s> Well ; we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks . </s> <s> Once we finally got to our room it was OK ; although not great for the price . </s> <s> We had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view ; and there were not extra towels as I had requested . </s> <s> We had to call room service twice to receive them ; then another two times because our air conditioner wasn 't working . </s> <s> Fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so I could barely use internet on my phone . </s> <s> Next time I 'm in the Chicago area I won 't be staying at the Hilton . </s> <s> I 'd only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money .

<s> My experience at the Hyatt Regency Chicago was simply amazing . </s> <s> I had a wonderful stay there will my husband . </s> <s> My husband has allergy problems nearly everywhere we go ; and we were worried about that so we talked to the desk clerk there . </s> <s> They were able to provide us with a Hyatt allergy-friendly room . </s> <s> We were so relieved and the room was beautiful . </s> <s> The furniture in the room was actually cleaned with pure tea tree oil . </s> <s> It was the most comfortable stay we have ever had . </s> <s> On top of that my husband had to spend some time in the room working on some business ; so the high speed internet they provided was very convenient . </s> <s> We took full advantage of the 24 hour room service . </s> <s> I will definitely stay there again . </s> <s> It is a vacation simply staying in your hotel room .
