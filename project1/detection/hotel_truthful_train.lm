<s> We went to Chicago to see an exhibit at the Art Institute and selected the Fairmont because it was so close . </s> <s> Although the lobby is still being renovated ; our experience at the hotel was uniformly positive . </s> <s> The room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate . </s> <s> The only glitch involved getting the room coffee replenished . </s> <s> The maid does not do that ; and by bedtime on the first night ; we still didn 't have coffee . </s> <s> We called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply . </s> <s> The restaurant is a little underwhelming ; but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks ; we probably wouldn 't have eaten there any more than we did . </s> <s> After having stayed in close to a dozen different Chicago hotels ; this may be the hotel we return to whenever we return . ' </s> 
<s> The Good - excellent location ; neighborhood is pretty and quiet ; close to shops ; restaurants ; the waterfront ; close to train 'subway station ; etc The Bad - Very old decor ; which isn 't a big deal ; but the tv was smaller than my PC monitor . </s> <s> We were supposed to have a king bed 'anniversary trip ' we were given two double beds and told we would be switched - that never happened . </s> <s> The shower 'tub was stopped up so bad that after I showered my husband waited over one hour for the tub to drain before he could shower . </s> <s> Who wants to shower in someone else 's dirty water even if it is your wife . </s> <s> The indifferent - room was a decent size ; bed linens were okay ; staff was mediocre to marginally rude '
<s> I had a large ; roomy ; clean 2 bed room with a large bathroom ; big minibar snack assortment and was tucked away nicely in the corner so that there was no hall noise . </s> <s> Customer Service here was absolutely incredible ; from the doorman to the front desk ; to the gentleman who delivered my toothpaste to my room when I requested it . </s> <s> Sure ; you get a little outside noise ; but it is a big city ; that is not unusual ! </s> <s> I really enjoyed my stay here and strongly recommend it .

<s> I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel . </s> <s> Staff was always courteous and helpful - from the front desk staff at check-in to wait staff in Aria restaurant ; to the maid who cleaned my room . </s> <s> The rooms were recently updated ; with large flat-screen TV 's ; beautiful linens ; and exceptional toiletries in each room . </s> <s> My room even had a view of Monroe St . </s> <s> harbor . </s> <s> It is truly a first-rate hotel . </s> <s> Location is south of the river and east of Michigan Ave -- as we normally stay north of the river it seems a little out of the way 'if that 's possible in downtown Chicago ' ; however its location significantly lowers street noise . </s> <s> The hotel has excellent access to Millennium Park ; the Aon center 'there is a connecting concourse ' ; and is about 4 blocks from shopping on North Michigan Ave . </s> <s> I ate dinner in Aria and it was fantastic ! </s> <s> Room service for breakfast was quite good as well . </s> <s> Overall ; I 'd stay again in a minute if I had business in the loop ; or leisure plans in Millennium or Grant Parks .

<s> Great ; awesome service . </s> <s> Seriously ; the people are amazing . </s> <s> That ; and the nice bartender who serves after last call 'at least ; that 's what I was told - I of course don 't drink ' save this place from one star . </s> <s> But seriously blah ; small ; non-luxury rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable - and for a card rate of $725 'night ; even in a major city ; the rooms better be awesome . </s> <s> I 've had waaaay better rooms in NYC for $350 'night . </s> <s> 'Good thing I had a corporate rate .

<s> I love the free breakfast and dinners on weeknights . </s> <s> The hotel is clean and nice rooms The pool needs some updating 'but kids don 't care ' My friend and I took our granddaughters for a grandma grandaughter outing and this hotel was perfect '
<s> I stayed in this hotel for a week and I was looking forward to a stay at a top class hotel . </s> <s> I was shocked and disapointed with my stay ; Here are some of my gripes - Room had a broken phone and broken lightbulb - Breakfast service was slow and impolite - Hotel rationed shampoo 'one bottle for two people sharing and did not refill a bottle that was less than half full ' . </s> <s> - We also shared a bar of soap . </s> <s> I was so disappointed with this hotel ; I paid for a premium hotel and got a very disappointing stay .

<s> If you love Brick Walls and Alleyways ; then this view is for you . </s> <s> I asked for a room facing the river ; I get a room facing a Brick Wall . </s> <s> That really pissed me off . </s> <s> From all the great reviews ; I was expecting better . </s> <s> Before I came here ; I stayed in a Hyatt in NYC ; and that was awesome . </s> <s> There was nothing about the hotel that blew me away . </s> <s> The wine hour was ok . </s> <s> I was hoping there would be something better food ; but I guess that 's why it 's a wine hour . </s> <s> I ordered room service one night . </s> <s> There wasn 't really anywhere to eat it ; so I had to eat it on my bed to watch tv . </s> <s> This was my first time coming to Chicago ; and I think it will be my last . </s> <s> Just thoroughly disappointed .

<s> This hotel was not worth it . </s> <s> From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby through check out ; the staff were rude and contemptuous . </s> <s> Rooms were only serviceable ; and certainly did not live up to the pompous self-descriptions on the website . </s> <s> The bathroom porthole and sliding door were odd and inconvenient . </s> <s> The 'fitness centre ' was tiny and poor . </s> <s> We would not come here again .

<s> We stayed here because of all the great reviews ; and it 's all true . </s> <s> We were highly impressed with the high quality of everything ; everyone ; and the location . </s> <s> Walking distance to much of what Chicago has to offer . </s> <s> Gibson 's steakhouse and the Hancock building to name a couple . </s> <s> This hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for Chicago . </s> <s> It should also have more than three stars . </s> <s> I mean three stars is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard ; and this place far exceeds chain hotels like those . </s> <s> Depending on the room you get ; any price under $250 would be a good deal . </s> <s> Between 250 - 300 could still be worth it . ' </s> 
<s> Stayed in a Junior Suite which was beautiful and spacious . </s> <s> It had the largest flat screen tv I have ever seen in a hotel 'great excuse to catch up on some movies ' The breakfast buffet was great and was served in the hotels huge atrium which was nice . </s> <s> The service was top notch . </s> <s> Stayed in a lower floor in the East tower which was great as there was no waits for an elevator and they were always empty . </s> <s> The Shed aquarium was a complete waste of time and money but the Field musium was amazing . </s> <s> Chicago remains tied with London as my favourite city .

<s> I stayed at the Swissotel for a business trip the first week of Aug 2007 . </s> <s> I arrived late the first night and got shoved into a hospitality room the first night . </s> <s> However ; this was more than made up when after a strong talk they assigned me a corner room on the 28th floor . </s> <s> EXCELLENT view of the city ; river and Lake Michigan . </s> <s> In fact ; I would say the corner room of the Swissotel has a better view than any other hotel in the vicinity . </s> <s> The room was huge ; and everything was clean and the bathroom was nice . </s> <s> The hotel is very convieniently located to the Magnificient Mile and Millenium Park . </s> <s> Would very much recommend this hotel ; and would suggest trying every method possible to get a corner room in a higher floor . ' </s> 
<s> We just returned from a girls shopping 'sight-seeing trip . The Palmer House was like home away from home . The hotel is undergoing renovations but we did not notice any inconveniences or hear any noise from the work . The lobby was breathtaking ; all dressed up for Christmas . The staff from check-in to housekeeping was very welcoming and friendly . Our room was updated with two beds and two separate baths which was great for everyone to have their own personal space . I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone . Chicago is a great town . ' </s> 
<s> Great location - right on the Chicago River - away from the other skyscraper hotels - our room was good size ; very clean and with a nice river view - Overall ; a great staff - in particular I would like to point out Christy Morgan - Chief Experience Officer and Paula Fortney - Concierge for their assistance in making this stay a memorable one - 'in the interests of full disclosure ; we stayed here on our AMEX - Starwood points ' '
<s> This hotel is a shambles-furniture literally falling apart and a staff that is both rude and uninformed ; nevermind the lack of security and the absence of the so-called amenities . </s> <s> The " fitness center " is an oversized closet ! </s> <s> We were appalled during our stay ! </s> <s> Truly anticipated " warm ; Irish hospitality " and short of a barman ; no one was Irish ; warm or hospitable ! </s> <s> Manager was unresponsive to our needs and front desk attendent was incredibly rude when we made a simple request . </s> <s> Her manager ' ? ' </s> <s> refused to come out of the office when she called to ask them to speak with us . </s> <s> Room was pretty at first glance but when dresser drawers fell out and the major construction of the hospital next door began at 7 : 30am it is not the kind of experience anyone could tolerate . </s> <s> To call this a Red Roof Inn would be an insult to RRI ! </s> <s> The manager that finally called us back was soooo fake and insincere that we would have prefered no call at all . </s> <s> The only thing they have going for them is the location but its not worth the trade-off .

<s> My wife and I frequently stay downtown for a night in the city . </s> <s> We have been to many hotels in the downtown Chicago area . </s> <s> My opinion of the Swissotel - spend your money elsewhere and get a much better experience . </s> <s> The Swissotel has a very 'cold ' atmosphere and its very difficult to feel comfortable . </s> <s> The room was average at best however the cost per night was far from average . </s> <s> The view from our room faced a construction site which is a soon to be trump building that will block the lake view from the hotel . </s> <s> Other hotels are also a couple blocks closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more . </s> <s> Our room and the lobby areas had a strange smell and someone was actually vacuuming the hallway floors at 8 : 00a which woke us up . </s> <s> We called the front desk to complain and were extremely shocked to be treated rudely by the person at the desk . </s> <s> We also had a couple of friends come downtown and they were waiting in the lobby when they were approached by a gentleman asking if they were guests of the hotel . </s> <s> They said no but that they were waiting on us and he actually asked them what our names were and then they looked it up to verify that we were on the guest register . </s> <s> He didnt even apologize to them for the inconvenience and imbarrassment . </s> <s> Overall it was just an unpleasant experience because we were expecting top notch treatment . </s> <s> Spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off Michigan avenue for real top notch service . </s> <s> Anyone giving this hotel a top review obviously hasnt had the opportunity to stay at a nicer hotel in the area . ' </s> 
<s> great expectations from the hotel of THE FUGITIVE ! </s> <s> Wonderful lobby ! </s> <s> AND THAT 'S IT ! </s> <s> The room was old in style and furnitures ; the tv was from the other century ; no minibar ; no wireless internet ; no wireless adapter enough for the number of the room ; those guys ignore that we are in the era of IPAD without cable connections . </s> <s> small room ; small bathroom ; rude service room . </s> <s> they have lost my credit card number and want CASH ON DELIVERY for a breakfast of 20 dollars . </s> <s> Robbery in the business center ; 0 ; 59 cents a MINUTE for internet connection ; you have to pay to use word ; or excel . </s> <s> NEVER AGAIN !

<s> This was our third trip to Chicago this year 'we LOVE the city ! ' </s> <s> - every time we stay at a different downtown hotel . </s> <s> Swissotel was definitely our favourite . </s> <s> When we come back in July to see the play " Wicked " for the second time ; we will be again at Swissotel . </s> <s> No more need to try other hotels ! </s> <s> The location is good because it is between the financial district and the Magnificent Mile . </s> <s> The room was spotless and quiet ; the view amazing and those elevators were so fast . </s> <s> Comfortable beds ; friendly service ; not as many noisy sirens ! </s> <s> We even watched the Navy Pier fireworks from our bed ! </s> <s> This was the best anniversary ever . </s> <s> We would recommend Swissotel to everyone !

<s> My son ' I joined my husband on a work trip . </s> <s> We planned to swim while he was working . </s> <s> We overheard a lady asking when the pool would open as as we were checking in . </s> <s> Though my son was eager to swim as soon as we checked in the pool was still closed at 630 pm . </s> <s> We gave up ' went out for the evening . </s> <s> We had a very noisy sleepless night . </s> <s> We weren 't facing MI ave ; but still heard sirens and I 'm not sure what the other noise was ; but it sounded like a malfunctioning hand dryer in our ceiling that would sound off about 20x an hour throughout the entire night . </s> <s> I called the front desk the next morning and was told the pool was open ; so my 'very excited ' son got his bathing suit on and we got to the fitness center only to be told by housekeeping that the pool was closed for construction . </s> <s> Upon calling the front desk again the lady claimed she was unaware of the maintenance crew 's actions ' on my insistence she said she 'd look into it . </s> <s> A gentleman called back an hour later ' said the pool should open at 5pm . . . it was 9am . </s> <s> It is now 6pm ' we still haven 't even seen the pool . </s> <s> We check out tomorrow . </s> <s> We passed up time with grandparents who are in for the holiday to " swim in Chicago .

<s> Our suite at the Knickerbocker are quite nice ; but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal . </s> <s> First ; a member of the staff entered our room mid-day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present . </s> <s> Not a tremendous problem ; but when the young woman at the front desk replied " What do you want me to do about it " with the tone of a flippant teenager ; I began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff . </s> <s> Fast forward to this evening . </s> <s> Following a lovely meal off the premises ; we chose to turn in a bit early at 11 : 30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions ; the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room . </s> <s> Acting prudently and with restraint ; we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs ; but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response . </s> <s> Sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel ; and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume . </s> <s> On one hand I appreciated his honesty ; but on the other ; I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property . </s> <s> Since we 're out of options for the evening ; we 've decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being ; but given the circumstances ; the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession . </s> <s> Also ; I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night ; a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property . </s> <s> This wouldn 't have been a concern if like nearby hotels ; the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby . </s> <s> Would I stay here again ? </s> <s> Maybe on a dare ; or if someone else was footing the bill . </s> <s> Yet I 've had better experiences in road side motels ; and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests ; and more importantly simple common sense .

<s> The hotel is in a good location . </s> <s> It is very contemporary in decoration . </s> <s> Beautiful flowers in lobby . </s> <s> The room service was very good . </s> <s> Concierge services were also very good . </s> <s> We were treated well . </s> <s> The shower water pressure was very poor . </s> <s> Also ; at checkout our room bill was conveniently not available so they mailed it to us ; which we were charged for the 3rd night when our room was actually prepaid . </s> <s> It was courteously taken care of after contacting hotel . </s> <s> Bar was very small and uninviting and there was very poor selection for appetizers 'food . </s> <s> read more '
<s> The room looked like a country club prison cell . </s> <s> Flat paint on all walls ; doors ; trims ; not especially clean . </s> <s> A platform bed and a long shelf 'desk with an iron chair . </s> <s> No amenities ; no homey touches ; nothing on the walls . </s> <s> No room service ; no gym ; no concierge . </s> <s> The air conditioner clunked off and on all night . </s> <s> On the plus side ; the bedding was nice and there was a large screen TV . </s> <s> Don 't waste your money .

<s> I reserved the " Rock star " suite for my boyfriend 's birthday months and months in advanced . </s> <s> When we arrived at the Hotel Monaco ; they told us that they doubled booked the room . </s> <s> This was after many emails to the hotel inquiring about the room and if it was available . </s> <s> They tried to make up for it by providing us with a room with a wonderful view of the river and giving us a ten dollar gift certificate to their resturant - which we didn 't even use . </s> <s> I felt we were taken advantage of because we were young . </s> <s> The doorman didn 't make us feel any better when he told us that it wasn 't the first time they did this for the " rock star " suite . </s> <s> However ; the conceirge was incredible with providing us with a bottle of champagne for his birthday and delivered the birthday cake I ordered . </s> <s> If it wasn 't for the room confusion - It would have been a wonderful stay .

<s> While overall a decent property ; the incident I had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel . </s> <s> I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco for five nights ; checking out on Monday ; March 19th . </s> <s> Shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet ; my partner and I noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasn 't present upon checking in . </s> <s> We had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay . </s> <s> I called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at Park One 'their valet company ' who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival ; and was scraped upon departure from the garage . </s> <s> The garage manager ; Mike Yunan ; didn 't call back until I had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel ; Marco Scherer . </s> <s> When he finally got back to me ; the garage manager stated that he would file an " incident report " and claim with his insurance company ; Travelers ; which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldn 't admit fault or liability ; nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage ; which could have verified that the damage wasn 't present upon check-in ; but was at check-out . </s> <s> Their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location ; contradicting the garage manager . </s> <s> In the end ; this Kimpton InTouch guest got stuck with a $1 ; 000 bill for parking at this Kimpton property : an almost $500 paint scrape on top of a $48 'per day parking fee ; rental car expenses ; several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue ; and one gigantic headache . </s> <s> In the end ; do NOT trust the valets or staff at this hotel ; and take your business elsewhere if at all possible . ' </s> 
<s> The service was reasonably well . . . they seemed to have my reservation and checked me in fairly easily . </s> <s> The location was fine being that it was central to the city but I found out that it was also a tremendous drawback . </s> <s> It was interesting that the survey I took at the hotel in order to obtain internet access at the hotel asked what my most important quality was in a hotel visit and my response " Quiet " . </s> <s> My visit was anything but ; mainly attributed to the fact that they put me on the second floor ; facing the street . </s> <s> I awoke at 4 a . m . </s> <s> and never did return to sleep because of the constant street noise and screeching of the L train that sounded as though it was just outside my window . </s> <s> Not the most conducive for a restful sleep prior to an important meeting . </s> <s> At check-out when I informed the hotel clerk of my dissatisfation he chuckled and said ; " Ah ; city noise . " '
<s> The hotel was undergoing renovations so it was dirty and noisy . </s> <s> The entrance was really scary since it was covered with scaffolding ; making it dark . </s> <s> They charge a lot for internet hook up ; wifi is not included . </s> <s> The staff was very slow ; I am assuming they were all new . </s> <s> They could not say where anything was or what attractions were nearby . </s> <s> The room was set up weird ; the bathroom opened facing the bed ; rather than the hall as most do . </s> <s> Room temp was hard to control ; even though they had a digital thermostat . </s> <s> Overall I was very disappointed ; had I been staying more than one night I would have switched hotels .

<s> In the 100 degree heat of a Chicago summer ; it sucks if your air conditioner does not work . </s> <s> After 2 maintenance men attempted to rectify the issue I was offered a portable fan which on low speed sound as if a helicopter was hoovering over my room . </s> <s> I requested a room change and a not so polite ; unsympathetic night front desk attendant stated that was not possible because the hotel was at capacity . </s> <s> Maybe a manager could help me in the morning . </s> <s> The next day went by and no call was received . </s> <s> At 7pm ; I called the front desk . </s> <s> No one was aware of my problem . </s> <s> Approximately 45 minutes later ; a manager returned my call and stated a double room was available . </s> <s> I accepted it was glee . </s> <s> Anything was better than a room that does not cool below 78 degrees in the middle of summer . </s> <s> I was paritally correct . </s> <s> The bathroom door of the new room did not close . </s> <s> Thank god my boyfriend and I are past the shy part of the relationship . </s> <s> As for room 1618 ; I believe I was not the first guest to complain about the air conditioner . </s> <s> What 's unfortunate is they continued to place guests into this room . </s> <s> And did not offer any reufunds or perks for my sleepless night in the sauna ! </s> <s> This hotel need a major overhaul ! !

<s> As a regular visitor to Chicago and a freuent guest at the Ambassador East ; I was exceptionally disappointed during our last visit . </s> <s> Room service has been eliminated despite the renowned Pump Room being located in the hotel ; there was no in-room directory ; the carpet was torn and stained ; no phone book ; the refigerator and honor bar had been removed ; and the room was so small I had to turn sideays to get past the bed and the armoire . </s> <s> I asked the desk clerk about larger rooms ; and he said they were all the same except for corner rooms - which is untrue ; as there are several larger room types . </s> <s> He didn 't even offer to check availablity of other rooms ! </s> <s> In talking with the consierge ; she blamed everything on upcoming renovations - which the hotel has been promising for more than two years . </s> <s> All in all ; a very disappointing ; and expensive ; experience .

<s> I had my wedding ceremony and reception at the Sofitel . </s> <s> It seems as though I had the same experience as " Judy L .

<s> We have been for the first time in Chicago and stayed in the Swissotel for five nights ; a wonderful place . Room was on the 29th floor ; absolutely clean and nice and a breathtaking lakeview .

<s> Spent three nights in Chicago at this property . </s> <s> First of all ; I have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the Magnificent Mile close to terrific restaurants ; the Art Institute and Orchestra Hall . </s> <s> The hotel has two sides - the historic tower and a new wing . </s> <s> The rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired . </s> <s> This property needs to be renovated . </s> <s> Some observations : The junior suite I had was laid out strangely . </s> <s> A small bedroom and smaller sitting room separated by a corridor off of which was the very large bathroom . </s> <s> The mirror over the sink was not over the sink but skewed to the right - made shaving a challenge and messy . </s> <s> While descending in the elevator one morning ; it started shaking so violently that I could barely stand up . </s> <s> It stopped on the 11th floor and I was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a technician shut it down . </s> <s> 'This experience was far more powerful than coffee in helping me wake up - an adrenaline rush certainly cures sleepiness ! ' </s> <s> Reports from my group were of sinks stopped up ; exposed bolts in rooms ; and generally things not working . </s> <s> Now the good news - the staff is terrific . </s> <s> They make you feel welcome ; are personable ; have their own personalities ; great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help . </s> <s> I wish they had a better property to work in . ' </s> 
<s> We got a spanking deal at this hotel for $99 a night . </s> <s> It 's in a good location to the Loop . </s> <s> Excellent transportation options abound . </s> <s> My gripe comes from the fact that we were obviously put in a " crappy " room . </s> <s> It overlooked the back of the building and the roof of a building next to us . </s> <s> The toilet in the room was not bolted to the floor . </s> <s> Other than that ; if I needed to stay in the Loop again for something and I knew I wasn 't going to be put in a undesirable room ; I would stay here again . ' </s> 
<s> We chose to stay at a small hotel because we did were looking for a hotel with less crowds . </s> <s> We anticipated we would get better service in a smaller hotel ; than some of the other larger high rise hotels . </s> <s> We did not experience very good service at the Talbott Hotel . </s> <s> When we checked Irena seemed very robotic and aloof . </s> <s> The front desk clerks were neither welcoming nor gracious . </s> <s> The lobby is small and the front desk is just a few feet from the front door . </s> <s> Each time we came into the hotel we were never greeted nor even received a smile from the staff ; just a blank stare and gaze . </s> <s> The front desk staff was chilly and stiff ; no greetings ; no smiles and no personality . </s> <s> They had difficulty answering simple questions or requests . </s> <s> On the other hand the bellman Perry was great . </s> <s> He was sociable and very service oriented . </s> <s> He was aware of what is going on in the area . </s> <s> He recognizes the guests and he offered suggestions about things to do in the immediate area ; and where to eat in the neighborhood . </s> <s> He is authentic and he even asked us upon our return " how was that restaurant ? " Tim the concierge was also supportive . </s> <s> He gave us 10% discount coupons for shopping at the major department stores . </s> <s> We had the largest suite . </s> <s> We requested a rollaway 'extra charge ' when we made our reservation and we had to ask five different times to have the rollaway bed delivered to our room before it came after 10PM . </s> <s> When the rollaway finally came we had to call back the front desk because they did not deliver a blanket or pillow with the bed . </s> <s> What made our Talbott hotel experience most disappointing was that we may have never received any housekeeping unless we had asked to have our room cleaned . </s> <s> We were out of our room from 8AM and when we returned to our room at 4PM the rooms had not been cleaned . </s> <s> We called the front desk to ask to send someone . </s> <s> The maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening . </s> <s> The room itself was pleasant . </s> <s> It did have a moldy smell and some Frabreez would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much . </s> <s> We were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin . </s> <s> We really liked staying in this area of Chicago but expected first rate service . </s> <s> The service was very weak and unacceptable for this class of hotel . ' </s> 
<s> The hotel is well located ; but the service is poor . </s> <s> They seem to cater to large conventioneers ; with service more like a moderate chain hotel - not your typical Fairmont . </s> <s> There are too many specifics to outline here ; let 's just say that from the front desk ; to the spa ; room service which only got my order correct one-day ; to housekeeping which didn 't even clean my room one day 'although they sent a manager to inspect the room because the housekeeper said she did clean the room . </s> <s> Yep ; that 's just what you want to come home to after 10 hrs of meetings ! </s> <s> They did offer me a complimentary breakfast for my inconvenience ! </s> <s> The hotel is large and many times between 5-7 pm there would literally be a long line of guests waiting for an elevator . </s> <s> I 've stayed at this Fairmont twice . </s> <s> The 1st time I attended a conference nearby and the last time l chose it for the price . </s> <s> But it 's not worth enduring such poor service . </s> <s> That was the last time for me . ' </s> 
<s> I was attending a training conference in Chicago and opted to book my own room thru one of the online discount programs rather than stay at the rather sterile and pedestrian hotel where the conference was being held . </s> <s> I booked 4 nights at the Intercontinental and was pleased with the elegance and convenient location 'an easy walk to the conference ' . </s> <s> From the lobby to the rooms ; this hotel lives up to it 's storied reputation . </s> <s> 'The indoor pool seems to be imported from the set of a Busby Berkeley movie ! ' </s> <s> And even tho ' I was there for a conference ; the hotel 's location on the Mag Mile and a quick jaunt to restaurants and theaters ; made for a very pleasant stay at a very affordable price . ' </s> 
<s> Not a good start when the front desk isn 't willing to tell their customers that they have a problem with your room ! </s> <s> We reserved a King Suite ; and the hotel put us in a Queen Suite without telling us up front . </s> <s> Only after we confronted the Manager did they come clean about the switch ; he offered us a free breakfast ; but would not up-grade our room . </s> <s> The whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the Omni . </s> <s> We will not be retuning to this Hotel again . ' </s> 
<s> Just got back from a 10 day visit to Chicago . </s> <s> For the rate of $219 per night ; it was extremely good value . </s> <s> Reception staff were efficient ; courteous and very friendly . </s> <s> I was given a room on the top floor '32nd floor ' facing the lake and the John Hancock Tower . </s> <s> The rooms were large and very comfortable . </s> <s> Housekeeping 'Turn Down Service were efficient and thorough . </s> <s> Bathroom amenities were very good and replaced daily . </s> <s> This is definitely my first choice for a Hotel in Chicago . </s> <s> It is also very close to all the shops ; restaurants and the subway . ' </s> 
<s> As a frequent traveler for work ; I stay at many SPG properties . </s> <s> Compared to all the SPG property in Chicago ; this is by far the worst . </s> <s> Why ? </s> <s> 1 ' They charge you to use the gym . </s> <s> $12 per day or something like $24 for your entire stay . </s> <s> I can 't even begin on what a rip off that is . </s> <s> 2 ' As a Gold or Platinum member ; you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room . </s> <s> They do not offer that option here and you have to make a fuss about it before they give you one . </s> <s> 3 ' They do not have wireless internet . </s> <s> It is 2010- enough said . </s> <s> To charge you at least over $200 a night ; all the above amenities should be built into that cost . </s> <s> I would never stay here again . ' </s> 
<s> Under the gloss of a nice building ; friendly staff ; and a wild set of items in the minibar ; this is somewhat below-average hotel . </s> <s> In particular ; the bed and chairs were some of the least comfortable I ever encountered . </s> <s> After two nights ; my wife and I were practically cripped by bed pain . </s> <s> We complained to the staff and were immediately offered the chance to switch to a different room ; but the other room was furnished identically . </s> <s> The owners of the Omni need to stop spending money on bath salts for the rooms and invest in the basic comforts . </s> <s> I should not be lying on the floor ; trying to unkink my back ; thinking longingly of the last Red Roof Inn I visited . ' </s> 
<s> Upon check in - the lobby was BUSY ! </s> <s> I was tired and not feeling well from a tough road show . </s> <s> The Front Desk person I checked in with was so fast and so nice that I walked away from the desk smiling . . . </s> <s> that alone was such a great feeling . </s> <s> Every time I had any experience with a hotel staff member ; I was so pleased ! </s> <s> I have to say - service really is everything to me and I have to give this top marks for that . </s> <s> An added bonus was the location . . . </s> <s> I just think it is perfect for me . </s> <s> On top of that ; I had a meeting down in the loop ; but not quite sure how to get there - a person approached me in the lobby ; asked if he could help me get to my meeting . </s> <s> I thought he was getting me a taxi - but no - he walked me to his SUV and drove me to the meeting ; " just a free service from the hotel " he stated as we drove . . . </s> <s> really ! ! ! ! </s> <s> so cool ! </s> <s> I haven 't even talked about the Pump Room yet - great dinner ; very professional service ; and no attitude . </s> <s> I will return - just up date the rooms a little bit ; thats all . . . </s> <s> the curtains need some help . ' </s> 
<s> Nice big rooms but stinky mildew hallways ; fair room service menu and weird elevator set up really hurt my review on the Omni . </s> <s> Location was great but there are a lot of other options . </s> <s> If you get a really good deal on the room ; I wouldn 't say no . ' </s> 
<s> After Leaving some important documents in the room ; I called and asked for the lost and found department . . . </s> <s> SEVEN TIMES over the course of a week . </s> <s> Eventually I had enough and asked for a manager and was put on hold then disconnected . </s> <s> Finally ; a deceivingly friendly operator PROMISED me she would have someone call me back in a few minutes ; It never happened . </s> <s> So Avoid this place because after they rip you off once they 'll keep doing it later . </s> <s> They cannot be trusted at their word '
<s> Very Very noisy - Constant water running through pipes . </s> <s> It was terrible ! ! </s> <s> There are much better hotels to stay at in Chicago . </s> <s> Thier parking rate is obnoxious '$42 . 00 a night ' and way too far out to walk to much . </s> <s> If you must stay here ; try to park for free on dead end street 'feed meter on weekdays ' and take the stairs down to the next street level and you will find a Jewel grocery store for sodas 'snacks . </s> <s> 'A can of soda at the hotel was $4 . 50 plus 18% restocking fee ! ! ' </s> <s> '
<s> Stayed in April for two nights . </s> <s> I hesitated selecting the Sheraton becaue I had a very poor stay there earlier this year . </s> <s> As far as I 'm concerned ; that 's two strikes and I won 't give them a chance at ' three . </s> <s> Doormen wouldn 't help on arrival ; huge line at c 'i ; lousy room ; malfunctioning remote ; unresponsive staff ; and incorrect bill . </s> <s> If you want to be close to Michigan Ave ; try the Westin or Intercontinental and spare yourself the problems . </s> <s> I don 't understand why certain places never improve . </s> <s> Is it that tough to properly train a staff ? ' </s> 
<s> I stayed here for a conference and got the conference rate of $149 . </s> <s> I was worried that I wouldn 't get a nice room ; since it was the weekend before the election and the hotel is across the street from Grant Park ; so it could easily have gotten a lot more for the nicer rooms . </s> <s> I requested a quiet room away from elevators and foot traffic ; and that is exactly what I was assigned 'perhaps because I am also a 'silver ' member ? ' </s> <s> . </s> <s> It was a beautiful room with windows on two sides ; a king sized bed . </s> <s> The room was quiet ; comfortable and immaculate . </s> <s> The maid even left a thank you note for the tip I had left . </s> <s> All the staff were helpful ; polite and cheerful . </s> <s> I appreciated the fact that I could actually purchase a breakfast for under $15 'oatmeal ; coffee ; and juice '--something not possible at a lot of big hotels ; like the Hyatt I stayed at last year . ' </s> 
<s> In my experience the Ambassador hotel didn 't seem to be a 3 1 '2 star establishment . </s> <s> The building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated . </s> <s> The carpeting was very old and worn . </s> <s> The floor - carpeting and tile both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable . </s> <s> I would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel . </s> <s> Currently ; it 's indespirate need of renovation . ' </s> 
<s> Just putting in a good word for the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago . </s> <s> The reviews I read before going were mixed so we were not sure what to expect . </s> <s> The location was perfect . </s> <s> The hotel was beautiful . </s> <s> Our view was awesome . </s> <s> The room was large enough and very clean . </s> <s> The bed was very comfy . </s> <s> The staff were helpful - especially the concierge ; Jared . </s> <s> I couldn 't find anything negative to say . </s> <s> If you want to stay in downtown Chicago - you can 't go wrong with this cool hotel . ' </s> 
<s> We really enjoyed our brief stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker ! </s> <s> From the front desk personnel and bellmen to the housekeeping staff and bartender ; everyone we met was helpful and welcoming . </s> <s> Our 11th-floor room was clean and beautiful ; and the view looking north to the Drake Hotel and apartments across the street was nice . </s> <s> The in-room coffee service was appreciated ; too . </s> <s> There isn 't a lot of room in the bathroom for your toiletries ; but I 'd still take a room in a beautiful older hotel with character over a spacious-but-cookie-cutter room any day ! ' </s> 
<s> We got an outstanding rate by signing up for the hotels ' website newsletter . </s> <s> Affinia has a great location just off Michigan Avenue near the Water Tower . </s> <s> Beware however : parking is expensive in the Gold Coast . . . . $48 'night . </s> <s> Right from the start ; Victor greeted us and made us feel welcome . </s> <s> Check-in was easy and our room was gorgeous . </s> <s> However ; it was a handicapped acessible room and I wanted a tub ; so one call to the front desk and we had another room . </s> <s> All rooms have been renovated and they are beautiful ; comfortable and well appointed . </s> <s> The rooftop bar is a must-do . </s> <s> The outside patio has heaters and candles ; a high table for big groups and little groupings of chairs and sofas to get comfy on and enjoy the views . </s> <s> We didn 't sit inside the bar area . </s> <s> Pedro and Quentin were excellent bellmen ; and Christopher 'concierge ' was very helpful . </s> <s> As we left ; we shook Victor 's hand 'he 's always there ! ' </s> <s> and told him we 've found our new Chicago hotel ! ' </s> 
<s> I booked two rooms four months in advance at the Talbott . </s> <s> We were placed on the top floor next to the elevators ; which are used all night long . </s> <s> When speaking to the front desk ; I was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor ; which I had requested for a better view . </s> <s> I am looking at a brick wall ; and getting no sleep . </s> <s> He also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor ; and were aware of the noise problem . </s> <s> Why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked ? </s> <s> A request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the TOP floor and using that request to justify this . </s> <s> If you decide to stay here ; request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator ! </s> <s> I spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences . </s> <s> This is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain . ' </s> 
<s> At the last minute ; my son and I decided to take a quick trip to Chicago to see the Cubs . </s> <s> After checking Priceline I decided to book the Omni because of the great price for airfare and hotel . </s> <s> We arrived at the hotel around noon and our room was ready 'I had called ahead and requested early arrival ' . The front desk treated us like we were there best customers-very friendly and accomodating . </s> <s> The room was wonderful with all the modern conviences you would expect in an upscale hotel . </s> <s> The room was spotless and the bed was VERY comfortable . </s> <s> There was not one sign of bed bugs as mentioned in a previous review-maybe those bed bugs were from their luggage and were transferred into their room ! ! ! We then went to the hotel restaurant and had lunch . </s> <s> Our service was great as was the food . </s> <s> We also tried several restaurants around the Omni-all within walking distance . </s> <s> The service ; cleanliness and location of the Omni were incredible . </s> <s> We will definitely go back . ' </s> 
<s> We 've stayed here before but this time around was a marked difference in quality and service - the staff wasn 't rude ; just incompetent . </s> <s> For example ; we ordered wine glasses for the room because the hotel no longer services a mini bar in the room ; which seemed like a really cheap way to go for this type of hotel . </s> <s> Nonetheless ; the staff brought us 4 coffee mugs . . . </s> <s> The list of issues goes on unfortunately ; including the low grade in-room movie options - our audio and video did not sync on our rental ; we eventually had to stop watching after 20 minutes . </s> <s> And the room itself was not clean ; the bathroom sink vent holes were black with mold . </s> <s> Clearly the hotel has pulled back on not only amenities ; but training or sufficient staff . . . </s> <s> oh ; but the price point for this hotel has stayed the same . </s> <s> Find a newer hotel ; there are many in this great city . ' </s> 
<s> Not worth the price ; even a little bit . </s> <s> A week prior to scheduled check-in ; receiving an email for a room upgrade and accepting ; of course ; upon arrival ; nobody knows about it . </s> <s> Typical . </s> <s> After nobody was doing anything about it ; I notified them of this stay 's review will be posted on the newly-developing TheChicagoCritic . </s> <s> Com ; all of a sudden they figured out the problem and even offered an early check-in . </s> <s> Too little ; Too late . </s> <s> Very small room with 2 queens instead of the " Select King " I was supposed to have . </s> <s> Windows didnt open ; TV took forever to change channels and the bathroom fan was not controllable . </s> <s> The faboulous Lodge Net system that every hotel in the world uses for ease of checkout for guests ; well there was no check out feature . </s> <s> This shit hole couldn 't hold a candle to the Las Vegas Hard Rock ! ' </s> 
<s> This a great property ; excellent location and wonderful staff . </s> <s> Everyone was very accommodating and polite . </s> <s> The room I had was on the 23rd floor and was like a suite ; with a living area and a bedroom . </s> <s> The living room was spacious ; with a plasma TV ; a desk and a couch . </s> <s> The beds were very comfortable and the toiletries of very good quality . </s> <s> In the closed they placed an umbrella ; which came in handy ; it rained the whole time I was in Chicago . </s> <s> The internet connection is $9 . 95 '24hrs . </s> <s> Great place ; I will return for sure . ' </s> 
<s> Maybe it was because we booked thru priceline that we were treated like second rate guest - couldn 't get a room thru Fairmont website as busy weekend with Ryder Cup . . . . . but never have had this experience in using priceline before . </s> <s> The night time check in girl was rude and unhelpful . </s> <s> We were told no options to pay for upgrade or king bed and that we were stuck with two tiny beds and a ugly room . </s> <s> We had comforter with dirt in several places - and a bathroom for handicap with no counter space - had to use ironing board for toiletries . </s> <s> This hotel is huge and not at capacity - may have had a renovation but the good look of this hotel stops at the lobby . </s> <s> Hallways ; rooms ; carpet run down - just not what you come to expect of a fairmont . </s> <s> I have stayed in many all over the world and this is by far the worst . </s> <s> Maybe because we were on a low floor it was not updated . . . we paid as much as other guest and I 'm a Fairmont Gold member . </s> <s> Positives - great location ; daytime staff helpful at desk - they have two bikes to borrow which is handy . </s> <s> Views could be great if you get a higher room . </s> <s> Checked out the Raddison Blu across street - looked much nicer ! ! ! ' </s> 
<s> Stayed at the Chicago Hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door I was very impressed . </s> <s> Check-in was quick ; easy and I was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check-in time . </s> <s> We were given a twin room with two bathrooms which was brilliant . </s> <s> It made getting ready to go out much quicker ! </s> <s> The hotel location is great opposite the park ; which is a must see . </s> <s> Although located on South Michigan Ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of Michigan Ave . </s> <s> Would also recommend the street one block back from Michigan Ave for good shopping . </s> <s> For breakfast I would recommend grabbing a muffin ; croissant or bagel from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant . </s> <s> For evening entertainment Kitty O 'Sheas is a must . </s> <s> Typical Irish bar with good drinks and live music . </s> <s> Finally the bed at Hilton Chicago is the most comfortable bed ever . </s> <s> I would have taken it home if I could ! </s> <s> Definately made for a good nights sleep . ' </s> 
<s> Even though the reviews of this hotel are very good ; the only good thing about it is the Location ; which is excelent . </s> <s> aside from that ; there are only 2 elevators ; so there is ALWAYS a wait to get in . </s> <s> they also seem to have insufficient staff so getting your luggage ; room service ; etc takes forever . </s> <s> even if you arrive in a cab ; there is no space to load 'unload so you have to block the street while you arrive 'depart ; the rooms seem a bit dated and in need of a refresh . </s> <s> all in all ; there are much better options in Chicago '
<s> I 'll keep it short . </s> <s> My wife ; daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights . </s> <s> We go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel . </s> <s> Location : It is located in the center of the Magnificent Mile 'Michigan Ave . ' </s> <s> ; so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do . </s> <s> Hotel : The hotel itself is very clean ; as were the rooms . </s> <s> Maid service was excellent ; including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service 'I think they missed a night ' . </s> <s> Service : Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind . </s> <s> They always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile . </s> <s> Every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room 'sometimes chocolates on our pillows ' . </s> <s> They always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it . </s> <s> There was no shortage of people to ask things . </s> <s> My only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get . </s> <s> They shouuld have more than one ; or longer hours . </s> <s> Other : We had breakfast in the 676 Restaurant and it was very good ; and well attended ; appointed . </s> <s> They even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet . </s> <s> The pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids . </s> <s> It was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking . </s> <s> Pool and changing areas were spotless . </s> <s> Room : Clean ; sunny and spacious . </s> <s> Probably over 400 sq . </s> <s> ft . </s> <s> - 2 TVs ; couch ; desk ; chairs - all in perfect shape . </s> <s> The windows open for some fresh air . </s> <s> Pillows were pretty comfortable . </s> <s> With all aspects considered ; I think this was an unbeatable value ! </s> <s> I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend . </s> <s> I truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel . </s> <s> It was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there . </s> <s> Omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number . </s> <s> The airlines have cornered the market on that . ' </s> 
<s> Well ; this used to be a Le Meridian Hotel ; and it has changed for the worse . </s> <s> We kept having to remind them we booked a package ; because we were being over-charged separately for everything ; when it should have been included . </s> <s> We were supposed to have champagne in the room upon arrival ; and did not . </s> <s> Two phone calls and three hours later ; it finally showed up . </s> <s> We tried to have a drink in the bar ; and even though we were the ONLY people there ; three servers 'bartenders came and went ; talking to each other ; not one of them acknowledging us . </s> <s> After ten minutes we left the hotel and went down the street for a drink . </s> <s> And don 't bother to pay extra for " City View " ; because you may get the view we had from only the sixth floor ; looking across the street directly into a plain brick wall - that is all we could see . </s> <s> Oh yes ; the valet lost his cell phone in someone 's car ; and called me at home today to see if we found it . </s> <s> He wanted me to call him back at home . </s> <s> Nice of the hotel to give out our personal information to the staff ; huh ? </s> <s> For the money ; stay at any other hotel in Chicago with the same price-point and it will be much much better . ' </s> 
<s> My wife and I decided to spend three days in Chicago last summer ; and booked via Expedia . </s> <s> When we first walked into the lobby we almost fell over at its ' beauty . </s> <s> It 's like something out of Europe . </s> <s> We were able to get a free room upgrade ; even though the rooms are still a bit small ; but its ' an old hotel in an old city . </s> <s> It 's there for sleeping and showering . </s> <s> The restaurants ; lounges ; and shops were all wonderfull . </s> <s> The next time we travel to Chicago ; I 'll be affraid to stay anywhere other than the Palmer House Hilton '
<s> We travel to Chicago regularly and have always wanted to stay at the Hilton Chicago . </s> <s> We booked a PriceLine room on the weekend of the half marathon . </s> <s> The place was busy ; but the staff certainly found time for each individual guest . </s> <s> The room was nice and just what we expected . </s> <s> The pool area is also very nice for a downtown hotel . </s> <s> The location was great as we were taking in the Bears 49ers game on a Thursday night and a Sox game on a Friiday night . </s> <s> We would certainly stay there again and would recomment it to others . </s> <s> Great quality even at the regular room price . ' </s> 
<s> Check ins went smoothly . </s> <s> But be advised . . . . </s> <s> Walls are super thin ; the building is old and the rooms are very very very small . </s> <s> The downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out . </s> <s> For the price it wasn 't bad . </s> <s> It was walking distance to most major attractions . </s> <s> Overall . . . </s> <s> it 's ok at best . </s> <s> Another plus is the CTA is close by . ' </s> 
<s> I loved this hotel - reasonable for downtown Chicago ; an older hotel with a great reno 'a bit over-the-top design ; but still very lovely and charming ' ; clean rooms ; and very friendly staff . </s> <s> They 're also amazingly pet-friendly - they welcomed our 130lb Mastiff cross with a gift bag 'treats and directions to an off-leash area ' ; and even had a cute blackboard with visiting dog 's names on it . ' </s> 
<s> Hi ; Stayed here for three nights recently ; From check in to check out all Staff members went out of their way to make sure everything was ok and if there was anything they could do to help us ; directions ; restaurants ; transport ; nothing was too much trouble ; The dinner from monday to thursday 5-7 was a wonderful surprise ; also the breakfast was more than adequet ; Stayed on the 15th floor and slept soundly ; Hotel close to everything for the tourist or business traveller . Restaurants and shopping all within 5-10 mins . ' </s> 
<s> we love the location and proximity to everything . </s> <s> The staff was very friendly and courteous . </s> <s> They were so nice to our 2 . 5 year old boy . </s> <s> got his backpack full of goodies the moment we arrived . </s> <s> We got free wifi and morning drinks by signing up for select guest program . </s> <s> Can 't beat that ! </s> <s> the only minor issue is the elevator . </s> <s> we have to take 2 separate elevator trips to get to our room . </s> <s> It got a little annoying when we were going in and out often . </s> <s> Otherwise ; it was a great stay ! ' </s> 
<s> staff was very courteous . </s> <s> desk clerk gave only one coupon for the free breakfast instead of two . </s> <s> second desk clerk gave the wrong time for the breakfast on the second day ; causing us to miss the free period . </s> <s> room was very clean ; with a nice view of the river . </s> <s> bed was very comfortable . </s> <s> toilet looked like it belonged in a public restroom 'no tank ; instead it had a stainless steel valve ' instead of a 4-star hotel . </s> <s> no dresser to store clothes . </s> <s> no wastebasket in the room ; and there was a cover for the icebucket ; but no icebucket . </s> <s> folding luggage stand had a broken strap . </s> <s> location was good ; close to the river . </s> <s> several american-style eating places nearby . </s> <s> overall ; a disappointment for a four-star hotel . </s> <s> i expected more for a hyatt regency .

<s> This hotel had a great location ; but you can do much better for the money . </s> <s> The hallways smelled of smoke ; dirty elevators ; furniture in the lobby was thread bare . </s> <s> The staff was very helpful . </s> <s> The room was large ; bed comfortable but the room was so musty and old smoke lingered . </s> <s> If you have any allergies don 't stay here ! ' </s> 
<s> Great building and location ; but . . . </s> <s> staff is indifferent ; you have to pay for WiFi 'after $300 usd 'night I would expect at least free WiFi ' ; no pool in the building and something I found really annoying is that ; if you move anything from the minibar ; they have sensors that automatically charge you . </s> <s> This is ridicoulus . The iPod dock in the room didn 't work . </s> <s> Also ; we had to move thenightstand between beds and found dirt all over . </s> <s> Definitely is not value for your money . </s> <s> You 're just paying for the Hard Rock brand . </s> <s> I will never go back to a Hard Rock Hotel .

<s> Three nights there on business . </s> <s> Hadn 't realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement ; very bleak . </s> <s> Told the front desk that I hadn 't realized about the construction ; so I 'd have to switch hotels ; they said they were still going to charge me for 3 nights . </s> <s> So I stayed . </s> <s> TV didn 't work . </s> <s> Tried to get them to fix it and they ignored me . . . eventually after I called again ; a few hours later ; a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it . </s> <s> Long and complicated experience at the business center 'which doesn 't open until 9am ; BTW ' ; where I ended up paying $45 to print 55 pages . </s> <s> Had to buy these cards ; and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway ; 'and charging me for them ' . </s> <s> I was left with $22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the Swissotel in Chicago ; 2000 miles from where I live . </s> <s> I asked for a refund on the card and -- no surprise -- she declined to help me with that . </s> <s> Nice room ; nice view ; but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad . </s> <s> Worst experience I 've ever had at a hotel when traveling for business . ' </s> 
<s> great bed ; but when I first came in ; I requested a room with a lake view 'i requested this over the phone as well ' ; and the front desk woman said " this is a great room " . </s> <s> I go upstairs and its awful looking . </s> <s> The view was of the neighboring roofs . </s> <s> Then I spent half an hour trying to find a better room . </s> <s> Eventually I got a corner roof with a partial view . </s> <s> Horrible experience . </s> <s> also rooms were small and had crappy look 'yellowy wallpaper and bedsheets ' '
<s> We choose to stay at the hotel due to the high rooftop ratings at the hotel . </s> <s> Not only is the rooftop terrace on the 5th floor ; but it was occuppied with private corporate events for the entire duration of our stay . </s> <s> We did - as recommended - have a drink indoors only to be highly insulted by their bartender there . </s> <s> There is no breakfast buffet - you order a la carte . </s> <s> Keep that in mind when paying extra for breakfast and internet . </s> <s> Also note that the minibar is empty on arrival - we were only told on departure that we would have needed to call reception to order . </s> <s> We have stayed at the Omni before and it as a much better experience . </s> <s> I dont recommend spending so much for a mediocre hotel . ' </s> 
<s> I stayed in a Deluxe King Suite . </s> <s> No desk to work at or to sit at to eat room service meals . </s> <s> The only table was coffee table height and the couch was some strange futon that was lower than the coffee table ' ! ' </s> <s> and canted forward . </s> <s> Incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and ridiculous for room service meals or to work at computer . </s> <s> Since my room was configured like all the other Deluxe King Suites depicted in on line photos ; I have to assume this design flaw with the couch 'futon runs throughout the property . </s> <s> Bed was fine and bath was fine but I can 't imagine why business travelers would rate this property well . </s> <s> The couch 'futon seating is the worst I 've encountered in a modern hotel .

<s> I stayed here for business and loved it . </s> <s> Got it for $93 inc tax on Priceline ; an incredible deal for this hotel . </s> <s> If I wasn 't on priceline I would expect to pay $200 per night 'maybe more ' for this location 'level of service . </s> <s> It 's in the heart of downtown Chicago ; walkable to many locations . </s> <s> The lobby is very impressive ; the room was very nice . </s> <s> No complaints at all ; from check-in to check-out . </s> <s> I was alone so didn 't go to the bar but it looked like people were really enjoying themselves . </s> <s> It was full of people all the time . </s> <s> I want to stay here when I come back with my husband for a fun weekend in the city .

<s> We recently stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel for a week . </s> <s> The hotel was in a wonderful location and the service was great . </s> <s> We found all of the staff very helpful and prompt . </s> <s> We highly recommend the Intercontinental for any travel needs whether it be for business or pleasure . ' </s> 
<s> The heating in our room didn 't work and wasn 't repaired depite numerous requests ; the rooms were very small ; the litter in the bin remained in the bin for the whole stay ; the cleaner made the bed but nothing else ; when we returned home my credit card statement showed that the hotel had charged me for the 5 night stay despite my having pre-paid through a travel agent ; it took the hotel 2 months to re-credit my card without an apology or offer to pay for my numerous trans-Atlantic phone calls to them .

<s> We stayed at the Fairmont two nights for the SOFA art fair at the Navy Pier . </s> <s> I was impressed that the bellman called us by name when he met the taxi and pronounced it correctly ; which is quite unusual . </s> <s> Everyone smiled and welcomed us . </s> <s> The lobby looks clean and friendly ; not ultramodern ; but not at all tired or worn . </s> <s> Our room ; also clean and comfortably furnished ; was larger than we expected ; with a clean ; modern bath and a lovely view of the Navy Pier and the lake . </s> <s> We did not eat at the restaurant ; but it looked attractive . </s> <s> Our only problem was that we had asked for non-feather pillows ; upon reserving the room ; upon checking in ; and calling housekeeping . </s> <s> After waiting an hour ; we went to bed . </s> <s> The next day the check-in desk person was extremely apologetic and by the time we returned ; all the feathers were replaced with foam and non-allergenic materials . </s> <s> The hotel is convenient to Millenium Park and Michigan Ave . </s> <s> We would stay there again ; assuming we could get good rates .

<s> I stayed at the Chicago Hilton because it was host to a conference I was attending . </s> <s> Before I arrived I tried to find out about the " In Room Fitness " program advertised on the corporate website . </s> <s> I called the 800 reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center . </s> <s> I explained that I was inquiring about the 'In Room Fitness ' advertised on their website . </s> <s> She put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that I should call the property directly . </s> <s> I did and got the same response . </s> <s> I asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room . </s> <s> Again ; this was a problem . </s> <s> When I arrived at the hotel ; no treadmill was available . </s> <s> When I went to tour the fitness room the first night I found that they close at 9pm . </s> <s> When I returned to the center the next day I discovered that they charge $13 per day to use the fitness equipment . </s> <s> The pool ; track and locker room are free ; but to use the treadmills ; etc . </s> <s> you have to pay $13 per day . </s> <s> This charge is not noted anywhere -- not on the website ; not in any of the guest service materials in the room . </s> <s> The food for the conference was mediocre ; but the one room service meal I had was pretty good . </s> <s> During one of the conference lunch sessions the wait staff made so much noise we couldn 't hear the speaker . </s> <s> The HVAC didn 't work well in my room and I kept the windows open for most of my three night stay . </s> <s> The beds were comfortable with very nice linens . </s> <s> I tried to get a late checkout ; which was offered on a card in my room . </s> <s> The woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour ; not the 11-2pm range advertised in my room . </s> <s> The best service I received was from the folks in the Security office . </s> <s> The hotel does not have safes in guest rooms ; so I became very friendly with Security office as I locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time I couldn 't carry it out of the hotel . </s> <s> I visit Chicago at least once a year for personal travel and will continue to stay at the Marriott properties . </s> <s> Only wish I had done so for this visit .

<s> I thought the Swissotel was a great hotel . </s> <s> The rooms were very spacious and clean ; especially for downtown Chicago standards . </s> <s> Most importantly ; the rooms were quiet . </s> <s> I never heard people in the hallways when I was trying to sleep . </s> <s> The only downside was that the beds were not anything special . </s> <s> Sure ; like all hotels in Chicago ; this hotel caters to wealthy and 'or business clients with ridiculous minibar and parking price . </s> <s> However ; if you are aware of that prior to arrival ; its not a big deal 'ie finding a different place to park the car ; bringing our own snacks for the room ' . </s> <s> It would be nice though if hotels such as the Swissotel had a microfridge in the room for guest use . </s> <s> Staff was very helpful . </s> <s> Bellmen instantly got cabs upon request ; and the front desk was efficient and helpful . </s> <s> Overall ; if I can get a good rate again ; I 'll stay at the Swissotel the next time I am in Chicago .

<s> I travel a lot for business and quite frankly ; my expectations were starting to reach new lows . </s> <s> I usually always choose W Hotels just for the consistency 'of average hotels ' . </s> <s> The Affinia in Chicago has raised my expectations and W Hotels are going to suffer in comparison . </s> <s> This hotel is one of the cleanest I have stayed at in some time . </s> <s> Service was impeccable . </s> <s> Friendly front-desk staff and the extra towels I ordered arrived literally within minutes . </s> <s> The gym has new equipment with plenty of space . </s> <s> And such a fun vibe - without dark hallways and loud music . </s> <s> I have to thank the other reviewers - their reviews led me to the Affinia and I was so pleased . </s> <s> My new " Chicago Hotel " . </s> <s> It will even lead me to try the Manhattan hotels .

<s> Let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take 5-6 trips for pleasure on a yearly basis 'not including our business travel ' . </s> <s> We 've traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail . </s> <s> We were not at all impressed by this hotel . </s> <s> At $220 'night we were expecting a decent ; clean hotel but obviously not a 5 ' . </s> <s> We were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given '1546 ' . </s> <s> The paint 'wallpaper 'tub were peeling ; there was hair in both the tub 'toilet when we got to the room ; the internet service was extremely slow ; the toilet ran throughout the night ; and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in . </s> <s> We told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was " I know ; we can 't wait for our renovations . " If it hadn 't been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the UK ' booked into this hotel by a travel agent ; we would have checked out as soon as we checked in . </s> <s> Let me also add that the front desk seemed short-staffed as the check-in 'check-out process was painfully slow . </s> <s> All we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendly 'responsive door staff . </s> <s> In its day this was likely a lovely hotel ' but it is in dire need of a renovation . </s> <s> Despite its location I cannot understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a sub-par experience . </s> <s> We would never book at this hotel again .

<s> My expectations were not high because I booked this hotel through priceline for $58 ' night . </s> <s> An amazing deal if not for the fact that you had to wait 15 - 20 minutes for hot water . </s> <s> I called the front desk to tell them that there was no hot water - to which they nonchalantly replied : " try running it for 15 to 20 minutes .

<s> As a frequent traveler to Chicago ; I generally stay at the Sutton Court ; but thought I would try a different boutique hotel . </s> <s> I will never stay at this hotel again . </s> <s> The first room they brought me to -- their standard room -- was a glorified closet ; leaving me absolutely claustrophobic ! </s> <s> Actually the smallest hotel room I 've been in in the U .

<s> This review has two parts . </s> <s> . </s> <s> .

<s> I haven 't actually stayed at this hotel- yet- but am already disappointed in their customer service . </s> <s> I visit Chicago quite often and usually stay at the InterContinental ; but yesterday I read some online articles advertising The James Hotel 's " Cyber Monday Special " . </s> <s> The promo states that if you buy a gift certificate from their website ; the hotel will match that amount in " James Credits " that can be used toward your stay . </s> <s> None of the articles gave an expiration date for these credits . </s> <s> My next trip to Chicago is in April ; so I thought I 'd give The James a try . </s> <s> I travel frequently with my pet and I 've heard they have a very liberal pet-policy . </s> <s> So today I went online and bought a $500 certificate . </s> <s> Me ; having the one track mind that I do ; somehow missed the part about the credits expiring March 31 ; 2010 . </s> <s> I realized my mistake immediately and called the hotel front desk to explain my predicament . </s> <s> I said I couldn 't be in Chicago until April 'I 'm overseas on business until then ' ; and asked if they could extend my credits an extra month ; or it not ; refund my gift certificate purchase . </s> <s> I had only just made the purchase minutes before and hadn 't even recieved my email confirmation yet . </s> <s> Most businesses offer a 24 hr grace period . </s> <s> The girl at the front dest was extremely rude to me- basically saying " too bad ; it 's your problem now " . </s> <s> She didn 't even bother to act polite or pretend to be sympathetic about my situation at all . </s> <s> So now that I know this is the kind of service I can expect from The James ; I might just call it a wash and stay at my usual hotel ; or try Hotel Monaco . </s> <s> I hear they have great service and are good with pets too .

<s> Firtly they took $372 off my card ; even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night . </s> <s> They had no business taking the money off of my card . </s> <s> So on the 28th Sep I contacted them and they admited to the mistake . </s> <s> It is not a month later and I have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back . </s> <s> Secondly I booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel . </s> <s> When I looked a week later ; they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate ; so two of my friends didn 't come to the trip away . </s> <s> Thirdly I asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken ASAP as the dollar was weak against the pound . </s> <s> After about 8 phone calls over 5 months 'each saying they would ' they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional PS150 . </s> <s> Overall ; the hotel was nice and in a nice location ; but I will never be staying there again due to all my problems .

<s> The lines at the check in desk were tremendously long so we decided to use the computerized self check in . </s> <s> The only option the self check in gave us was the size of the bed . </s> <s> When we got to our room ; we immediately realized we were placed in a smoking room but we were unable or perhaps the staff was unwilling to move us to a non smoking room . </s> <s> I am allergic to the smoke and that made my stay uncomfortable . </s> <s> The walls seemed thin and we could clearly hear the conversations of the guests in the rooms next to us . </s> <s> When we went to breakfast ; we were seated quickly but it was nearly ten minutes before our server arrived . </s> <s> For the price they were charging ; the wait was unacceptable and we went elsewhere . </s> <s> It also took ten extra minutes than promised for the valet to get our car . </s> <s> For forty dollars a day for parking ; we expected better .

<s> We have just returned from a week at the James Chicago . </s> <s> The hotel is fabulous ; very chic and chilled . </s> <s> The service is beyond compare . </s> <s> Check in and out were swift and painless . </s> <s> The Concierge service is also super efficient having located an excellent hair salon and a couple of fab restaurants for us during our stay . </s> <s> The hotel restaurant itself is rated 5 in the top 10 in Chicago - voted by Chicago residents . </s> <s> We stayed on the 14th floor with great views of the city . </s> <s> The room 'a deluxe king ' was equipped with a great selection of cocktail making lovelies ; hairdryer ; safe ; tv ; robes ' slippers ; a very interesting selection of minibar items 'one of which was a real surprise ! ' </s> <s> including crisps 'snacks a first aid kit and an umbrella ! </s> <s> We also had a spotless and elegant bathroom with Kiehls products and a cosy little dining area . </s> <s> The ipod dock 'CD 'radio and complimentary chillout CD were a nice touch and husband liked the enormous plasma tv . </s> <s> The super comfy bed ensured a good snooze and complimentary WiFi allowed us to plan our next day 's activities from our bedroom . </s> <s> We were so busy touring around the city we didn 't get an opportunity to use the gym or the spa - both of which looked fab . </s> <s> The bar 'lobby area is a haven of civilised tranquility with smooth music playing in the background to help you chillout that bit more . </s> <s> Staff are attentive without being fussy and a good selection of drinks and bar snacks are available . </s> <s> The barman mixes a mean mohito ! </s> <s> This hotel is full of nice little thoughtful touches to make people feel welcomed and cared for e . g . </s> <s> The Virtual Tuck In service - basically a couple of PCs with webcams to allow people to say goodnight to their children when they 're away from home on business . </s> <s> Also the dog biscuits and water outside the front door for our furry friends . </s> <s> Next visit to Chicago I 'll definitely be staying here and wouldn 't even consider an alternative if The James can maintain these standards .

<s> Here are my experiences : - Had three rooms reserved ; when checked in we were charged 2 different rates for the rooms - screwed up initial room assignments ; gave us a room that was not even cleaned yet when we checked in - Could not get us new keys to a different room without great difficulty 'we had to go to the front desk because bell staff went to the wrong room to give us new keys ' - In room guide says pool in on the 8th floor and signs say it is on the 7th - could not get to the pool from the 14th floor without going all the way down to the lobby and then had to go to the 7th floor and take the stairs to the 8th - When we checked in we had the front desk staff go over which credit cards were assigned to which room . </s> <s> - When we received our bills ; the credit card assignments were still wrong . </s> <s> I stay at " economy " hotels a lot and I have not even come close to having this many problems with a hotel until this one . </s> <s> This hotel should do Chicago a service and just close its doors . </s> <s> Due to this experience ; I will never stay downtown again to deal with overpriced hotels with poor service and surrounding business that are just as bad . ' </s> 
<s> Rooms are so dark we had to insist they bring lamps so we could see . </s> <s> The room we had at almost $400 a night was dingy and small . </s> <s> Don 't mistakingly think the Hard Rock Cafe is there ; it isn 't . </s> <s> They have a Chinese restaurant that is overpriced and limited on items . </s> <s> The room service menu is broken down in terms of times you can order certain foods . </s> <s> When my wife wanted a milk shake we had to call the Manager to have it made since the kitchen staff said it wasn 't a choice . </s> <s> The Rolled Roast beef sandwich was listed under the 2 am choice and they refused to make it untill again ; we called the Manager who did get it to us . </s> <s> The staff did appear friendly ; although housekeeping totally disregarded our 'do not disturb ' sign and would call us on the phone . </s> <s> Don 't make the mistake of staying here but if you do ; walk across the street and buy snacks you want because even a soda is $3 plus 19% gratuity . </s> <s> We ended up having to order delivery food brought to us . </s> <s> This is the most overpriced ; over rated and dingy hotel we 've ever stayed in . </s> <s> Taxi to airport is $40 .

<s> Ok ; so first trip to chicago and I was a litlle worried about the hotel and the location ; finally I decided on the CONRAD and wath a good experience i had ; I booked a king deluxe room on the 6th floor ; view was not amazing but that was the only coplaint i could had ; room is nice ; bath was all appliances and good size ; good plasma tv ; free internet ; we asked one day for breaksfast and amazing food ! </s> <s> so overall and for the price aroufn 220 It was a great surprise ; the locating was very good a few blocks from everything and very quiet hotel '
<s> Well located and well staffed . </s> <s> The Amalfi was a clean and comfortable place to stay . </s> <s> It lacks a restaurant or bar but many are near by . </s> <s> Free continental breakfast and evening cocktail . ' </s> 
<s> I stayed here August 20 through 23rd with my sixteen year old son and we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel . </s> <s> The price was very reasonable for a hotel located right on Michigan Avenue . </s> <s> The front desk and concierge service was excellent and enhanced our stay by making it easy for us to plan fun activities . </s> <s> The John Entwistle theme on our floor was a nice touch . </s> <s> Any of you single fathers out there can appreciate how difficult it can be to take a fun affordable vacation with your children and The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago really helped me accomplish just that !

<s> The Conrad Hotel is a beautiful hotel . </s> <s> Our room was perfect and beautiful in every way . </s> <s> I was very impressed 'and I am hard to please and have high standards ' . </s> <s> It was so clean ; aesthetically pleasing ; up to date ; just gorgeous ! </s> <s> I would definitely stay there again . </s> <s> I loved it . </s> <s> The location is superb too ; attached to Nordstrom and Northbridge mall . </s> <s> Can 't wait to go back !

<s> This comes a little late as I 'm finally catching up on my reviews from the past several months : ' A dear friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in late October 2007 for one night while visiting a friend and her husband from out of town . </s> <s> This hotel is perfect ; IMO . </s> <s> Easy check in and check out . </s> <s> Lovely ; clean ; comfortable rooms with great views of the city . </s> <s> I know this area pretty well and it 's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions . </s> <s> We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St . . </s> <s> We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there 's even public transportation right near by but we didn 't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel . </s> <s> Parking ; as is usual for Chicago ; was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly 'however ; we left on a Sunday morning ; not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day ; so a bit busier than usual I would think ' . </s> <s> No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through Hotwire ; a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel .

<s> We stayed in the Amalfi in July 2010 ; 4th of July weekend . </s> <s> I was very apprehensive about leaving my Diesel Ford Excursion with the valet at Amalfi . </s> <s> It has a few modifications to the engine and can be damaged if not operated correctly . </s> <s> I explained the procedure to the valet drivers ; and felt like it was a complete waste of time . </s> <s> When the vehicle was returned to me the valet driver did not let it idle down and cool the turbo off as I had instructed . </s> <s> When I tried to start it ; it wasn 't happy ; but did finally start . </s> <s> I was so relieved to get it back I just wanted to leave . </s> <s> Driving away I noticed that the top speed recorded on the GPS was 105mph ! ! ! </s> <s> 'previous top speed was 95mph ; done a few days earlier driving across South Dakota ' . </s> <s> I could just picture the flying Ferrari scene in Ferris Bueller 's Day Off . </s> <s> I couldn 't imagine where in the crowded Chicago traffic they found a place to go that fast ; though it wouldn 't take long to make that happen 'see reference to modified engine above ' . </s> <s> A little while later we stopped for lunch and I noticed a dent in the front bumper . </s> <s> I contacted the hotel and was referred to their claims people . </s> <s> No remedy . </s> <s> Lesson learned . </s> <s> Brett '
<s> I stayed at the Hyatt for a two nights on a business trip . </s> <s> My room was oddly shaped to give a stunning view of the river and NBC Building . </s> <s> Both the room and the bathroom were spotless and the room had an air purifier which ran silently . </s> <s> The hotel was well staffed with individuals who were knowledgeable about both the hotel and the surrounding area . </s> <s> I would not hesitate to stay here again and plan to return with my wife for a weekend .

<s> I expected a glamorous room and I walked into a disappointment . </s> <s> Housekeeping and Management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel . </s> <s> If you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms doesn 't go down past 74 ; the closet is 24 " wide ; all old 'dirty brass fixtures ; beds that are a little bigger than a twin ; showerheads that barely put out water ; then this is your hotel . </s> <s> I might be spoiled by staying in Marriott 's ; but I stay in hotels 1 '3 of the year and was severly disappionted . </s> <s> No free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again .

<s> Generally speaking ; nothing bad about that place if there would not be the cleaning issue . </s> <s> We checked the closed with the mini bar 'picture uploaded ' ; so much dust ; nobody cleaned here for at least 3 years . </s> <s> We called in housekeeping ; giving them the opportunity to check and do something about it . </s> <s> Still the same situation when returning to the room 4 hrs . </s> <s> later . </s> <s> Next day moved to a renovated room ; much better but not 5 star clean at all . </s> <s> In addition ; there was never a time when there was no waiting line at the reception ; no wonder when just 1 '3 of the counters is actually open . </s> <s> Please do something about these issues its ruining everything !

<s> As others have said ; once all the construction works are completed I suspect that the prices this hotel can 'legitimately ' charge will put it out of our price range . </s> <s> Which will be a pity because it is an excellent hotel ; ' the location couldn 't be better . </s> <s> The room was very spacious ; with separate sitting ' study areas ' a nice bathroom . </s> <s> Only 3 minor points : downstairs they were serving a free basic breakfast 'coffee ' pastries ' ; but we only knew of it on our last morning - nobody had mentioned this ; the cost of internet - $9 . 99 - is a bit dear especially when lots of motels now offer it free ; there was only powered milk in the rooms ; which wasn 't that nice . </s> <s> But none of these really spolied a really enjoyable stay .

<s> I am a fan of Kimpton Hotels ; however I have never experienced top service as I did at the Hotel Allegro . </s> <s> Even before my visit ; concierge Mark Kraemer advised us on things to see ; and booked tickets in advance to Second City . </s> <s> We were welcomed warmly on arrival ; and the bellman checked up on us as we came and went from the hotel . </s> <s> All the staff have a personal interest in making your stay a great experience . </s> <s> The hotel is next to City Hall ; where I had some business . </s> <s> We had a large quiet room ; and used room service-the meal came quickly ; and included a a bonus fruit cup . </s> <s> Enjoyed the pasta night '20 dollars for a three course meal ' at the 312 restaurant-the starter and the dessert were wonderful ; the main pasta a bit too salty . </s> <s> And that is the only complaint I can make-from start to finish ; if you want attentive service ; this is the place to be . </s> <s> Thank you ; Hotel Allegro ; for a great stay . </s> <s> I can 't wait to return .

<s> This place had character I 'll give it that . </s> <s> But it wasn 't really my style . </s> <s> Arrived late in the evening . </s> <s> The first room they gave me the TV didn 't work . </s> <s> Maintenance took a look at it ; and couldn 't figure it out . </s> <s> Told me I 'd have to wait until the morning for the electrician . </s> <s> He then passed some gas and left . </s> <s> Real professional . </s> <s> I phoned the front desk on account of the tv ; and was able to get another room The second room was much like the first . </s> <s> Horrible striped wall paper ; dingy ; and old worn carpet . </s> <s> Bathroom was incredibly small . </s> <s> Hard to use the toliet without banging into the door ; or the sink . </s> <s> Very cramped . </s> <s> The beds weren 't very comfortable either . </s> <s> Room temp hard to regulate and the AC somewhat noisy . </s> <s> Location seem very convenient . </s> <s> I was there for a training session about 8 blocks away . </s> <s> But all of the theatres seemed to be near by ; if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two . </s> <s> And don 't make a long distance phone call from your room without a calling card . </s> <s> It was about $2 'minute . </s> <s> I knew it would be expensive but wasn 't expecting that type of rate . ' </s> 
<s> The recently remodeled Affina was amazing - from the 6 choice pillow menu to the stocked " pantry and refrigerator " to the brand name bathroom ammenities . </s> <s> Within walking distance to just about everything you could possibly need ; the Affina is a great hotel . </s> <s> The staff was pleasant and seemed to enjoy their jobs . </s> <s> Having never stayed in downtown Chicago before ; the Affina over and above exceeded our expectations . </s> <s> Although our trip to Chicago was only for one night ; we will consider staying at the Affina again for a future visit .

<s> We just returned from 4 nights at the Ambassador East . </s> <s> What a gem ! </s> <s> The location in the Gold Coast neighborhood is perfect for finding restaurants and walking the Magnificent Mile . </s> <s> There is a train station about 2 blocks away . </s> <s> The room was very comfortable ; with nice amenities ; and there is free Internet service on the 2nd floor . </s> <s> Best of all was the bell and lobby staff ! </s> <s> They really went out of their way to be helpful and greeted us warmly each time we left and arrived . </s> <s> I would say that this was the nicest hotel staff I 've encountered in all my travels .

<s> We recently completed our second stay at the Fairmont Chicago . </s> <s> The check-in process was quick and painless but the front desk staff was almost disinterested in the whole procedure . </s> <s> That is fine when I am traveling on business ; but on leisure trips I would appreciate a warmer greeting . </s> <s> The hotel was hosting a convention at the same time as our stay ; but other than seeing some signage 'attendees in the lobby ; we wouldn 't have noticed . </s> <s> This is probably due to the separation of the conference areas from the guest rooms and the 8 speedy elevators . </s> <s> We stayed in a Parkview Suite so we had a large room with a great view of Millenium Park . </s> <s> The anteroom was well appointed with a sofa ; coffee table ; desk ; mini-bar with sink and coffee maker ; and dining area . </s> <s> The bedroom appeared to be the same as a standard Fairmont room ; but maybe slightly larger . </s> <s> The bathroom also appeared to be similar to a standard Fairmont room ; and once again ; possibly slightly larger . </s> <s> The upscale modern decor is pleasing but not overtly luxurious ; and several small touches such as a shoe shine station 'with extra collar tabs ' ; are peppered throughout . </s> <s> We booked a few evening activities through the concierge and everything was perfectly handled . </s> <s> The hotel restaurant ; Aria ; couldn 't find our reservation but they oddly new my name and remembered that the hotel had called to make a reservation for us . </s> <s> They had no problem seating us and the dinner 'both food and service ' was lovely . </s> <s> Minor complaints : The pillows could be better . </s> <s> I 'm not sure if they remembered our preference for non-down bedding from our last visit ; but seriously ; these things barely felt like pillows . </s> <s> I 'll suffer through some congestion if I can get better neck support . </s> <s> Also ; the valet parking attendants seem overly eager to take your car 'and charge you $49 ' . </s> <s> And as I mentioned above ; the front desk experience could be improved . </s> <s> Best feature : After our first stay ; I gave a brief review in the comments section of the Fairmont President 's Club 'membership is free ' website . </s> <s> I received a phone call from the Director of Rooms the same day asking to discuss our experience . </s> <s> After this stay ; I left a comment essentially thanking the hotel staff for a great stay ; but still received a warm ; friendly phone call from the Director of Rooms asking if he could do anything to improve our next stay . </s> <s> Kudos to the Fairmont for taking its customers seriously ; and for that ; they 've won my loyalty .

<s> I 'm sitting in the hotel as I right this review and am not impressed with the room . </s> <s> The hotel is not modern in the least - it feels like you 're staying in your grandmother 's attic . </s> <s> Wallpaper is peeling off the wall ; not well lit ; very few outlets in the room -- especially convenient ones 'none next to the bed or built into lamps ' ; terrible views and loud construction noises woke me up at 7am . </s> <s> Even the location is off the beaten path - closest L stop is on the Red Line -- so not accessible via the loop stops on the blue line from the airport without transferring . </s> <s> Health club is not on site either . </s> <s> There are hundreds of other hotels I would stay in over this one . ' </s> 
<s> I booked a hotel room for 4 nights at this hotel through an online vendor . </s> <s> After booking the hotel room I contacted the hotel to request a room with 2 beds . </s> <s> I was told in 3 different conversations with hotel personnel that I would have a room with 2 double beds . </s> <s> When I arrived I was given a King sized bed and was told that there was nothing the hotel could do for myself and my 3 guests . </s> <s> Apparently the hotel management saw no problem with 4 people sleeping in 1 bed . </s> <s> The staff was completely unaccomodating . </s> <s> To add insult to injury we met other guests that had obtained a room with 2 beds by just walking in off the street the day after we checked in . </s> <s> I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . </s> <s> The customer service is well below what is acceptable . </s> <s> The location of the hotel is great but there are many other hotels that offer excellent service and high quality rooms to stay in while visiting Chicago . </s> <s> Bottom line is do NOT stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker ! ! !

<s> It has been a couple of years since I stayed here ; and got it for a night last weekend on Hotwire . </s> <s> I paid only $100 and stayed a Saturday night . </s> <s> I was very impressed with the redecorating done to the hotel . </s> <s> The lobby has always been great ; but the rooms were a little shabby in the past . </s> <s> Not any more ; as the hotel has been redecorated in the last few years . </s> <s> The location is still amazing ; and with the Berghoff open again ; there is a great restaurant within walking distance .

<s> The room itself was fine and comfortable 'very peaceful ' ; but the customer service by the so-called ; concierge or " experience something or the others " left much to be desired . </s> <s> First ; I arrived and the doorman walked me to the desk . </s> <s> I was not greeted with the usual " Hello ; welcome to . . . " . </s> <s> Instead ; I got ; " Your name ? </s> <s> ID ?

<s> Just spent three nights at the Amalfi Hotel ; while in Chicago on business . </s> <s> Booked a king-corner room and loved it . </s> <s> Largest room I 've ever had in a hotel in Chicago ; incredibly comfortable ; very clean . </s> <s> The breakfast and evening cocktails were a nice bonus too . </s> <s> And the location couldn 't be beat . </s> <s> Walking distance to the the River ; the Loop ; Michigan Ave shopping and convenient to public transportation . </s> <s> I noticed a number of reviews commented on the noise ; yes there is some street noise ; and the building across the street is under construction 'the noise from that was usually between 730-4 ; if you want to sleep late during the week ask for a room on the back side ' but really ; in downtown Chicago it 's not going to be silent ; if you want silence stay in the suburbs . </s> <s> If you want a great hotel 'at a great price ' right in the thick of everything ; stay at the Amalfi . ' </s> 
<s> To start with ; this hotel had the worst customer service . </s> <s> They were impossible to work with on EVERYTHING ! </s> <s> Now ; the problems we had in chronological order . </s> <s> First ; we arrive at 8 PM Sat . </s> <s> to check in . </s> <s> They did not have the room with 2 beds we had reserved available ; so they offered us a room with one bed and a rollaway 'free of charge ' . </s> <s> However ; the room was not ready yet . </s> <s> Finally at 10 . 30 ! </s> <s> '2 . 5 hrs later ' we were able to get our room keys . </s> <s> But ; there was no rollaway . </s> <s> Another 30 mins and 3 phone calls later ; we had a rollaway ; but had to get the charge waived a second time . </s> <s> Now we go to check out on Mon . </s> <s> and they couldn 't print us a bill or give us a total . </s> <s> We stop 3 hrs down the road to get gas only to find out that our bank card had been overdrawn $2 ; 127 . 00 ! </s> <s> We called the bank and found out the hotel had ran our card through 3 TIMES ; for $709 each ; when our bill was supposed to be $450 . </s> <s> After sitting at the gas station on the phone for 1 . 5hrs ; the money was finally put back in our account so we could continue our trip home . </s> <s> I would recommend a Holiday Inn over the Intercontinental any day .

<s> This is about the fourth time we stayed at the Allegro . </s> <s> The previous times ; I have nothing but good to say about the Allegro . </s> <s> But my reaction has soured on this place . </s> <s> We have stayed here the past few years on the first weekend in December as a kick off to the holiday season and our shopping . </s> <s> From the very start ; this year was a disappointment . </s> <s> I had checked the deals on a number of sites before calling the Allegro . </s> <s> I was quoted one price 'higher than what was on line ' ; when I mentioned this ; I was told I could have the lower price . </s> <s> At check in ; the desk was nice but not friendly . </s> <s> We discovered that our room was not as good as in the past 'punishment for asking for a lower price ? ' </s> <s> The closet had no hangers ; we had no place to put our suitcase . </s> <s> No one mentioned the wine reception in the evening . </s> <s> On the second day ; we discovered that even our bath mat for the shower was missing . </s> <s> It took two phone calls and almost two hours to get a new one . </s> <s> I wrote the management following our stay . </s> <s> I have yet to receive a reply . </s> <s> Needless to say we will be looking elsewhere when we go into the city the next time . </s> <s> I would advise others to do the same .

<s> I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel ; after hearing all the good things about it . </s> <s> Unfortunately ; it was a very underwhelming experience ; to say the least . </s> <s> But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel . </s> <s> First off ; it is located my favorite part of Chicago - the leafy ; affluent part of town that is Chicago 's equivalent of Manhattan 's Upper East Side ; complete with sidewalks ; quiet tree-lined streets ; real old-school townhouses 'instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums ' ; cute boutiques 'instead of Gap ; Banana Republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands ' and ; of course ; Hermes of Paris 'which warrants a separate mention ' . </s> <s> I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches ; cherry colored wooden furnitures ; area rugs and distinct artwork . </s> <s> The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains . </s> <s> I definitely love the room . </s> <s> While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan ; getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task . </s> <s> So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous ; ample bathroom ; double sink ; massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around ; do a chicken dance ; and strut my Herve and Louboutins in . </s> <s> My only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room ; but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us ; so can 't have it all ! </s> <s> Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service ; or lack thereof . </s> <s> I mean ; seriously . </s> <s> They don 't call it the 'hospitality ' industry for no reason . </s> <s> I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say ; a 3000-room Vegas hotel . </s> <s> First ; I called in to reconfirm my reservation . </s> <s> The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent . </s> <s> First off ; she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff ; to whom I had to explain myself all over again 'my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service ' . </s> <s> The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly ; nor was he at all competent either . </s> <s> Case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in ; which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there . </s> <s> But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1AM . </s> <s> As a general rule ; I am never ; ever ; a big fan of room service ; having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity ; 10 . 5% tax 'and still expect a tip ' on during my days globetrotting on the company 's expense account . </s> <s> Think overcooked steaks ; lukewarm soup ; bread hard enough to knock someone out ; and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite . </s> <s> So I really wasn 't expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24-hour room service ; but lo and behold ; they do . </s> <s> I placed an order of chicken BLT ; which 'to my initial delight ' came in within 20 minutes . </s> <s> Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $2 on top of the 18% service fee 'refer above ' I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin ; microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lay 's chips 'lightly salted flavor ' . </s> <s> The bread looked like someone stomped on it ; the L and T looked like it was 2 days old ; the B was unrecognizable ; and the chicken was burnt and cold . </s> <s> It was pathetic room service at its finest . </s> <s> We did get the item taken off our bill 'rightfully so too ' but the front desk person was ; instead of apologetic ; defiant . </s> <s> The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving ; it 's quite an accomplishment in and of itself . </s> <s> We won 't be coming back ; unfortunately .

<s> The Hard Rock hotel is great for a relaxing getaway . </s> <s> The rooms are quiet ; the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is a nice size . </s> <s> We had fabulous service and got a great rate . </s> <s> Other than the fact that there were no bathrobes 'it 's listed as an amenity ' and the Sony radio didn 't work ; it was perfect . </s> <s> Would definitely stay there again !

<s> I chose this hotel for a nice weekend getaway and was nothing but disappointed . </s> <s> The previous weekend ; I stayed at a 2 . 5 star hotel a few blocks away ; and was much more impressed there . </s> <s> The Hard Rock had a number of issues including : very dark room - not much light 'artificial or natural ' ; lots of street noise ; very cheap decor and furniture ; broken cabinet door ; very warm room - said they would send maintenance ; but they never arrived ; had bar charges on account that were not ours . </s> <s> Overall ; I was very surprised that this was a 4 star hotel . </s> <s> I expected a much better experience ! ' </s> 
<s> Not worth the price . </s> <s> We almost stayed at a hotel for $110 a night ; but instead choose the Hard Rock for $180 'a special ' . </s> <s> We were located on the " newly renovated " Beatles floor . </s> <s> The carpets in the hallways looked like they needed to be replaced . </s> <s> Upon entering our room we found some cool Beatles artwork along with a 3x4 foot Marilyn Manson portrait . </s> <s> I think they were halfway done re theming the room . </s> <s> At checkout they tried to charge us $11 for using the mini-bar which we didn 't even open . </s> <s> They removed the charge right away but I wonder if they try to get unsuspecting people with that charge . </s> <s> Nothing special here . </s> <s> If you want to pay a bunch extra for some light theming then this is the place for you .

<s> My wife and I just spent the Labor Day weekend in the city ; choosing the Hard Rock Hotel as our pad . </s> <s> We 've stayed at the HRH in Orlando twice and are blown away by the ambience there . </s> <s> It 's not that way here . </s> <s> These may be all ticky tacky things ; but they added up to us . </s> <s> First of all ; the room . </s> <s> We upgraded our reservation thru the HRH website for a room with " an Incredible view " . </s> <s> Well ; our 9th floor view was of nothing more than the venting on top of the building next to us . </s> <s> That was all we could see . </s> <s> So there was no view . </s> <s> The room was muggy . </s> <s> We had the air turned down all the way and it never got below 74 . </s> <s> We woke up sweaty both days . </s> <s> When we opened the window to get a breeze ; the noise from the rooftop next to us was overbearing . </s> <s> The room was small and dark ; but it didn 't bother us that much . </s> <s> The bed may have been the mosr comfortable bed I ever slept in . </s> <s> And we even joked about stealing the pillows ! </s> <s> We had the same issue with the honor bar as a previous poster ; but they removed the charges no prob . </s> <s> Throughout the entire hotel ; I counted a total of 3 pieces of music memorabilia . </s> <s> I thought it was a pretty cheesy attempt to renovate an old hotel ; throw a Styx guitar on the wall ; and slap a HRH emblem on the outside . </s> <s> The hotel itself was very clean and did not look like a renovation . </s> <s> The location is good ; right on the south end of the mag mile ; but there are 10-15 better hotels in a better location to shopping ; quality eats ; and Navy Pier . </s> <s> If you have a car ; parking will cost you $38 'day ; which is prob normal for downtown . </s> <s> The hotel restaurant was a Chinese restaurant . </s> <s> The bar was small and trendy ; and I guess the kicker to it all was that my wife tried to order a Pina Colada and they told us they didn 't have a blender . </s> <s> WHAAT ? ? ? ? </s> <s> A HRH without a blender ? </s> <s> Did they not know that Jimmy Buffet was in town ? ? ? ? </s> <s> Mind blowing ! </s> <s> I would never ; never ; never go back here . </s> <s> Like I said ; there are many better hotels in much better locations . </s> <s> I will stay at the HRH in Orlando or elsewhere again .

<s> We booked through a travel website . </s> <s> This hotel is currently undergoing major renovation and will be renamed in September . </s> <s> The public areas are still being renovated but the hallways and rooms are done . </s> <s> The hallway was so dimly lit ; we couldn 't see how to use the key card . </s> <s> The shock came when we entered the room . </s> <s> Whoever designed it obviously did not take function or a guest 's comfort into consideration . </s> <s> The bed was a mere 15 inches off the ground - a mattress 'rock hard ' over a platform . </s> <s> The " nigh stands " were shelves attached to the wall at around 12 inches height . </s> <s> The room was stark - all off-white ; no color . </s> <s> No art work or any decoration at all . </s> <s> The full-length drapes completely blocked the air conditioning unit ; if it were winter and the heat was on ; I think this could be dangerous . </s> <s> There was a desk ' chair but no clock 'radio in the room ; there was a wall mounted LCD tv with very poor channel selection . </s> <s> The bathroom was very small but clean . </s> <s> The problem with it was that the tub was almost 2 ft high and difficult to step in to . </s> <s> An older person could have never stayed in the room . </s> <s> Because of the renovation ; there was no restaurant on-site . </s> <s> No vending or ice available on the floor either I can 't see anyone ever becoming a repeat guest at this hotel . </s> <s> I would never stay there again .

<s> Two main issues : '1 ' understaffed from the street to the front desk . </s> <s> Unfortunately I had to drive into the city ; when I arrived there was an excessively long wait for parking . </s> <s> Then inside ; there was a huge queue line with just one clerk working in a big city hotel . </s> <s> Not good 'I will say friendly however ' '2 ' I know this is a big city ; but ; $49 a night to park my car when I 'm staying at that hotel ? </s> <s> Really ? ? </s> <s> That 's unreasonable and a bit gouging in my opinion . </s> <s> Again ; I realize this is Chicago ; but ; I 'm already paying a hefty price for this outdated hotel .

<s> While I had stayed in the Hotel Monaco before ; this was my husband 's first trip to Chicago and I insisted we stay here as I loved it the first time . </s> <s> Well the second stay was even better -- we had one of the corner suites on the river -- the service was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful . </s> <s> The warm cookies in the afternoon is a nice touch after a day of sightseeing . </s> <s> Unfortunately we missed the wine hour . </s> <s> One thing that realy impressed me is that b 'c of flight delays we got to Chicago a day late -- Hotel Monaco manager waived the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a guaranteed reservation .

<s> This hotel is trading on the Hilton name and although adequate the decor is dated and depressing . </s> <s> Although classed as a three star the prices do not reflect this . </s> <s> It was more expensive than other four star hotels in the neighbourhood ; The breakfast is poor quality and the room very crowded . </s> <s> All in all the worst hotel we stayed at in a 14 day tour of Canada and the USA . </s> <s> Would not stay there again .

<s> I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting accommodation in Chicago . </s> <s> Ideal position ; lovely quiet rooms ; good facilities ; complimentary breakfast well received and the Manager 's evening drinks reception excellent ; we always tipped the staff who were serving our drinks . </s> <s> The in-house Amalfitini cocktail was very good . </s> <s> The staff were very friendly and helpful . </s> <s> If I ever return to Chicago I would certainly stay there again . </s> <s> Theres nothing bad I can say about this hotel .

<s> I called the reservations line to book a room at the beginning of December 2012 for a rate with a local corporation . </s> <s> When I first made the reservation I did not get an e-mail confirmation . </s> <s> I had to call again to get the e-mail and then saw that I was booked in a handicapped accessible room which i did not need as there was me ; my wife and three year old . </s> <s> I called the reservation line and asked for a regular room which they said was impossible at the rate I was at ; however for ten dollars more I can upgrade to a regular room . </s> <s> I then asked what if a disabled person needs the room and he said he could not help me . </s> <s> i told them to cancel the room . </s> <s> based on the reservation experience ; I did not want to run into anymore trouble at this hotel .

<s> My family of four went to a convention and stayed here in early August . </s> <s> We were promised a room with two double beds . </s> <s> When we arrived 'earlier than most ' we were told they were 45 double beds short . </s> <s> We reluctantly agreed to take a room with a king bed and a promise of a roll away bed . </s> <s> We had a to sleep very uncomfortably with a 12 year old in our bed and our other child in the roll away . </s> <s> Little did we know we were being CHARGED a daily fee for this bed . </s> <s> The managment could not handle the large group that was at this hotel . </s> <s> The bellhops and bartenders were visibly stressed and we did not have towels one day until very late at night . </s> <s> The managers would not take off the roll away bed charge and were not the least bit accomodating . </s> <s> We were so disappointed in this hotel . </s> <s> Also ; they do not have a pool here . </s> <s> If you want to use a pool there is a health club next to the hotel but you have to pay $20 a day to use it . </s> <s> $80 for a family to take a little swim was a bit ridiculous . </s> <s> Do yourself a favor ; if you want to be accomodated and are thinking of booking this hotel for a convention or otherwise ; go elsewhere . </s> <s> Chicago has too many hotels to choose from to pick this one . </s> <s> I never heard back from managment on this issue when I called and emailed so obviously they don 't care ; even when I told them I 'd write a review on this website . </s> <s> Chicago is an awesome city though . </s> <s> We loved it !

<s> First of all ; Expedia . com charged me for an additional person per my instructions but when I arrived at the Hotel these monies were not included and the complimentary breakfast was not offered . </s> <s> The Hotel service person who checked us in forgot to give me back my parking ticket but left a generic message for me stating that there was an envelope at the front desk . </s> <s> I had to wait in line for another 20 minutes to discover this the whole time this person was looking at me and never said a word ! ! </s> <s> I was charged and paid for parking adjacent to the Hotel . </s> <s> When we went to leave the gate would not open . </s> <s> We had to find the parking garage office and the Manager had to call several times over to the Hotel until finally someone picked up . </s> <s> They confirmed my payment and then we were allowed to leave the structure . </s> <s> The Hotel itself is beautiful ! ! ! </s> <s> The bell hops and doormen were just wonderful . </s> <s> They were more than helpful and gracious but the internal staff were rude and not helpful at all ! ! ! !

<s> My wife and I spent several nights here on a getaway excursion . </s> <s> I didn 't choose it -- Priceline gave it to me for $70 . </s> <s> If I 'd paid the book rate ; $175 ; I 'd have been less pleased . </s> <s> No troubles with checkin . </s> <s> Very small room but bed was clean and comfortable . </s> <s> Starbucks in the lobby was a godsend . </s> <s> I 'd read horror stories about the staff but they seemed friendly enough . </s> <s> For $70 ; it 's a steal . </s> <s> For its online face value ; not so much . </s> <s> Will definitely return if can get similar price .

' </s> <s> . </s> <s> The food is very bad . </s> <s> Very . </s> <s> Bad . </s> <s> There are so many restaurants in this city . </s> <s> Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else to eat . </s> <s> Its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels : Based on my review of everything else . </s> <s> Go to the Drake ; or the Peninsula . </s> <s> Completely worth the extra money . . . </s> <s> That ; or downgrade to the Hilton and get what you expect and pay for . . . </s> <s> The InterContinental has fallen so low that you pay a higher price than the Hilton ; but you get a worse experience ! </s> <s> Its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership : I canceled our membership after this disaster . </s> <s> Part of the membership includes early check-in 'granted ; when available ' . . . </s> <s> but our room wasn 't ready until 6pm . </s> <s> This is obviously after normal check-in . </s> <s> The staff was overwhelmed ; and not effective or helpful . </s> <s> I tried to speak with the manager about our room ; waited in long line to speak with someone ; only to be told that my husband needed to be with me because the membership was in his name . </s> <s> In a nutshell . </s> <s> Go somewhere else . </s> <s> ps : Go to Argo tea next door instead of the Starbucks in the hotel . </s> <s> Way better food and coffee .

<s> Got a good deal on a weekend pacage in this Hotel and have to say it is the nicest stay I have had in more than a dozen business trips to Chicago . </s> <s> All rooms are Suites ; staff is friendly and professional ; Restaurant is out of this world and all the extras like a great health club ; turn down service ; complimentary morning beverages delivered to room and on and on . </s> <s> Room was very clean and every need was attended to without feeling intruded on . </s> <s> Will definately stay here again .

<s> This hotel is totally overrated . </s> <s> Yes ; the location is awesome ; but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options . </s> <s> The customer service ; or lack thereof ; was particularly disappointing . </s> <s> Why are they paying anywhere from 2 - 8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady ? </s> <s> Even when her hands are full . </s> <s> The housekeeping staff couldn 't figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip -every day . </s> <s> Why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you don 't bring it anyway . </s> <s> As stated previously ; the location is great . </s> <s> Location ; however ; does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff . </s> <s> I would not stay here again .

<s> We booked at another hotel a block away and spent a unhappy night . </s> <s> We walked over to the Talbott and the courtiest staff showed us a room and we booked the rest of our stay . </s> <s> The room was very attractive and well furnished with double sinks in the bathroom . </s> <s> The tub is large and the shower a pleasure . </s> <s> The location was quiet as requested . </s> <s> The staff was always cheerful and very helpful . </s> <s> Tim and Stephanie provide excellent concierge services ! </s> <s> The breakfast at the Basil Cafe is a great way to start the day . </s> <s> We travel a lot and appreciate the ambiance of a good hotel . </s> <s> I would highly recommend the Talbott for your stay .

<s> We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend . </s> <s> We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10 : 00 a . m . ; and they were able to give us our rooms early . </s> <s> Hooray ! </s> <s> We were on the 5th floor 'Beatles theme ' . </s> <s> The rooms were very comfortable . </s> <s> One of our rooms was on a corner ; and had lots of windows . </s> <s> The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows . </s> <s> Not a great view from our side of the hotel ; but we didn 't pay for a room with a view . </s> <s> The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable ; the bathroom was full of Aveda products ; and there was a bathrobe in the closet . </s> <s> The tv 'dvd 'stereo combo was nice ; but we weren 't in the room a lot to use it . </s> <s> We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks 'drinks as they were weighted and we 'd be charged . </s> <s> No problems there . </s> <s> We did not make use of the free fitness center ; because the weather was perfect . </s> <s> My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead . </s> <s> He said it was wonderful . </s> <s> We did use the free internet in our rooms . </s> <s> It was 'wired ' internet ; but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway . </s> <s> The room was a bit dim at night ; but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps . </s> <s> There was virtually no hall ' elevator noise . </s> <s> The location of the Hard Rock is ideal . </s> <s> It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery ; just blocks to either Grant Park ; The Art Institute ; State Street Shopping ; or Michigan Ave . </s> <s> To sum up ; there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about . </s> <s> We would be glad to stay here again any time . ' </s> 
<s> Move beyond the rock theme and it 's an average hotel with a good location . </s> <s> Room was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing . </s> <s> Thank goodness the window opened or we 'd have been cooked alive . </s> <s> That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave . </s> <s> This combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting . </s> <s> Room was stuffy too . </s> <s> Burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions . </s> <s> Wife happy w ' Aveda in bath . </s> <s> Base bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey .

<s> Not impressed at ALL . </s> <s> The hotel itself looks really nice ; especially in the big foyer area . </s> <s> Our room was small ; and the bathroom needed some major upgrades . </s> <s> It had the green tile ; like at your grandmother 's house ; all over the walls ; and 2 people couldn 't fit in it if you tried . </s> <s> We could hear the people beside us in the early morning every morning ; so obvioulsy the walls aren 't so thick . </s> <s> Our room looked directly on to a brick building outside ; VERY close ; we couldn 't even tell if it was nice outside or not . </s> <s> We are assuming we were not in a renovated room from the looks of it ; and I felt yucky the whole time in it . </s> <s> I just wouldn 't pay lots of money to stay here ; there is nothing exceptional about it at all .

<s> We paid $75 a night through Priceline ; which is excellent for June . </s> <s> Our room had a fantastic view of the Hancock Building and the river . </s> <s> The room was large ; clean and had a couch ; easy chair and desk chair . </s> <s> The bedding was the newer 'non-bedspread ' style ; the bed was comfortable ; the bathroom was large and ; well ; we were pleased with the room and the Hyatt in every way . </s> <s> We ate at the lobby restaurant ; which is attractively decorated and was bustling with activity when we were there . </s> <s> We only got Cobb Salads ; so I don 't know if the food ; in general ; is good or not . </s> <s> The Cobb was so-so . </s> <s> Our only complaint was the $48 fee to park your car over-night and the $13 daily fee for the internet . </s> <s> Many places are offering free internet these days and I wish the Hyatt would hop on board with this concept . </s> <s> We hated to leave !

<s> Beautiful historic hotel -- and since I 'm in historic building business ; was looking forward to stay . </s> <s> Moved rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite ; they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up -- duct work torn apart in bathroom ; lamp fixtures literally falling off wall ; mirror torn off wall ; etc . </s> <s> Ended up in a room on 20th floor -- much nicer ; but yesterday waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions . </s> <s> Only two of three elevators to top floors work -- and these two elevators skip floors ; so you can be stuck waiting for ever . </s> <s> When I raised this to hotel staff ; was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it . </s> <s> Umm ; no . </s> <s> This is not an old building problem ; this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it . </s> <s> Thumbs way down ; stay away . </s> <s> Go to the Drake or Knickerbocker if you 're looking for old world charm ; sans hassle .

<s> The hotel lost our reservations and then couldin 't accommodate what we needed . </s> <s> they gave us a room much smaller than we needed and when we requested something diffrerent they were unable to fulfill our request . </s> <s> we opted to leave the hotel and after there mistake of losing our reservations ; they still charged us an early check out fee . </s> <s> If it wasn 't for the great location of the hotel ; there would be nothing positive to say ' '

<s> We stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in early December ; we stay there that weekend every December and we think it is the best location in the city for us . </s> <s> We like State Street better than Michigan Avenue and the Palmer House is right there . </s> <s> We stayed in the Towers ; in a room with two double beds and 2 baths . </s> <s> The room was not huge ; but very comfortable . </s> <s> The towers area was recently refurbished and it shows ; the lobby is beautiful with plasma screen TVs on the walls ; comfortable chairs and tables and a seperate room for the food 'drinks . </s> <s> There is a continental breakfast in the morning ; appetizers during cocktail hour and cookies are laid out until the room closes . </s> <s> There is a fridge stocked with soft drinks ; water and juice that are yours for the taking . </s> <s> We were very pleased with the upgraded Towers ; everyone should check it out !

<s> IMO the Amalfi doesnt come close to justifying the glowing comments on TA . </s> <s> This is basically a Holiday Inn . </s> <s> Half of the rooms overlook an alley ' loading dock . </s> <s> The hotel is not more than 6 or 7 flors high and the garbage pick up woke me up daily at 5 am . </s> <s> At 530 ; when you are just nodding off again ; they begin setting up for the complimentary breakfast . </s> <s> This is a continental buffet on every floor next to the elevator bank . </s> <s> Any room within 100 feet of the elevators will hear the noise . </s> <s> Reception was a bit tacky and the " staff " was a little rough around the edges . </s> <s> I didn 't see a single business travellers while I was there . </s> <s> Valet parking was expensive 'usual for Chicago ' but was very slow . </s> <s> Just ok . </s> <s> Explore other options .

<s> We got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in Chicago on 7 '24 '09 . </s> <s> We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $69 'normal rate was around $200 ' . </s> <s> The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed . </s> <s> Hotel is only about 1 . 5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient . </s> <s> Parking is very expensive at $50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $30 . </s> <s> We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere . </s> <s> We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict . </s> <s> They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we didn 't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast . </s> <s> Glad we didn 't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better . </s> <s> I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit .

<s> This hotel was magnificent ! </s> <s> Not only was it a mini palace ; but the staff was polite ; helpful ; and professional . </s> <s> In an e-mail I received before we left for Chicago ; the concierge ; Les ; offered to get us tickets ; directions ; reservations to anything we 'd like to see 'do . </s> <s> He also got us an upgrade on our room ; and when someone rudely butted in line as we were registering ; the registry person said they would upgrade our room just for that . </s> <s> And so we were granted a beautiful suite complete with king size bed and jacuzzi . </s> <s> The bed and the linens were so comfortably both of us slept late every morning !

<s> Spent two nights at the InterContinental on a business trip . </s> <s> This is a tremendous ; towering hotel in one of the best locations in Chicago -- right on the Magnificent Mile and superbly convenient for shopping and well placed for the business area . </s> <s> My room was in the Historic Tower -- a 1920s Masonic Club which has been converted at enormous expense . </s> <s> The effort has been worthwhile . </s> <s> My room was very large and well furnished ; with a beautiful bathroom which contained a separate shower cubicle . </s> <s> It had breathtaking views down Michigan Avenue . </s> <s> There is a superb recreation centre 'with an impressive swimming pool ' beautiful bars and a good restaurant ; Zest ; that serves a great breakfast . </s> <s> There is wifi in the rooms '$9 . 95 per day ' and tea and coffee making facilities . </s> <s> No trouser press ; but there is an ironing board and iron . </s> <s> The staff is friendly and anxious to please . </s> <s> I recommend this hotel in the strongest possible terms . </s> <s> It 's expensive ; but it will be difficult to find a better one in Chicago .

<s> We got a great deal on this hotel ; just $91 found through travelzoo . </s> <s> We only stayed one night ; but were very impressed . </s> <s> The sevice was fantastic from the moment we stepped up to the property . </s> <s> The hotel smelled wonderful and was immaculate . </s> <s> Our room ; while not enormous was perfect . </s> <s> We had a great view of the city and lake . </s> <s> The bed was extremely comfortable . </s> <s> We never heard any noise outside of our room . </s> <s> The bathroom was nice sized considering we must have had one of the smaller rooms in the hotel ; two could get ready very comfortably . </s> <s> Location was perfect ; just off Michigan Ave and steps away from Millenium Park . </s> <s> We would definetly stay here again ; especially if we could get this great deal !

<s> We planned to stay for 5 nights on a family trip . </s> <s> I booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast - get a quick bite ; then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff . </s> <s> Well ; our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly ; and thankfully ; switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights . </s> <s> The room was dirty . </s> <s> When we opened the sofabed ; the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out . </s> <s> Ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used ; and theoretically cleaned ; a lot . </s> <s> Extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms weren 't much better . </s> <s> Temperature control in the room was imprecise - minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night ; it made for a cold stay . </s> <s> If you like to eat for free 'they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights ' and don 't care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer ; I guess some may find this place tolerable . </s> <s> But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral . </s> <s> The only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area 'we switched to The James and had a great experience ' . </s> <s> I couldn 't be paid to stay here again . </s> <s> I 'm shocked by the high overall rating given our experience .

<s> This hotel has the worst rooms we have stayed in during the last 10 years . </s> <s> The first room they gave us was a shock . </s> <s> TINY and the bathroom was a joke ; ; you had to step inside ; move out of the way just to shut the door . </s> <s> The furniture is disgusting and all the wood trim was VERY beat up and painted over about 100 times . </s> <s> so they transfered us to the 'executive suite ' That room had a tiny bathroom . . </s> <s> I mean TINY ! </s> <s> The furniture was hideous and dirty . </s> <s> It was on the 3rd level so you heard every conversation on the street below and traffic was loud . </s> <s> The only impressive part is the lobby . . </s> <s> but don 't be fooled . </s> <s> because after that . . </s> <s> the floors above look like they need a major overhaul . . </s> <s> and the rooms were not worth even $100 per night . </s> <s> we stayed there a year ago because we got stuck through Priceline deal . </s> <s> I don 't think we want to do Priceline again only because they have the Knickerbocker as a 4 star Hotel and we don 't ever want to go back there again . </s> <s> 2 Stars at best for the dumpy Knickerbocker . </s> <s> They should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing guests to stay in those rooms . </s> <s> Boomer . </s> <s> Naperville ; IL '
<s> I have stayed at the James a few times ; it is my go to hotel in Chicago . </s> <s> This last trip makes me think it is time to start looking for other options . </s> <s> The Good : Location is awesome ; just off Michigan Ave ; Trader Joe 's across street for some healthier snacking . </s> <s> It is a great location ; easy to walk most anywhere . </s> <s> The door staff are very friendly and helpful . </s> <s> The overall feeling is modern ; upbeat . </s> <s> Turn down service with cookie is nice . </s> <s> Free Wifi 'which worked to varying degrees throughout stay ' The Bad : They claim to be a 4 . 5 star hotel ; which to me ; means better then a 4 star and online with a 5 star 'without a pool ' . </s> <s> They used to have Kiehls toiletries and now have " Harmony " brand . </s> <s> Additionally ; they now have the large bottles attached to the wall which you get to share with the other guests that stayed in the room before you . </s> <s> It is what I would expect from Holiday Inn or my gym ; but not a 4 . 5 star hotel . </s> <s> I asked about the switch 'mainly because when I booked they still had Kiehls in website description ' and they claimed that the reason they went the communal bottle route was to be " green " . </s> <s> That is hard to believe ; as it 's not like the hotel is making other efforts to be green 'they still have incandescent light bulbs ; housekeeping leaves the lights and radio on when they do turn down ; they don 't recycle in room ; etc ' . </s> <s> They are obviously trying to cut costs ; and it shows . </s> <s> More : the rooms are in need of some updating ; they are looking somewhat tired . </s> <s> My third floor room was quite loud with the motorcyclers trying to prove their manhood out front 'not their fault ' . </s> <s> Don 't take the stairs 'as the stairwell is straight out of horror movie ' ; even though the wait for one of the two elevators might be awhile . </s> <s> The phone staff was fairly rude 'granted ; they didn 't like me questioning their toiletry change ' . </s> <s> I feel bad giving such a low rating ; but it really did not come close to my expectations 'from previous stays there ' . </s> <s> I will start trying out new hotels in the area .

<s> Stayed with a group for a bachelorette party ; and was disappointed . </s> <s> The hotel is beautiful ; the staff was all rather friendly . </s> <s> The main problem was the room 'sleeping situation . </s> <s> We had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before ; but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out 'how that happens I don 't know ! !

<s> The hotel is almost always very helpful . </s> <s> This stay caused me to re-think if I like the Palmer House . </s> <s> I had dirty covers for the bed . </s> <s> It was also the smallest room in the hotel I am sure . </s> <s> My husband and I usually come 8 times each year . </s> <s> He is there doing Business and CTA work . </s> <s> We are not pleased with the size of the room at all now . </s> <s> Rooms have always had two chairs ; desk ; and usually 22 by 25 feet . </s> <s> Not this room on the 11th floor . </s> <s> It was only 15 X 17 approx . </s> <s> The service men at the doors have always said a welcome but not this time . </s> <s> In the past we had a bell man steal a $300 . </s> <s> pair of sun glasses and the hotel did nothing about our loss financially .

<s> This is a great find for downtown Chicago . </s> <s> The price is right and the staff are excellent . </s> <s> As noted ; there is construction going on around the hotel ; but I didn 't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping . </s> <s> I asked for a quiet room on an upper floor ; and was gladly given one . </s> <s> The lobby is small ; the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel . </s> <s> The concierge ; Stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations 'along with a complimentary appetizer ' . </s> <s> We had a standard room ; and it was spacious ; tastefully decorated--everything we needed . </s> <s> The bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking--and the MP3 compatible radio was a nice perk . </s> <s> Just can 't say enough about how nice the staff are--every single person you meet . </s> <s> Would definitely stay here again .

<s> We also just returned from a frigid weekend in Chicago . </s> <s> I booked the Ambassador East because of its great rate ; $89 . 00 with my AAA card and we were delighted . </s> <s> Yes ; the rooms show some signs of wear ; but the warmth and charm far make up for it . </s> <s> This was such a pleasant change from the sleek ; modern look of many other chain and boutique hotels . </s> <s> We became members of the I preferred program and were therefore eligible for an upgrade which we automatically got upon check in . </s> <s> We had a lovely suite with lots of sitting room and a comfortable bedroom and bathroom . </s> <s> We had wonderful food at the Pump Room which is classic . </s> <s> Our oatmeal there was so tastefully served ; I 'd love to have some right now ! </s> <s> The location was great . </s> <s> Had it been normal winter weather ; we could have easily walked to Michigan Avenue for shopping ; but due to the minus 20 degree windchills ; we opted for a cab which was less than a $5 . 00 fare . </s> <s> We also enjoyed a glass of wine around the fireplace in the lobby and found it so welcoming and cozy and not overcrowed at all . </s> <s> We would definitely stay here again !

<s> We had an issue with housekeeping and the hotel management did not handle it well . </s> <s> They were subject to a brief staff strike and did not inform guests and in fact failed to tell us about the strike and our room never was cleaned . </s> <s> After 4 calls and several hours we were able to get clean towels . </s> <s> Overall service other than check in was poor for a reportedly 4 star hotel .

<s> Check-in was fast ; the room was perfect ; and there were no problems . </s> <s> This is a standard big-city business hotel with every amenity imaginable . </s> <s> I got a very good deal for a one-night stay ; but they made the money back from the exorbitant parking rate and the absurd access fee for wireless internet . </s> <s> If you are bored of the routine hotel fare ; walk two blocks to Gourmet Pantry '155 N . </s> <s> Michigan ' for a refreshing change .

<s> My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in mid-October . </s> <s> We decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of Chicago in a week . </s> <s> I 'll start out by saying that this was a great experience . </s> <s> At check-in ; I indicated that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite . </s> <s> The Ambassador East is probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from the North end of the Magnificent Mile . </s> <s> It is also just a 2 or 3 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on Rush . </s> <s> Our room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed . </s> <s> Our suite 'on the 3rd floor ' had two very large closets ; a large " living room " and a large bedroom . </s> <s> The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough . </s> <s> If I would have payed full price for this suite ; I probably would have given it a rating of 4 ; but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and I had such a great time here ; I decided to give it a five . </s> <s> It is also worth mentioning that the concierge was very helpful . </s> <s> My wife and I decided to eat at The Pump Room restaurant ; but we were not very impressed . </s> <s> We found the food and service mediocre . </s> <s> The atmosphere was probably pretty neat when Sinatra used to eat there back in the day ; but not anymore . </s> <s> Although we were unimpressed by the Pump Room ; the staff were kind enough to seat us in the " Sinatra Booth " which was back in a corner and enclosed by curtains . </s> <s> That neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here . </s> <s> The Ambassador East is an older hotel ; but it is in a charming older neighborhood . </s> <s> The staff 's kindness and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me . </s> <s> When we are in Chicago again ; we will definitely consider staying at the Ambassador East again .

<s> My wife and I came to spend the weekend in downtown Chicago for shopping and we found this Conrad hotel well located close to everything downtown and of a size that doesn 't make you feel lost in the Convention world . </s> <s> We have had this feeling when staying at larger hotels in the past . </s> <s> Our Suite has view on Michigan avenue with a bit of the Lake at the end . </s> <s> Staff was very professional ; pleasant and friendly making us feel very comfortable . </s> <s> Internet is free n the rooms and I am making my review from there . ' </s> 
<s> My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience . </s> <s> The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location . </s> <s> It 's in a quiet location ; yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to . </s> <s> We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost . </s> <s> It didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have ; but it was elegantly appointed ; spacious ; and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet . </s> <s> The service was amazing . </s> <s> Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful ; as well as knowledgeable . </s> <s> This was true from the doormen at the front ; to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant . </s> <s> Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions ; and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out . </s> <s> The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel ; this goes for the room service as well . </s> <s> Dinner there was good ; but not great . </s> <s> I mentioned almost flawless ; as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel . </s> <s> It involved scheduling and was aggravating ; as the hotel actively encourages its use . </s> <s> However ; Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied ; following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with . </s> <s> The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly . </s> <s> Overall ; we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits . ' </s> 
<s> We were disappointed with this hotel . </s> <s> The staff seems hurried and unhelpful . </s> <s> Our room was not made up until after 5 PM despite several requests . </s> <s> The blower in the hallway blew freezing air ; but the staff told us that there was nothing that could be done about it . </s> <s> The lobby is not inviting and there is no where comfortable to sit . </s> <s> The room and bed was comfortable ; but the cream and and modern art work are not our style . </s> <s> The room lacked many of the amenities other hotels in this price range offer . </s> <s> Certainly not worth the rate compared to other hotels I have stayed at in Chicago . ' </s> 
<s> My wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago and had an okay experience . </s> <s> The location contrary to other reviews is not very good for a downtown Chicago hotel . </s> <s> Everything is at least a fifteen minute walk which in the winter in Chicago means a taxi ride . </s> <s> The other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere . </s> <s> I don 't necessarily mind people smoking but the lobby ; the elevator lobbies and any area that was public had tons of people smoking and ashtrays everywhere . </s> <s> The pool 'spa 'excercise room was not very impressive either . </s> <s> It is accessible by walking through the business center corridor ; wondering if you 're going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small . </s> <s> There is also no hot tub and the " spa " is a closet with a massage table . </s> <s> The concierge was helpful but the people that answer the " sheraton promise " phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors . </s> <s> The beds were super comfortable . </s> <s> I think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for couples or families you can do MUCH better in downtown Chicago . ' </s> 
<s> I booked this hotel with great expectations . </s> <s> I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago . </s> <s> Upon arriving to the hotel 'at the exact time I indicated in my reservation ' I was told I 've been " downgraded " to a lesser quality room . </s> <s> I travel very often and never had this before . </s> <s> Moreover ; I did not hear a single " I 'm sorry " ; it was like usual business . </s> <s> What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me " I will decrease the rate for you " " what do you think ; nice eh ? " like he was doing me a favor ! ! ! ! </s> <s> They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course 'which is the legal thing to do ; since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money ' . </s> <s> They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value . </s> <s> I did not know what to say ; since this never happened to me before ; also with family present did not want to start arguing . </s> <s> The rooms were nice 'not as nice as I thought ' and location is good ; however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this . </s> <s> That is enough for me not to go back again . ' </s> 
<s> The Allegro in downtown Chicago is a great stay ' part of the Kimpton Group boutique hotels the Allegro offers a classy stay in a beautiful room for a moterate price ' they offer complimentary and decent wine gratis in the late afternoon and the hotel allows you access to everything the loop has to offer in this remarkable city . </s> <s> i would recommend parking outside of the downtown area and taking the 'EL ' into the loop which leaves you about 2 minutes from the hotel ' otherwise you are looking at hefty parking fees for a car you dont need in this part of the city . </s> <s> the rooms are small but beautifully done with great colors ; comfortable beds and in my case great views . </s> <s> if you go to kimpton group website and sign up for specials you will be alerted to great rates on certain days ' kimpton does a great job and their properties are " class acts " '
<s> We usually stay at the Sofitel but thought we would try the Conrad for a change . </s> <s> I don 't think I would rate this hotel over the Sofitel but it was still 1st class . </s> <s> But I do think the service was better at the Conrad . </s> <s> We arrived at the hotel just before the restaurant closed and soon we were the only table left . </s> <s> Normally service goes down hill then but our waiter Eric was the best . </s> <s> Even when I kept ordering my after dinner ports . </s> <s> The meal may not have been The Chop House but it was still very good . </s> <s> The bar was ok ; no Crown Reserve . </s> <s> They did have the Cask 16 at $24 a drink ; ouch . </s> <s> The room service was very quick . </s> <s> Our room was very clean and the maids replace everything including the ashtrays during their visits . </s> <s> The only fault we could find was the temperature on the 14th floor . </s> <s> It was so hot that we had our window open the whole time with the heat turned completely off . </s> <s> Which wasn 't so bad since my wife smokes . </s> <s> The temp on the 5th where the lobby ; bar ; and restaurant was fine . </s> <s> We enjoyed the hotel enough that we will be back in Sept . </s> <s> One last thing ; if you like a cheap fantastic breakfast . </s> <s> Go to the West Egg ; only a few blocks away . ' </s> 
<s> The location is ideal . </s> <s> They have very high ceilings so the rooms appear much larger than they are . </s> <s> The views are great . </s> <s> There were fresh flowers in the bathroom . </s> <s> They had all white bedding . </s> <s> You feel like a princess there . ' </s> 
<s> We booked directly with the Intercontinental--a special room for our wedding night . </s> <s> After our wedding ; we went to the Hotel excited and happy . </s> <s> When we got there ; the night changed . </s> <s> We were treated rudely and with no respect . </s> <s> They told us there was " no room " even though we had a confirmation number . </s> <s> Instead of showing any empathy ; they told us to go sit down while they figured out " what to do with us " . </s> <s> My husband was in his tux and I was in my wedding gown ! </s> <s> No apology ! </s> <s> No concern ! </s> <s> We were given $20 and told to go find a cab and take it to a hotel where they 'd " found " a room . </s> <s> The Intercontinental RUINED our wedding night . </s> <s> We are telling anyone and everyone of our experience . </s> <s> This place was supposed to be elegant . </s> <s> We 've never been treated so poorly . </s> <s> We will never stay in another Intercontinental Hotel and highly recommend you do not contribute to a place that would do this to a newly married couple ! ! ! </s> <s> STEER clear of this place .

<s> I stayed ' Affinia for one night on a purpose not to drive all the way from NW suburbs to Women 's hospital oir my surgery . </s> <s> Few things I really didn 't enjoy - I could hear noise from outside all night long as well as inside noise from slamming doors . No noise insulation at all ! </s> <s> Very dusty between window frames 'I understand - cars ; pollution ' but it looked like it wasn 't cleaned for a very long time . One more thing really made me upset - broken blinds on a right side . </s> <s> I was unable to pull them down to enjoy my sleep time . . . We didn 't notice the problem until very-very late . The Affinia hotel serving tourists and guests of Chicago as well as Northwestern Hospital patients and their families - which really need extra privacy and comfort ! </s> <s> Strange but every hotel I stayed ' was supplied with the SEALED roll of toilet paper . Affinia didn 't even offer that . Looked like someone used a bathroom right after it was taking care of by a cleaning lady ! </s> <s> Neither toilet paper nor toilet seat were sealed for us to use ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! </s> <s> Hopefully ; no more surgeries for me . . . Won 't stay ' this place for leisure - even with discount ! ' </s> 
<s> We got an awesome deal through Priceline for a Friday - Sunday stay at $75 for each night . </s> <s> The hotel is very centrally located on Michigan Avenue " The Magnificent Mile " . </s> <s> You can walk to a ton of shops ' there are plenty of restaurants handy as well . </s> <s> The hotel staff was very friendly ; and the room itself was gorgeous . </s> <s> Very modern decor . </s> <s> Not drab ' typical like most other chain hotels . </s> <s> If staying in Chicago we definitely will be staying there again . </s> <s> Price for valet parking overnight was insane '$42 'day ' ; but what do you expect in a big city .

<s> I have just returned from a lovely shopping trip to Chicago . </s> <s> It is a very nice hotel ; and I will love to stay there if I visit Chicago again ! </s> <s> There is a lot of positive to say about the hotel ; staff is excellent ; never experienced such an excellent service -- that alone is worth coming back for . </s> <s> Was pleasantly surprised that the room rate was including breakfast . </s> <s> A few things that could make this hotel even better . . . </s> <s> A hand shower in the bathroom . </s> <s> The hairdryer to be placed in the bedroom ; instead of the bathroom ; when the bathroom is all damp after a shower I prefer leaving the bathroom to dry my hair . </s> <s> Free internet access in the lobby . </s> <s> I was surprised I had to pay 6 or 7 USD 'for 15 minutes ' to log-on and check-in with my airline 'only with a few airlines you can check-in without paying ? ! ? ! ? ! ?

<s> I stayed at the Allegro for several days in August 2004 and I would defintely stay again . </s> <s> I had a very large room with a huge bathroom ; although the property is a converted theater so the rooms may vary in size and layout . </s> <s> The lobby is comfortable with big sofas and chaise lounges ; a nice place to enjoy the simple '2 choices ; no munchies ' but pleasant wine reception . </s> <s> At night ; there is not much going on in the immediate vicinity ; other than theater traffic ; but it 's a short cab ride to Michigan Avenue shopping and River North restaurants . ' </s> 
<s> I have been 4 times in Chicago ; and I have stayed in 4 different Hotels : This has been for much the very best option . </s> <s> The lobby ; the warm of the receptionist ; the room ; the hotel is very good . </s> <s> It is walking distance to the Magnificent Mile and there 's no chance for you to get lost from this hotel . </s> <s> If you like to travel with style this could be a very good option . ' </s> 
<s> The room was big and luxurious ; befitting the price tag '$299 ' . </s> <s> Bed was very comfortable . </s> <s> However ; my bed was against the wall abutting the elevator shaft ; and I heard the elevators running all night . </s> <s> Also held a one-day conference there for 25 people . </s> <s> They stuck us in a long ; narrow room that was cramped . </s> <s> Also ; the night before we had a pre-conference dinner at the Palm restaurant in the hotel . </s> <s> Service was so slow that some of our party left before entrees were served . </s> <s> And the steaks were only so-so ; a far cry from my experience with other Palms . ' </s> 
<s> A very nice hotel with small but adequate rooms . </s> <s> The decor was lovely . </s> <s> My daughter and I spent 5-nights here ; saw Wicked just down the street and used the public transportation to get all around town . </s> <s> Was a bit disappointed with the bar 'restaurant which opened and closed it 's kitchen at will without regard to posted hours . </s> <s> The room description boasted of safe 's large enough to accomodate a laptop ; so I brought mine . </s> <s> I was informed after check-in that the safes are not in every room 'and not in mine ' . </s> <s> As a side note ; I was surprised that nearly all the shops many restaurants closed at 6pm in that area . . . </s> <s> even the 7-11 . ' </s> 
<s> We attended a Bachorette Party in Chicago in Aug 2005 . </s> <s> There were 10 girls total . </s> <s> We had 5 rooms . . . </s> <s> and I did not hear one complaint from anyone during our entire extended weekend . </s> <s> Never been to Chi-town before ; I booked our hotel based on reviews from TA . </s> <s> And we were not disappointed . </s> <s> The staff is wonderful ; the happy hour was just fabulous . </s> <s> The room was nice and clean ; with a great double headed shower and Aveda products was an extra bonus ! </s> <s> Then you also get free internet in your room ! </s> <s> The hotel was chic and hip without the pretentiousness . </s> <s> We still talk about what a wonderful time we had . . . </s> <s> and we all agree that if we ever go back to Chicago we will be staying at the Amalfi again . </s> <s> Trust me the pics don 't do it justice ! ' </s> 
<s> The room was dingy and run down - it felt like staying in a cheap motel . </s> <s> The carpet was exceptionally worn ; wallpaper peeling ; bathroom grout dingy . </s> <s> The place felt like it hadn 't been redecorated in 30 years . </s> <s> On top of that ; the windows would not open 'not unusual for a hig-rise hotel ' ; and there was no air fan for ac or heat - how the temp control was supposed to work ; I have no idea 'they said 'radient cooling ' whatever that is ' ; but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation . </s> <s> We even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated . </s> <s> So much for privacy . </s> <s> I can 't comment on the food ; because we ate out at every chance . </s> <s> Chicago has some fantastic food ! </s> <s> And much of it within easy distance to the hotel . </s> <s> The hotel is in a good location ; near the waterfront and millenium park ; shopping and dining . </s> <s> The conference facilities were average ; but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was non-existent . </s> <s> I will never stay in this hotel again ; especially for the price ; because of the poor room quality . ' </s> 
<s> This lovely hotel has only six floors ; making it easy to get to elevators and down to reception . </s> <s> The building is dwarfed amongst all the skyscrapers around it . </s> <s> Trump 's huge new tower is just down the street . </s> <s> The Amalfi looks recently refurbished ; very modern ; but warm and inviting . </s> <s> Bedrooms quite spacious with lovely linens and very ; very comfortable beds . </s> <s> Bathroom quite small but roomy enough ; with Aveda tolietries and constant hot water in the showers . </s> <s> Continental style breakfast is set out fresh every morning in front of the elevator of every floor . </s> <s> Great to stumble out of bed and grab a coffee etc 'robes ' slippers provided ' without having to get dressed for a formal breakfast . </s> <s> Really enjoyed the Managers evening cocktail reception ; especially the Amalfitinis . </s> <s> A nice way to relax after a hard days ' shopping ! </s> <s> Location is great for all the shops ; transport ; museums etc . </s> <s> Easy walking to everywhere . </s> <s> Staff also very friendly and welcoming . </s> <s> Would definately stay there again . ' </s> 
<s> My first trip back to Chicago in about 7 years was perfect ! </s> <s> I chose the Knickerbocker as I had read that their rooms were recently renovated on top of being a great location to Michigan Avenue ; Rush Street and downtown Chicago . </s> <s> I must say I was very impressed with the guestrooms ! </s> <s> I had not stayed there prior but it definitely is a refresh from what I 've seen in photo 's posted on the reviews . </s> <s> The guestrooms are nicely decorated with a modern feel and they are good sized for a historical hotel ! </s> <s> The beds are wonderful -- I need to get a pillow top mattress at home ! </s> <s> I used the Internet access with no issue and I LOVED the larger screen TV 's . </s> <s> The shower is fun with the different types of shower heads you can choose . </s> <s> And the bathrooms are fresh with all new granite and tile . </s> <s> I 'm anxious to get back to Chicago and it won 't be 7 years from now ! </s> <s> I would highly recommend this hotel -- fantastic guestrooms ; location and staff ! </s> <s> I 've added some digital pictures of my room as they are completely different from the one 's I saw on previous reviews with the new renovation . ' </s> 
<s> Overall the hotel is very nice . </s> <s> The rooms are spacious and well-appointed ; but they tend to be aging or dated . </s> <s> My bathroom was particularly below average ; with old wallpaper and a dingy tub with a crummy showerhead . </s> <s> The toilet paper roll holder was pulling out of the wall and its screws were exposed . </s> <s> The conceirge recommended an expensive and mediocre restaurant . </s> <s> I hate it when they do that- it makes me suspect they 're getting kickbacks from places that otherwise don 't get enough business on their own . </s> <s> Breakfast was very good . </s> <s> It 's a relatively large european-style spread . ' </s> 
<s> Just got back from 2 days up in Chicago shopping with girlfriends . </s> <s> First time I have stayed at the Omni . </s> <s> I did so because I saw a $129 . 00 rate that included $25 . 00 of free food on Travelzoo . </s> <s> The three of us '55 year olds ' all stayed in one suite with 2 double beds and a VERY comfortable pull out sofa . </s> <s> We had plenty of room . </s> <s> Food in the restaurant was great ; service was outstanding from everone we came into contact with ; early morning delivery of free coffee ; juice and hot chocolate was fabulous and recommendations from the staff on where to eat ; time of movies ; shopping areas ; etc was really helpful . </s> <s> Need I mention the outstanding location ? </s> <s> Simply the best ! </s> <s> We all decided that the Omni is our new favorite hotel . ' </s> 
<s> On our visit to Chicago ; we chose the Hyatt due to its location in downtown ; within walking distance to most major attractions ; such as Sears Tower ; Magnificent Mile ; Grant 'Millenium Parks ; etc . </s> <s> Subway ' bus stops very close by to travel to other locations in the city . </s> <s> Overall the hotel was very nice ; clean ; and at a great location . </s> <s> Was in a safe area . </s> <s> Went to beautiful Wrigley Field and Soldier Field and saw both teams play . </s> <s> I love Chicago and would defenitely stay here again ! ' </s> 
<s> I would NOT recommend staying at the Swissotel in Chicago . </s> <s> I was travelling with a friend and we arrived at different times . </s> <s> She had booked the hotel but had added my name to the reservation since I would be arriving first . </s> <s> The " night manager " at the hotel was extremely rude and told me I could not check in since they could not find the note about my name being on the reservation . </s> <s> 'this was THEIR mistake ' They told me I could sit in the lobby for 4 hours until my friend arrived . </s> <s> They did nothing to try and help me until I stood there and complained for twenty minutes . </s> <s> I can 't believe that a " manager " would treat a customer this way . </s> <s> There are other great hotels in Chicago . </s> <s> This hotel is not worth the aggravation ! ' </s> 
<s> We arrived and thought for $350 a night ; it would be a decent place . </s> <s> Good reviews ; etc . . . </s> <s> We arrived to find that the website pictures were misleading . </s> <s> The hotel lounge was a " room " ; it was really odd and very dark . </s> <s> The first night there I noticed that the blanket on the bed was nasty looking . </s> <s> Resembled something you 'd find on a street . </s> <s> To top it all off we woke up after night '2 to find that bed bugs had attacked us . </s> <s> My husband and I were both bitten . </s> <s> I was bitten WAY more than my husband . </s> <s> My legs were covered with bites . </s> <s> I was on ointments and Benadryl for over a week . </s> <s> I immediately came home and scalded all our clothes . </s> <s> There was also mold around the tub both inside it and on the floor by it . </s> <s> The bathroom floor was also curling up by the tub . </s> <s> The view in room '607 is of a roof . </s> <s> Not good . </s> <s> The stay was VERY disappointing . </s> <s> The only good thing there is the free breakfast on every floor . ' </s> 
<s> Fairmont Hotels are generally my preferred choice ; but this was a true disappointment . </s> <s> Check-in was quite slow and problematic 'glitches with their reservation system locally ' . </s> <s> Room was very small and oddly arranged . </s> <s> Felt quite cramped in room and was hard to work at very small desk . </s> <s> Hotel overall felt quite cold and isolating . . . lobby is not at all inviting ; and it didn 't feel terribly safe walking around outside . </s> <s> Gift shop was overpriced ; even for a downtown hotel . </s> <s> Food was disappointing . </s> <s> Overall this seems greatly overpriced and does not meet usual standards of A Fairmont i 've come to count on . </s> <s> Bill was completely messed up and required 3 separate calls after i left to straighten out . ' </s> 
<s> Stayed here for one night in June ; but have stayed here before when on business in Chicago . </s> <s> Great location for business 'shopping 'sightseeing . </s> <s> In between Michigan Avenue 's Magnificent Mile and the Loop and next to the Chicago River . </s> <s> Rooms very spacious and clean . </s> <s> Gym has a wonderful view ; as it is situated on the top of the hotel . </s> <s> Bar next to lobby ; very busy with good atmosphere . </s> <s> Cannot fault the hotel . </s> <s> Prefer it to the Westin - my previous address when in Chicago . ' </s> 
<s> We stayed two nights . </s> <s> We were registered by a very unfriendly desk attendant . </s> <s> He was very cold . </s> <s> Our room was very ; very small and the closet did not even hold the few clothes we packed for two days . </s> <s> The room was stylishly decorated but lacked the nice small touches such as an extra pillow in the closet . </s> <s> We were attracted to this hotel because a bar was on the ground level - however when we went to have a drink ; the door to the bar was locked . </s> <s> We called to inquire why the sign said was open when it really wasn 't and were told they were short staffed ; 'sorry ' . </s> <s> WHAT ? ? </s> <s> are you running here ? </s> <s> You are a hotel in the country 's third largest city and your amenities are open at whim ? </s> <s> This was our first and last visit to a Kimpton hotel . ' </s> 
<s> This hotel does not belong in the same league as The Peninsula ; Four Seasons ; or Ritz Carlton . </s> <s> It was more like staying at an overpriced W Hotel . </s> <s> Staff was very nice and attentive ; but the lobby is cramped ; and only two small elevators for 17 floors ! ! </s> <s> Several times the elevator was full by the time it reached our floor ; and we were forced to take the stairs . </s> <s> The hotel must be flooding the travel websites itself with high reviews . ' </s> 
<s> Before booking this hotel ; I did read the reviews ; and I was concerned . </s> <s> I ended up booking it based on my sisters recommendation . </s> <s> BIG MISTAKE ! ! </s> <s> The temperature in Chicago was a balmy 99 degrees ; and the temp in the room that they gave us was about 85 degrees . </s> <s> When we called to complain at 11 : 00 am ; they told us to turn the temp down to 40degrees . </s> <s> We went back at 7 : 30pm . </s> <s> it was still humid ; the beds were moist ' the room very stuffy . </s> <s> Called again ; they sent somone to fix it ; ' he recommended getting a new room ; because the room will not cool down . </s> <s> They told us they were booked ; yet ; after the maintenance man called ; they suddenly had a room available ; go figure ? </s> <s> So they move us to another room ; guess what ; it is 85 degrees . </s> <s> Again ; they told us to turn it down to 40 ; needless to say ; it never cooled down ' we should have just slept on the street . </s> <s> We travel a lot ; and we stayed here one night ; and it was awful ! ! . </s> <s> At check out ; I had to re-tell our entire room issue ; they actually ended up not charging us for the night ; thank god they did not offer us anothers nights stay ; because we would never go back . </s> <s> Also ; the room decor is very old and stuffy . </s> <s> If your going to Chicago ; don 't stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker ! ! ' </s> 
<s> The room wasvery tiny and was very warm . </s> <s> They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do . </s> <s> The bathroom is small . </s> <s> The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review ; and does crackle under your feet . </s> <s> I ; personally ; did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality . </s> <s> The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in . </s> <s> This is basically an old hotel that has been updated . </s> <s> The comment about the closet is true ; it is actually indescriable . </s> <s> You can hear everything occuring in the other rooms . </s> <s> The location is convienent but so are many other hotels . </s> <s> If you do stay ; fly into Midway ; take the Orange Line ; you cannot go wrong .

<s> The Palmer House has a beautiful lobby with a great bar and restaurant . </s> <s> The rooms are way too small ! ! ! </s> <s> Two people in a room with a King size bed can barely move around . </s> <s> Not enough room for two suitcases . </s> <s> Our room was very outdated-reminded us of the movie The Shining . </s> <s> VERY NOISY ! ! ! ! </s> <s> Don 't expect a quiet stay . </s> <s> You can hear EVERYTHING that your neighbors are doing and saying not to mention everything that is happening in the hallways . </s> <s> We requested a room change as soon as we checked in . </s> <s> The room that we originally were in had a huge square cut out of the wall that had exposed pipes ; bricks ; dirt and dust . </s> <s> Oh and the construction for their renovations starts at 7 a . m . </s> <s> during the week . </s> <s> We will never stay at the Palmer House again . </s> <s> You are better off spending a few more dollars at a different hotel .

<s> Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Talbott . </s> <s> This was our first visit there ; and I can honestly say that I wouldn 't stay at any other hotel in Chicago . </s> <s> From when we first were greated by the bell captain until our final departure ; the staff was nothing less than amazing ; always greeting with a smile and can I help you attitute . </s> <s> The room we had '1508 ' was very spacious and comfortable . </s> <s> The bed was probably the most comfortable that my wife and I have ever slept in 'including the Four Seasons ' . </s> <s> Had great breakfasts and drinks at Basil 's . </s> <s> You would be missing a fantastic experience ; if you didn 't stay at the Talbott .

<s> This hotel is rather stupid to be frank . </s> <s> It 's a horrible attempt to be retro-sheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional . </s> <s> The rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there isn 't much in them . </s> <s> I actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink . </s> <s> I had to put my make-up on using the toliet for 5-days . </s> <s> It also took me 10-minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything . </s> <s> I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee b 'c the bathroom doors aren 't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan ! </s> <s> It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night . </s> <s> On a good note ; the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean . </s> <s> That 's about the only good thing I can say about this place . </s> <s> I would not go back .

<s> My Husband and I did not enjoy stay at Hotel Allegro ! </s> <s> The room was so small . </s> <s> The bathroom was ridiculously stupid ; everytime you use the sink you would splash water on yourself . </s> <s> Truly one person at time in the bathroom ; it was like being in an airplane 's bathroom . </s> <s> The walls are so thin ; we heard the people across hall having sex . </s> <s> The some staff were really rude . </s> <s> I did not appreciate it when we had a sign on the door saying do not disturb the day of our check out . </s> <s> Check out time is 11am or 12 and we got a know on the door at 8AM with the sign stating " do not disturb . </s> <s> " The hotel did not have any microwaves in their rooms ; no mini fridge ; and no coffee maker either . </s> <s> NO DRAWERS to put your clothes in and the closet was very very very tiny . </s> <s> We were there for four days and three nights ; so we had three suit cases full of clothes and no places to store them at . </s> <s> I also hated the fact that we had to pay almost fifty to park our car . </s> <s> My Husand and I will never stay at Hotel Allegro again ! ! !

<s> My family booked five nitghts at the Omni Chicago for our upcoming spring break . </s> <s> We took advantage of a pre-paid ; non-cancellable offer . </s> <s> We subsequently received a " Bed ' Breakfast " offer via email and immediately called the hotel to inquire whether we could switch our reservation 'same dates ; different offer ' . </s> <s> We called the 800 ' number and the customer services representative was so obnoxiously condescending and ignorant ; we simply hung up . </s> <s> We had been looking forward to our vacation ; but now I am not sure I made the right choice with this hotel . </s> <s> I should have paid closer attention to the reviews - the Ritz ; the Four Seasons ; and the Peninsula would have never treated us this way . </s> <s> I will post again after our stay on April 17th .

<s> This hotel does not live up to the reviews . </s> <s> The room was larger than I expected . </s> <s> However ; the decor was a bit dated . </s> <s> The bedding was ripped ; carpet was stained ; and the shower door was broken . </s> <s> There was a long wait to the elevators ; and if you 're on floors 2-6 you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym . </s> <s> The main issue I had was the attitude I received from the staff . </s> <s> There was literally only ONE nice person at the front desk . </s> <s> There are no ice machines in this building ; so you have to request it from the front desk . </s> <s> One day I requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person . </s> <s> 20 minutes later I made a follow up call because I did not receive my ice . </s> <s> I was nastily told that ice takes 10 minutes and I should just wait . </s> <s> I finally got the ice 10 minutes later . </s> <s> Two days later I requested ice again . </s> <s> Waited 30 minutes and just gave up . </s> <s> While I was leaving ; I mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said " I didn 't get a call for ice .

<s> Having booked the hotel directly with the hotel on its website ; I arrived tired from Ireland ; to find that they had mislaid my booking and had no room on that night ; but did have rooms for the rest of the week . </s> <s> They booked me in to another 'not as nice ' downtown hotel and paid for my taxi to that hotel and for that nights accommodation . </s> <s> On my return to the hotel next day ; I was upgraded to the Club level . </s> <s> What really impressed me was that the hotel did everything they could to make up for their earlier mistake . . . unprompted . </s> <s> Of course ; the hotel itself 'particularly on the 32nd floor ' is excellent . </s> <s> I will definitely be back .

<s> This place is a dump . </s> <s> I booked on Priceline ; because the last time I booked a Priceline hotel in Chicago ; I got the Westin and loved it . </s> <s> Despite having paid for Priceline ; I ate the money I had already spent and called for a reservation at the Westin and went there for the weekend ; instead . </s> <s> I didn 't regret it for a second . </s> <s> You will be disappointed if you stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker because you are paying for a Holiday Inn at the price of a Westin when you could have the real deal for just a little more . </s> <s> The location is not worth the place being old and so unimpressive . </s> <s> There are enough hotels near the loop 'and near a train 'bus stop if you need to move around the city inexpensively ' that you should not spend the money on the Millenium . </s> <s> Do not waste your time and stay here--this is a trap because of its location ; but it 's not worth it . </s> <s> Really . ' </s> 
<s> My initial thought of the hotel was ; this place is just ok ; I didnt look up any reviews as I was staying there with 2 other friends . </s> <s> I was truly impressed from ceiling to floor with the room . </s> <s> Views were good ; its just the surrounding buildings unless your towards the front where the river is located . </s> <s> I 'm crazy about huge bathrooms and this one is HUGE . </s> <s> I love all the space they have . </s> <s> Flat tv ; traditional seating and I admired the fabric-based headboards . </s> <s> Those are very nice ! </s> <s> Walking distance to restaurants were convenient . </s> <s> I 'm a highly frequent traveler to Chicago almost 20 years now and always stay with relatives . </s> <s> In any event ; I 'd recommend staying at the Monaco again ! ' </s> 
<s> I was very disappointed with the hotel this time . </s> <s> They seem to be coming down in quality quite a bit . </s> <s> The clientele also seem to be of a lower quality . </s> <s> The lobby was quite a rambunctious scene with no one on staff seeming to notice . </s> <s> The house keeper only did the bare minimum in the room each day and did not replace the used toiletries or the coffee ; she also left the dirty coffee cups in the room . </s> <s> I think I will have to stay with the InterContinental next time .

<s> I vacationed at the Fairmont Chicago for 3 nights in July 2009 . </s> <s> The room ; the bathroom ; the view ; and the staff were all wonderful . </s> <s> I just wish the hotel were a few blocks North 'on MI Ave ' . </s> <s> Sometimes ; when you 're tired ; that extra couple of blocks seem like miles !

<s> My wife and I stayed at this hotel at the end of May ; 2009 . </s> <s> She came for the weekend for a function and we extended the trip to take in the city . </s> <s> We got a deal on this hotel through TravelZoos . </s> <s> $249 'night stay for $99 'night plus we got the full buffet breakfast . </s> <s> The room was wonderful . </s> <s> Extremely large King size bed with expansive sitting area . </s> <s> We are used to smaller hotels with little room to move . </s> <s> The bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows . </s> <s> No wear or damage in room at all except sink tap dripped a bit 'poor taps ' . </s> <s> We could have upgraded to river view for $20 'night but chose not to . </s> <s> We enjoyed the room for what it was . </s> <s> 22nd floor looking south . </s> <s> The buffet breakfast was great . </s> <s> Lots to choose from and very fresh with made to order eggs ; non stop coffee and juice and the servers were so eager to please . </s> <s> Great to have breakfast included in night stay . </s> <s> Might be a bit dear to pay at $22 'person . </s> <s> It was nice to sit and relax with good breakfast ; coffee and newspaper and not have to figure where to catch a morning meal . </s> <s> Concierge desk was most helpful in suggesting places to eat ; always informative and ready to provide maps ; directions ; multiple suggestions and even make the reservations . </s> <s> Cards included to admit without paying cover charges at some jazz clubs . </s> <s> Location was great . </s> <s> Blocks from El and other transportation and easy walking distance to the parks and right on the river . </s> <s> If in Chicago again ; would not hesitate to stay here again . </s> <s> A swimming pool would have been nice but we did not miss it . ' </s> 
<s> We didn 't stay in the hotel a lot because we went for the sites not the room . </s> <s> Saying that ; we picked this hotel because it was the cheapest but the hotel not having any parking we spent money on parking our car than what we could have spent on a better more expensive hotel with parking . </s> <s> Hotel is great for guys getaway weekend that won 't have a car . </s> <s> Not a family frienly hotel . </s> <s> Dining tip : Long walk from hotel Gino 's pizza is a must have ! ! </s> <s> Worth the walk . </s> <s> Many things in between hotel and Gino 's to do so you can break up the walk .

<s> What a fabulous hotel ! </s> <s> From its location directly on the Magnificant Mile and surrounded by the finest shopping ; to the curtious staff and excellent restaurants and bars ; this hotel is one of the best in Chicago . </s> <s> Our room was very clean and fresh ; the public areas comfortable and the staff at the concierge and front desk very extremely helpful . </s> <s> This is the only place to stay to be in the cnetre of the action in Chicago . </s> <s> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !

<s> I want to issue a travel-warning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time : The deal says " free breakfast " included in the price . </s> <s> However ; what they don 't tell you ; is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit 'or two ' ! </s> <s> Moreover ; you need to ask for these " tickets " at the lobby when you check in - they won 't give them to you automatically ! </s> <s> We stayed there over Christmas '03 ; and we ; and I noticed several guests who bought the same package ; had a rather unpleasant experience ! </s> <s> The hotel is nice though ; if you don 't consider their lousy service !

<s> We live down the block from the hotel . </s> <s> We arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away . </s> <s> The floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night . </s> <s> I think the Ambassador East was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there . </s> <s> Over the years I had had some visiting groups stay there . </s> <s> I had also eaten there and been to the bar but I had never stayed there myself . </s> <s> The lobby is elegant . </s> <s> The service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated . </s> <s> The location is the best residential area in the city 'as far as I am concerned -- I live two blocks away ' and it is very convenient to North Michigan Avenue ' a good shopping street ' and reasonably convenient to the Loop ' the main business area ' There are also probably 50 restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city . </s> <s> I paid less than $100 including tax for one night . </s> <s> I am not sure what their regular rates are but I think my deal was the best travel bargain around .

<s> My wife and I stayed two nights at the Talbott at the end of February . </s> <s> This little hotel was the perfect place for us . </s> <s> The lobby is very small but also cozy ; and with both fireplaces going it was a welcoming atmosphere coming in from the cold . </s> <s> The staff was very friendly and efficient . </s> <s> The room was pretty spacious ; and the king bed was extremely comfortable . </s> <s> We had a seventh floor room facing delaware st ; so there was really no view . </s> <s> The bathroom was a good size ; including two sinks and a spacious tub 'shower . </s> <s> There was also free wireless internet . . . a big plus for us . </s> <s> Perhaps the best thing about the Talbott is the location . </s> <s> We were only a few steps from State ; Rush ; and North Michigan . </s> <s> Tons of shopping ; bars ; and good food are easily within walking distance . </s> <s> This makes the Talbott a great place for tourists who want to walk around and take everything in . </s> <s> We highly recommend the Talbott ; and will gladly stay again on return trips .

<s> Our third stay at the Homewood Suites Chicago proved to be just as great as the previous two . </s> <s> The staff are consistently friendly ; polite and professional - and this applies whether they are working at the front door ; servicing the rooms ; managing the breakfast room or on the reception desk . </s> <s> They genuinely seem happy to be working here and can 't do enough for their guests . </s> <s> The rooms are large and clean and seem to have good insulation from each other 'we didn 't hear a thing from our neighbours and the hotel was quite busy ' . </s> <s> The hotel is well placed for walking to the shops on Michigan Ave ; or catching a bus or subway . </s> <s> There is a Jewel Osco and a Trader Joes each within a couple of blocks ; which are perfect for stocking up on groceries etc . </s> <s> My husband heartily recommends 'Binnies Beverage Depot ' for a huge variety of beer . </s> <s> Now all we need is an excuse to return to Chicago next year - then we can make it four years on the run at the Homewood Suites ; because we wouldn 't stay anywhere else ! ' </s> 
<s> Excellent service ! </s> <s> Clean and spacious rooms with a great view of downtown Chicago . </s> <s> Location is excellent for exploring the main sights and the Golden Mile . </s> <s> Great concierge service . </s> <s> Pricey though . . . </s> <s> Don 't valet if you don 't need to . ' </s>

<s> I loved this hotel - fabulous old building but with first class modern amenities . </s> <s> Great location ; as it 's so close to both lakeshore and city . </s> <s> Chicago is such a walkable city ; so this was a superb base . </s> <s> The staff were just lovely - so very friendly and efficient . </s> <s> The room was wonderful - very ; very comfortable and exceptionally clean . </s> <s> Great chair . </s> <s> Great coffee . </s> <s> Lovely bathroom with a huge ; absolutely fantastic shower . </s> <s> It was also extremely quiet . </s> <s> That ; and the best bed ever ; meant I slept so well and since I was there for a week ; that was very important to me . </s> <s> Yummy martinis at the Martini Bar . </s> <s> I will most definitley be back !

<s> My fiance and I traveled to Chicago for the first time this December and we were not happy with this hotel . </s> <s> The friendliest people on the staff were the bell boys . </s> <s> They greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay . </s> <s> The rest of the staff however was terrible . </s> <s> When we first checked in ; I was instantly discouraged . </s> <s> The front desk person was not in a good mood and I couldn 't wait to leave the lobby . </s> <s> Having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing . </s> <s> We asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations . </s> <s> We felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff . </s> <s> At one point ; the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her ; as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well . </s> <s> Even though she saw us standing there ; after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first . </s> <s> Yes ; we are in our mid 20 's ; but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible . </s> <s> For how much money we paid for each night ; I would have rather stayed somewhere else . </s> <s> We decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews ; but we did not experience any of this during our stay . </s> <s> The rooms were alright ; but nothing special . </s> <s> I would not stay in this hotel again . ' </s> 
<s> First room 's heating system sounded like we had a generator in our room . </s> <s> Second room had stool in the toilet and a smear on the linens 'which we didn 't notice until morning-eeewwhh ! ' </s> <s> . </s> <s> The computer ; scale and ink pen didn 't work . </s> <s> The maintainance man took 30 mins to come unplug the toilet and dripped to toilet water through bathroom and on carpet . </s> <s> This room was quiet and the bed 'pillows comfortable . </s> <s> The bath was large and water warm . ' </s> 
<s> We had a king deluxe room for 2 nights . </s> <s> We reserved the room through the hotel website with AAA discount . </s> <s> We paid $180 'nt . </s> <s> We enjoy boutique hotels ; as they have so much more personality and personal service . </s> <s> This hotel was no exception . </s> <s> Every employee we encountered was pleasant and helpful . </s> <s> The room was clean ; well decorated ; spacious and quiet . </s> <s> We were offered at check-in a room with a view ; but warned it was across from the elevator ; so we decided to take the quiet ; large room with no view . </s> <s> The location of the hotel was perfect for us ; we saw Wicked while in Chicago and had no problem walking to the theater . </s> <s> We also walked the Magnificient Mile and found the location perfect 'we like to walk ' . </s> <s> We had drinks at the hotel restaurant both nights which was a pleasurable experience . </s> <s> We ate room service for breakfast each morning ; and the food was good and the portions were quite large . </s> <s> We would definitely stay here again . ' </s> 
<s> I stayed at the Sheraton as it was where a conference I was attending was being held . </s> <s> On the plus side ; the hotel is reasonably well located ; within a few minutes walk of Michigan Avenue . </s> <s> My room had a superb view out over the river . </s> <s> However ; for the price I must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment . </s> <s> The decor was dated ; and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty . </s> <s> The wifi is ridiculously expensive ; and frustratingly as a conference delegate I was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access . </s> <s> There was no wifi in the conference rooms ; although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails . </s> <s> I know Chicago is expensive ; but for that price I feel the experience should have been better . ' </s> 
<s> Will not stay here again . </s> <s> We were here pre-construction so didn 't have the noise problems that others are now experiencing . </s> <s> But room and service quality were so poor that we will not return . </s> <s> Our suite was large enough ; but it was dirty ; dated and worn . </s> <s> The bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly . </s> <s> Public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days ; disgusting . </s> <s> We 'politely ' requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed . </s> <s> We had paid for the King Tut Package ; which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit . </s> <s> They had no record of this and didn 't honor it . </s> <s> Of course ; the exhibit was sold out ; so our main reason for visiting Chicago was ruined as we weren 't able to see this part of the Field museum . </s> <s> My 'also polite ' letter to Hilton and the manager was never acknowledged . </s> <s> Very very disappointed in this property and am now avoiding Hilton in general when possible . ' </s> 
<s> I already wrote a review about all the free stuff you get but now I 'm going to write about the location ! </s> <s> I like to walk . </s> <s> This place was close to EVERYTHING ! ! ! ! </s> <s> The 'Taste of Chicago ' was on during the 4th of July . </s> <s> Let me tell you ; this was the best 'taste ' of a city that I have ever been to . </s> <s> It was massive and took 10 mins to walk there . </s> <s> I took the train in from the airport 'it was around $2 . 00 but it was a solid 45 mins but for $2 . 00 ; how can you complain ? ' </s> <s> and it was approx a 10 walk to the hotel . </s> <s> We pretty much walked everywhere . </s> <s> We walked the entire magnificent mile strip . </s> <s> We went to the Blue Navy or whatever the docks are called . </s> <s> My favourite bar was 'Pops for Champagne . ' </s> <s> Wow . </s> <s> I love champagne . </s> <s> And then of course there was the John Hancock Centre . </s> <s> And lots of shopping ! ' </s> 
<s> I usually stay at the Hotel Monaco but stayed at the Allegro because most the Monaco was booked . </s> <s> While the Allegro is similar to the Monaco in it 's decor 'less traditional and more funky interior ' it is not nearly as nice . </s> <s> The linens are not as high quality as the Monaco and the rooms are not decorated as nice . </s> <s> The rooms are also smaller . </s> <s> The main reason I would not recommend the hotel though ; is the bathroom . </s> <s> It has an old tiled floor ; with an old sink ; and old toilet . </s> <s> It reminds me of something you would find in a men 's locker room . </s> <s> Although the Allegro has installed a nice mirror ; it does not make up for the limited counter space and dingy apperance . </s> <s> Also ; the layout of the bathroom is terrible . </s> <s> The toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sits in your lap as you sit on the toilet . </s> <s> Also ; the room is not very clean as well . </s> <s> The floor in my room was dirty and I found crumbs in the drawers . </s> <s> I would recommend staying at the Monaco ; Hard Rock ; or Soffitel for a hotel that is a little less traditional but still nice . ' </s> 
<s> I travel to chicago quite often ; and have stayed at a bunch of hotels . </s> <s> I stayed at Conrad a couple of times . </s> <s> My impression was not too good . </s> <s> Both times the receptionist was quite cold and I didn 't feel welcome at all . </s> <s> The room was noisy . </s> <s> Thin walls ; and you could hear exactly what the next room is talking about . </s> <s> One time the tv was broken too ; and a guy came in and took like an hour to fix it . . . </s> <s> Anyway ; given that this is a 4 . 5 star hotel ; it really didnt live up to my expectations . </s> <s> After the 1st time at this hotel ; I thought I might give it a second try . </s> <s> After the 2nd time ; I decided I am really not coming back ; especially given that there are so many other hotels close by . </s> <s> The other attendees of our conferences were also complaining about the hotel . </s> <s> So I guess I am not alone in this . . . ' </s> 
<s> If I didn 't have to stay here ; I wouldn 't . </s> <s> Without exception ; I swear I am not lying ; every day of my stay brings a new problem . </s> <s> Over the past 3 months ; I have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time ; problems every time . </s> <s> From the wrong food with room service ; to room keys that dont work ; unrefreshed bath towels ; forgotten and dirty in-room coffee service ; unclean ice bucket overnight ; forgotten room cleaning ; inability to connect to the Internet . . . . I 'm too tired to keep writing all the problems . </s> <s> For the price of this chi-chi downtown hotel ; I expect more . </s> <s> Finally ; their team is certainly not trained in customer service . </s> <s> The front desk teams have attitudes ; and Aria 's hostesses think they are something else . </s> <s> I 'm stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to Aon ; but I would never go back if I had a choice . </s> <s> The only good thing is the food at Aria - outstanding . ' </s> 
<s> My sister and I stayed on the 22nd floor ; there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights ; beat up and old dorm style . </s> <s> It was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on Tripadvisor did the thing get removed . </s> <s> Breakfast dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two routinely . </s> <s> All night there are chimes that make noise ; that are supposed to be comformting or relaxing and rather they are just annoying . </s> <s> There is no wifi - no matter what they tell you ; I paid for the wifi ; and still we were unable to get on . </s> <s> Lastly ; my sister and I split the bill ; I had already paid for the first night in form of a deposit and they gave her the credit . </s> <s> Room cost with city taxes etc . </s> <s> was 313 . 69 a night . </s> <s> I know the Comfort Inn just a few blocks away is significantly cheaper ! </s> <s> So while the View was wonderful ; it is NOT worth the money . ' </s> 
<s> The service from check-in to checkout was excellent - timely and efficient . </s> <s> The room was more then I has expected . </s> <s> It was spacious and laid out very well . </s> <s> I particularly enjoyed the living room area as well as the double closets and separate bath and shower . </s> <s> The bed abd pillows were extremely comfortable . </s> <s> I believe it 's the first time I stayed in a hotel that provided a toothbrush and toothpaste in the room . </s> <s> The location was perfect for us as we were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go . </s> <s> I particularly enjoyed the excellent food at theChina Grill which is attached to the Hard Rock hotel . </s> <s> The service was very good and the staff very friendly .

<s> I stayed at ICH Chicago for business in November of 2006 and loved it . </s> <s> As a Royal Ambassador member ; they upgraded me to a beautiful junior suite with a separate living and working area and 2 bathrooms ! </s> <s> My upgrade was in place upon arrival and a beautiful fruit basket was waiting for me on the coffee table . </s> <s> They even had a nice young lady escort me to my room . </s> <s> The suite was beautifully furnished and had an Art Deco feel to it . </s> <s> The only thing I regretted was that I only stayed one night . </s> <s> I will definitely stay here on my next visit .

<s> This hotel was chosen by my husband 's company as the family came along for the business trip . </s> <s> The location was excellent and we had a great view of the lake and aquarium from the 34th floor . </s> <s> My first impressions were that the room was very nice and everything appeared to be clean . </s> <s> The lobby was undergoing renovation at the entrance ; but was otherwise ok . </s> <s> Lots of conferences were taking place so the wait for the elevators was long . </s> <s> Seemed like only 2 elevators were working out of the 6 that were there . </s> <s> I had read from another reviewer to join the Fairmont President 's club and wi-fi in the room would be free . </s> <s> We signed up for the club ; but were puzzled as to why they don 't just offer everyone free wi-fi . </s> <s> Parking fees were exorbitant at $58 'night ; but thankfully the company was paying for this . </s> <s> We were able to walk to Millennium Park and Navy Pier from our hotel . </s> <s> The hotel is NOT kid-friendly in terms of restaurants or amenities . </s> <s> There is no swimming pool ; but the concierge arranged for us to swim at the Swissotel next door 'there is an underground tunnel that connects the Fairmont there ' . </s> <s> We loved the Swissotel 's pool on the 42nd floor . </s> <s> Fantastic views from the pool ! </s> <s> Although the beds were comfortable ; my daughter and I were both victims of bed bugs during our stay . </s> <s> Unfortunately we didn 't know until the next day after we returned home . </s> <s> Apparently bed bug bites can take up to 7 days to appear . </s> <s> My daughter and I both shared a bed and were bitten on our sides from our necks to our hips . </s> <s> The bites made you want to claw your skin off ! </s> <s> My husband and son who shared the other bed were not bitten at all . </s> <s> Beware of room 3405 -- bed nearest the bathroom ! ! ! </s> <s> I will not be fooled by a clean room again and will be checking under mattresses from now on . . . .

<s> My husband ; teenage son and myself stayed at this hotel last August . </s> <s> We were transferred there by tour operator who had sent us to a terrible hotel on the other side of Chicago . </s> <s> When I complained I asked for us to be transferred to the Sheraton which they arranged for us . </s> <s> I have stayed at many hotels in my life and this has been the best . </s> <s> The room 'although I know it was not the largest ' was beautiful and very clean with every amenity you needed . </s> <s> It also had superb views of the river and the lake . </s> <s> The entrance hall to the Sheraton is so imressive as is the leisure centre . </s> <s> In fact all areas are fantastic . </s> <s> The best thing about the hotel though was the staff ! </s> <s> From the bellboy ; to the receptionists ; the dining staff to the concierge - each one was courteous and so very helpful . </s> <s> One of the conciergies spent fifteen minutes on the phone trying to locate a specific pair of trainers for my son ! </s> <s> Above and beyond the call I would say ! </s> <s> I cannot reccomend this hotel highly enough . </s> <s> The breakfast buffet cost about 10 dollars each but you could eat as much as you like and take as long as you like which we did ! ! </s> <s> It lasted us all day . </s> <s> If you have the choice of where to stay I think you will enjoy the Sheraton ! </s> <s> We did ! !

<s> For a supposed 4-star hotel ; I was not very impressed at akk . </s> <s> The lobby was nice and modern-looking ; but there were no bellhops outside to help with bags or open the doors 'we didn 't arrive that late at night ' . </s> <s> Additionally ; when we walked into the hotel late one night ; there was trash and flowers strewn on the lobby floor and ; it seemed that there were always water bottles and glasses near the seating area as you walked in . </s> <s> Where was the staff to clean up ? </s> <s> That 's not a very welcoming sight . </s> <s> The rooms were nice and clean and provided a great view ; but the actual location was farther than I would have preferred from Michigan Avenue ; andi it was also a little too far south . </s> <s> Area recommendations Rush Street was a lot of fun at night !

<s> First ; several day s prior to my stay ; I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service Saturday and Sunday . </s> <s> Saturday they didn 't bring breakfast - and when I called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge . </s> <s> When they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing . . </s> <s> and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday . </s> <s> I was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night . </s> <s> The food was limp and uninspired . </s> <s> Further ; I ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon . </s> <s> When I called in-room dining to request a spoon ; I was told one would be forthcoming . </s> <s> 15 minutes later ; a waiter arrived with a menu . </s> <s> When I explained I already had food and I didn 't need a menu - I needed a spoon ; he had the audacity to argue with me . </s> <s> I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so . </s> <s> Another 15 minutes 'and one bowl of cold soup ' later I decided to call in-room dining back to request 'again ' they send someone with a spoon . </s> <s> They too argued with me and expressed that they 'd already sent someone with a spoon . </s> <s> I explained that they had not - that I had received a menu I didn 't request ; but that no spoon was forthcoming . </s> <s> Another 15 minutes later ; a spoon finally arrived . </s> <s> Thanks - for charging me $100 ' so that I could argue over cold ; flavorless food . </s> <s> In addition to the gross customer service ; surly attitude ; and sorry food ; I found the room woefully lacking . </s> <s> It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell . </s> <s> Further ; I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators . . . </s> <s> I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went .

<s> I only stayed at this hotel for one night ; the location was great but the elevators drove me crazy . </s> <s> After the first long wait I started to time how long it took from the moment I pushed the button until the elevator arrived ; never under 10 min . </s> <s> even late at night . </s> <s> I went up to the rooftop for and after dinner drink with my husband . . . </s> <s> 1 margarita was $14 ! </s> <s> I wans 't drinking because I 'm pregnant so I had a soda water for $4 . . . </s> <s> if I would have known I would have had tap water . </s> <s> Overall . . . </s> <s> great rooms ; OK staff ; horrible elevators ; overpriced drinks .

<s> After checking out of the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the other day ; I left the hotel ; crossed the street and started to walk EB on Chestnut while looking for a cab . </s> <s> I was still within sight of a Sofitel doorman when I sighted a cab approximately one block away and attempted to hail same . </s> <s> After doing so ; I immediately heard a Sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle . </s> <s> As the cab slowed to pick me up ; the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction . </s> <s> When the cab stopped ; I quickly entered cab and locked the door for fear of being physically attacked by the Sofitel doorman . </s> <s> After locking the door ; the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to accost me from outside of the cab . </s> <s> After claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs ; he suggested that I had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a " jerk " before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination . </s> <s> Consequently ; unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen ; please don 't attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman . </s> <s> Lastly ; as for the rest of my stay ; you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in French instead of English . </s> <s> While I have nothing against the French or French language ; I much prefer communicating in English when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world . </s> <s> Viva la USA !
