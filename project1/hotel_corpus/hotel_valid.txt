<s> IsTruthFul,IsPositive,review I was recently a guest at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and was immensely dissatisfied. </s>
<s> arrived to find that they had " lost " my reservation. </s>
<s> told me they were booked solid even though I had produced my copy of the reservation confirmation. </s>
<s> nearly an hour of arguing with the front desk clerk she finally asked for the hotel manager to step in. </s>
<s> was almost helpful. </s>
<s> searched the database and found that there was a " cancellation " ; however ; it was not for the type of room I had reserved. </s>
<s> had asked for a suite as I was going to be staying in the hotel for several days. </s>
<s> was given a box with a bed in it. </s>
<s> made no apologies for losing my reservation and offered no alternate compensation. </s>
<s> ; I was in town for a conference and everyone in the area was completely booked. </s>
<s> had no choice but to accept what they had offered. </s>
<s> begrudgingly accepted this with the intention of contacting the corporate office and posting my review here. </s>
<s> not stay in this hotel they will NOT help you with anything ; even if it was their error. </s>
<s> Hotel Chicago - We stayed at Amalfi Hotel Chicago last July for a weekend. </s>
<s> is a contemporary boutique hotel with a perfect location in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> is close to most interesting attractions in Chicago area such as museums and shopping centers including Magnificent Mile ; Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue. </s>
<s> enjoyed every minute of our stay. </s>
<s> room and its bathroom were clean. </s>
<s> were comfortable and staff was polite and very helpful. </s>
<s> especially enjoyed the great continental breakfast ; which was offered in a nice and shiny hall. </s>
<s> this hotel has a good selection of dishes for lunch and dinner. </s>
<s> only complain is that we had to wait in a queue for about 10 minutes to check in on arrival day but this was minor issue given the great experience we had at Amalfi. </s>
<s> will definitely stay again at this nice hotel when we are back in Chicago next summer. </s>
<s> chose to stay at the Hilton Chicago because it was in such a centralized location- everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close ! What I did n't expect was for the beds to be so comfortable. </s>
<s> ca n't remember when I got a better night 's sleep. </s>
<s> staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept. </s>
<s> 'll be returning to the Hilton Chicago the next time we 're in town ! My family and I recently attended a wedding in Chicago and stayed at the Swissotel. </s>
<s> was much nicer than we expected. </s>
<s> are used to staying at mid-class hotels and this ; by far ; was one of the nicest places we 've stayed. </s>
<s> beds were so comfortable and the crib the provided for my infant son was great quality - I was concerned that we would get a rickety 1970s crib ! The bed sheets were so soft that I wanted to take them home ! We will definitely go back to this hotel the next time we are in Chicago. </s>
<s> : -- Overrated hotel in a premium location. </s>
<s> Great : -- Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants ; bars ; and sights. </s>
<s> Good : -- Inviting lobby ; pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby ; in particular the night deskman. </s>
<s> bathroom ; comfortable bed and desk chair. </s>
<s> Mediocre : -- Room ' excluding bathroom was underwhelming in design. </s>
<s> kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray 's across the street. </s>
<s> cocktails 5-7pm in " lounge " is right idea with wrong execution ; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. </s>
<s> water ' or lack thereof - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. </s>
<s> is pretty low. </s>
<s> - mine was n't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. </s>
<s> Bad : -- Free wi-fi ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day ; even when my computer was n't moved - really aggravating. </s>
<s> deal for my iPhone. </s>
<s> also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. </s>
<s> blackout curtains ! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning ' not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night. </s>
<s> had this issue in any hotel or motel I 've ever stayed at. </s>
<s> ! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling ; bar music ; trucks ; car horns ; and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. </s>
<s> had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. </s>
<s> had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel. </s>
<s> the remote was useless. </s>
<s> room bar had standard inflated prices but the $ 7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting. </s>
<s> n't even think of opening it ; there 's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. </s>
<s> : -- Not recommended. </s>
<s> much nicer in the website photos than it is. </s>
<s> on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star. </s>
<s> should I start ? Well ; after staying at the Ambassador East Hotel ; i realized it was my favorite hotel ever. </s>
<s> rooms are amazing. </s>
<s> food is great. </s>
<s> Pump room bar is awesome. </s>
<s> love this hotel. </s>
<s> your ever in Chicago ; the Ambassador East Hotel is the place to go. </s>
<s> brought our giant rottweiler and she had a great time. </s>
<s> rooms ; but this is normal for the chicago hotel scene. </s>
<s> of interesting amenities in the room. </s>
<s> to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping. </s>
<s> loved the lobby -- a great place to hang around or wait for someone. </s>
<s> of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere. </s>
<s> out : The concierge ' like all concierges at big hotels will direct you to mediocre ; large restaurants where they get kickbacks. </s>
<s> have stayed here several times and I always check for rooms here when I travel to Chicago. </s>
<s> ; the hotel is often full so book early. </s>
<s> stayed at the Fairmont during a professional conference. </s>
<s> I have to say that for a conference ; some of the meeting rooms were too small ; in terms of traveler 's comfort the hotel is exceptional ! I ca n't think of a single thing about my room that was n't perfect. </s>
<s> accommodations were luxurious and the hotel is conveniently situated within walking distance of many Chicago attractions. </s>
<s> hotel gives you a lot for a reasonable price ! It has a great downtown location and a lot of added bonuses. </s>
<s> loved the evening cocktail hour with free alcoholic beverages and appetizers. </s>
<s> also have complimentary breakfast and complimentary dinner. </s>
<s> fitness center was very clean ; I did n't want to leave it ! Our room was a spacious suite with a kitchen included ! And I took advantage of the free grocery delivery. </s>
<s> are comfortable and the room looks like it was recently renovated. </s>
<s> the thing that really stood out was the teamwork of such a wonderful staff. </s>
<s> will be back to the Homewood Suites the next time we come to Chicago ! After reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed. </s>
<s> booked through their web site about 2 1 '2 months prior to arrival for $ 170 'night plus tax for a room with 2 queens. </s>
<s> location was perfect - right by the river near Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> - minutes walk to the El ; Millenium Park ; the Theater District and Shopping. </s>
<s> room was clean ; a little larger than standard and nicely decorated. </s>
<s> had window seats in the room with a view of the river. </s>
<s> was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening. </s>
<s> top it off ; the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area. </s>
<s> our first trip to Chicago ; my fiance and I stayed 2 nights on our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised by the Hotel and the service we received from the personnel. </s>
<s> the past from other " luxury hotels " we have paid much more and received much less. </s>
<s> the room were very spacious ; comfortable and sleek. </s>
<s> spent come time in the hotel bar ; LE BAR ; and enjoyed a few of their specialty martinis that were second to none ! We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel 's Cafe des Architectes and received service some of the best service in quite some time. </s>
<s> traveling with a lover we recommend the " Air of Romance " package. </s>
<s> was the best ! 6 stars ! I have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood ; cost and amenities. </s>
<s> hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open ; you would n't know it. </s>
<s> need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock. </s>
<s> beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a " nicer historic hotel. </s>
<s> " 
I will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime. </s>
<s> was a very frustrating experience. </s>
<s> needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago. </s>
<s> higher priced ; the reviews online plus four stars convinced me. </s>
<s> the hotel itself is beautiful ; but looks can be deceiving. </s>
<s> pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey. </s>
<s> restaurant ' Cafe Des Architect had amazing food ; so that was a plus ; but the service was awful. </s>
<s> had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water ! My remote would n't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud. </s>
<s> hotel must 've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night. </s>
<s> housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently. </s>
<s> called twice for more fresh towels. </s>
<s> I wanted this type of experience ; I 'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel. </s>
<s> experience ; less money ! I only stayed out with my boyfriend for one night ; however enjoyed my stay. </s>
<s> staff was friendly ; the room was nice and clean ; the hallways and ballrooms etc were elegant. </s>
<s> service was quick and had good options to choose from that actually tasted great. </s>
<s> staff was able to extend our check out time for an extra 1-2 hours without an extra charge to the room. </s>
<s> location too ! Walking distance from the Art Museum ; Millennium Park ; Grant Park ' right across the street and a quick cab ride to McCormick Place. </s>
<s> I were in the city again I would love to stay there again. </s>
<s> Hard Rock is glossy and sexy ; but an absolutely fantastic hotel . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
I was in town for business and stayed here because of it 's location ; but I absolutely understand why tourists would like it . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> right on the river ; cool art deco building and Millenium Park is just down the street. </s>
<s> the room was clean ; the staff was friendly ; but NOT annoying and the bar was fun. </s>
<s> was comfortable having a couple of drinks alone at the end of the day - they were GOOD ! I 'll definitely try it again ! If you are looking for a luxurious downtown Chicago experience ; the Conrad Chicago is the place to stay. </s>
<s> rooms are equipped with the most comfortable beds dressed with the most luxurious bedding ; a 42 inch flat screen television ; a spa like bathroom with marble vanity and soaking tub ; and views of downtown Chicago that will take your breath away. </s>
<s> hotel has many amenities for you to enjoy while you are there including great restaurants and bars ; high speed internet ; a fitness facility and laundry services. </s>
<s> hotel was a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality place to stay in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> I planned my summer vacation ; I was wanting to travel somewhere new. </s>
<s> was on my mind because of the fast city life. </s>
<s> got in a flight to Chicago and arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel. </s>
<s> was grand and I spent a total of 4 days and nights there. </s>
<s> luxury was exotic and the location was right around the corner from most shopping and dining venues. </s>
<s> room service had me drooling because the food was so delicious ; I could hardly picture not feeling satisfied. </s>
<s> met up with a few of my friends and they offered me a tour around town. </s>
<s> enjoyed the stay there and will come back sooner than later. </s>
<s> Ambssador East Hotel - They were out of rooms with king-sized beds when I checked in ; so I was stuck with a small bed in a room with two beds. </s>
<s> did n't even receive any compensation for the trouble. </s>
<s> usually rely on the light to wake me up in the morning ; but I made the mistake of sleeping on the bed further away from the windows ; so I woke up late the next day. </s>
<s> bathroom 's big enough ; but housekeeping does n't replenish the supplies everyday ; which is annoying. </s>
<s> restaurant 's too expensive ; so I was forced to leave the hotel to get dinner. </s>
<s> would n't stay here again on my own money. </s>
<s> wife and I stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it. </s>
<s> atmosphere was very chic upscale ; in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank. </s>
<s> wife even got to bring along her dog ' aka ' 1 man !. </s>
<s> would definitely stay here again would recommend it to anyone staying in the Chicago area. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for business ; but extended my stay through the weekend because i loved it ! The accommodations exceeded my expectations. </s>
<s> bed was very comfortable ; the room was big enough ; and the shower was so relaxing. </s>
<s> had a great meal in the chop shop and the coffee was delicious at J 's express. </s>
<s> fitness center was clean ; and inspiring. </s>
<s> will recommend this hotel to others while in the area. </s>
<s> have stayed in hotels all over the world ; and this is probably the worst service that I 've ever experienced. </s>
<s> staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would. </s>
<s> decided to try the Monaco because it seemed interesting ; was close to the theater ; and had what seemed to be a good rate. </s>
<s> a huge mistake. </s>
<s> front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful. </s>
<s> room was not clean ; the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving ; they never bothered to come turn down the beds ; and the late check-out " priviledges " which were guarenteed when I booked the room suddenly became " upon request " - boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful. </s>
<s> waste your time or your money here. </s>
<s> best ; it 's nothing special. </s>
<s> ; I like the Fairmont in Chicago ; but anyplace woudl be better than the Monaco. </s>
<s> ca n't recall another time I 've had to deal with such rude front desk help. </s>
<s> pleasant initially ; as soon as I demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that I was still waiting to claim my luggage for check-in ' I arrived prior to check-in time ; so they were holding a few bags ; the true quality of this establishment surfaced. </s>
<s> mind that the luggage was n't sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 7 : 30pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop. </s>
<s> that was a bit annoying ; the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of Donna ; the very attractive but aloof front desk employee. </s>
<s> lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness ; as I noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay ; including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning. </s>
<s> also booked a rate that included parking ; which Donna acknowledged at check-in but at check out billed me separately ; I assume after I got on her bad side. </s>
<s> with my last polite good bye to the front desk ; I felt a phony ; uppity attitude from Donna ; and I really ca n't convey the extent of how insulting it felt. </s>
<s> can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy. </s>
<s> location as well. </s>
<s> be fair ; most of the staff seemed very friendly ; and I am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier. </s>
<s> I think most travelers ; like me ; would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service ; so as to not have a " situation " that could single-handedly ruin a travel experience. </s>
<s> ; that was the case here. </s>
<s> is the best word to describe the Conrad Chicago hotel. </s>
<s> it may be in downtown Chicago ; the room had no view. </s>
<s> I asked for non-smoking ; the room reeked of smoke. </s>
<s> elevators were very slow ; and one was not working during my stay. </s>
<s> was a stain on the pillow ; and the leg of one of the chairs in the room was broken. </s>
<s> was a dead bug in the bath tub. </s>
<s> was only given 2 towels for my 4 night stay. </s>
<s> credit card was billed twice ; and it took 2 weeks to reverse to extra charge. </s>
<s> do not recommend this hotel at all ! I stayed in the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago last week ; and I was extremely disappointed with my experience. </s>
<s> breakfast buffet was minimal and did not seem to be frequently restocked. </s>
<s> came downstairs about 30 minutes before the end of the breakfast period to find about half of the food options completely depleted. </s>
<s> ; the milk provided for the coffee and cereals was warm ; having been kept out on the counter. </s>
<s> would have been better off bringing my own food ! Also ; the layout of the rooms is extremely awkward. </s>
<s> had to move the furniture around to be able to watch TV ; and then move it back before I could make dinner or comfortably use the room in other ways. </s>
<s> could barely close the door to the bedroom past the corner of the bed. </s>
<s> just was n't what I would expect from a Hilton-brand hotel suite. </s>
<s> went to the Homewood Suites in Chicago which is part of Hilton 's famous hotels. </s>
<s> gotta say that this is the worst hotel that I have ever been to. </s>
<s> fact ; Homewood Suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet. </s>
<s> checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape. </s>
<s> fact ; the rooms looked so bad that I wanted to leave the hotel early. </s>
<s> also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel. </s>
<s> saw one of the employees and when I rung the bell for my room ; they ignored me. </s>
<s> could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you ? One more thing that I hate about this hotel is that the logo did n't look like the actual logo. </s>
<s> looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw. </s>
<s> 'll never go to this hotel again and it wo n't even be in a million years for that matter. </s>
<s> is a hotel that I will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer. </s>
<s> hotel was wonderful ! I am a college student who went with my mom for the weekend and we both liked it ! Pros : THE FRONT DESK and THE STAFF ! - Helpful : Knew great places to eat and HOW to get there Breakfast : Pastries ; coffee ; tea ; muffins ; etc : Fresh Drinks hors d 'oeuvres : Yummy ! Rooms - Clean - Well decorated Lots of people of different ages stayed there Cons : Very very very far from the museums From checkin to departure a poorly run hotel. </s>
<s> took 30 minutes in line to check in because only one clerk was on duty. </s>
<s> person ; perhaps the manager ; was in the back room but never came out to help the check in clerk even as the line grew. </s>
<s> hotels elevators are small resulting in 10 minute waits to get up and down floors ; especially when 1 of the 3 breaks ; as seems to be frequent occurence. </s>
<s> specifically asking for a room away from the elevators ; I was assigned to a room directly across from them ; necessitating another 20 minute wait in line. </s>
<s> room smelled of mildew and water dripped from the ceiling the first night. </s>
<s> requested a news paper be delivered to my room - it appeared on the morning and never again. </s>
<s> ; the hotel is understaffed and poorly trained. </s>
<s> again ! After searching for the perfect hotel for my Chicago getaway I knew once I came across the Hard Rock Hotel ; that this was the hotel for me. </s>
<s> seeing the exceptional accommodations the hotel offered ; I booked my reservations right away. </s>
<s> I arrived at the hotel I was astonished at how beautiful and big the building and grounds were kept. </s>
<s> was greeted warmly by the front staff and received my room key within a few minutes. </s>
<s> was also given helpful pointers to nearby attractions and restaurants. </s>
<s> took the elevator up to my room ; and when I opened the door my jaw dropped as the views of the Chicago skyline was impeccable. </s>
<s> relaxing I went down to the bar for a few cocktails and was impressed by the fast ; courteous service I received. </s>
<s> my cocktail hour ; I decided to unwind and let me tell you the beds must be sent from heaven. </s>
<s> had one of the best nights of sleep I have had in a long time. </s>
<s> highly recommend the Hard Rock as I have stayed at many around the US and this is definitely on my top 5 list. </s>
<s> you all enjoy it as much as I did ; and I ca n't wait to return. </s>
<s> B. </s>
<s> had originally chosen the Conrad Chicago Hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance. </s>
<s> ; I later learned that I had made a poor choice. </s>
<s> arrival ; the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk. </s>
<s> ; when we reached out hotel room ; we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one-bedroom suite. </s>
<s> family went back down to demand another room with two queen-size beds. </s>
<s> clerk ; after a twenty minute waiting period ; was able to find us a suitable room. </s>
<s> entering ; the room was noticably hot. </s>
<s> turned on the air conditioning ; and after waiting for thirty minutes ; the room remained muggy and humid. </s>
<s> called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room. </s>
<s> promised a repairman within ten minutes. </s>
<s> hour later I called again and remined them that the repairman had n't shown up. </s>
<s> once again promised a speedy repair. </s>
<s> waiting ; I discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp. </s>
<s> called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level ; but I had to go get them. </s>
<s> all this trouble ; I argued that they should bring it up to me ; but in the end ; I wound up going to get it myself. </s>
<s> returning to my room and waiting another 30 minutes ; the repair man had not shown up. </s>
<s> I called again ; and within 5 minutes the repairman came. </s>
<s> managed to fix the air conditioner ; but it was about 12am. </s>
<s> were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off ; but as the night went on ; we noticed another problem. </s>
<s> air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds. </s>
<s> also emitted a strange odor. </s>
<s> checking with the front desk ; we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired. </s>
<s> were not available rooms left ; and being so fed up with this hotel 's poor service ; we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel. </s>
<s> do n't recommend the Conrad Chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time. </s>
<s> Hotel Allegro Chicago - The hotel exterior makes it out to be an old cozy hotel which it certainly is not. </s>
<s> decorated the rooms went way over the top trying to incorporate a modern theme. </s>
<s> bathroom was really small ; not to mention very dated considering the amount of renovations to the rest of the room. </s>
<s> am not coming back. </s>
<s> ' taking a cue from david dancer : ' sup ? front desk person : yes ? me : so ; do I have to wait in the elevator line to get up to my room ? front desk person : what room are you in ? me : front desk person : oh. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i 'm afraid so. </s>

<s> : oh ? wtf ! so ; we 're staying at this hotel ; and there is a bar on the 29th floor ; but we have to wait 15 minutes in line to get to our fucking hotel room ? get bent ! we 're paying to stay here ; not just drinking in your bar ! I was consistently disappointed throughout my stay at the James. </s>
<s> had heard from others that it was " agreeable " and " workable " and " all right ; " or even " a nice place. </s>
<s> " 
I figured that there would be no problems and booked a guestroom for a long weekend visit with my long-distance girlfriend. </s>
<s> to the website ; I was about to immerse myself and my date in a bath of cutting-edge contemporary furnishings and " warm tones. </s>
<s> " 
Well ; when I arrived ; I felt like I was in an Ikea showroom just before closing time on a busy day. </s>
<s> in the front was just a bit too askew. </s>
<s> staff were busy ; distracted ; inattentive ; and in every way keen to show me I was a bother to them. </s>
<s> handled my own bags far too much to be convinced of their commitment to my comfort. </s>
<s> also thought my room was quite pathetic for its price. </s>
<s> looked distinctly like someone had rolled around on the beds just before I got there. </s>
<s> bathroom fixtures felt a little bit gross and smelled very strongly ; inexplicably ; of men 's cologne. </s>
<s> cared when I complained of this and suggested that maybe it was just " stuck in my nose " and that it would go away. </s>
<s> ; it did n't ; and I had a horrible headache by the time my lady arrived. </s>
<s> ruined my entire first evening in Chicago. </s>
<s> my price I could have stayed a week at an economy hotel ; gotten my personal items treated for bedbugs ; and still saved money. </s>
<s> I would not have been treated like such a pest. </s>
<s> to say ; I will be looking elsewhere when I go back to Chicago. </s>
<s> may not be a frequent patron of luxury hotels ; but I know when I am wasting my money. </s>
<s> Omni Chicago- The Omni Chicago Hotel was one of the worst hotels I 've stayed in ! My husband and I went there last week for three days and we had a terrible experience. </s>
<s> dining room looked elegant and the food looked delicious ; but when we sat down for dinner I thought my chair was going to break ! Everything was cheap and old looking. </s>
<s> I ordered a vegetarian meal ; they gave me fish that was still cold and beans that were burnt. </s>
<s> the room looked elegant on the pictures ; I noticed that they had n't vacuumed under the table or the beds. </s>
<s> even found a sock from a previous guest in the closet ! The bathroom was too small and smelt moldy. </s>
<s> indoor pool was very crowded after dinner and was definitely not large enough for a hotel with 347 rooms. </s>
<s> were going to talk a walk along Michigan Avenue ; but when we got outside we noticed the lights on the sidewalk were n't working and it was completely dark. </s>
<s> will definitely never stay at the Hotel Omni Chicago again ! The Ambassador East is located in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago. </s>
<s> is just a few blocks from the train station ; so it was easy to get anywhere in town. </s>
<s> hotel is a National Historic Landmark so the lobby is elegant and beautiful. </s>
<s> loved the Pump Room bar with tons of B W photos of celebrities. </s>
<s> service was wonderful and everyone was friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> centrally located in the Loop directly south of the 7th Day Adventist Church ' my room looked down upon Wacker Drive ; the aforementioned church and the Chicago River. </s>
<s> room ; virtually no storage space. </s>
<s> a conference with the Monaco as venue. </s>
<s> provided adequate service ; with no problems. </s>
<s> was the first time I spent with a Kimpton Hotel and I registered for their Frequent Stay program. </s>
<s> never felt comfortable in this hotel. </s>
<s> 'm 60 yrs old and it appears the clientele they target is half my age. </s>
<s> front deskperson of unidentifiable gender. </s>
<s> young people can have at it. </s>
<s> 'll stay at the Marriott Michigan Ave next time. </s>
<s> was here on a weekend when there must have been a big convention or something ; because I could n't get a room at The James ; where I usually stay. </s>
<s> in ; the lobby was gaudy and poorly lit ; and the line to check in took forever. </s>
<s> elevators were tiny ; and about five more people than could actually fit squeezed their way in just before the door closed. </s>
<s> chair in the room was uncomfortable and really low to the ground- I had to pull my husband up out of it. </s>
<s> bathroom did n't have a bathtub ; only a shower ; and almost no room to put my toiletries to keep them organized. </s>
<s> fitness center has mirrors everywhere to make it look big ; but there were only about four treadmills ; and you bet that every single one was full whenever I tried to make it down there for exercise. </s>
<s> 's a bit closer to the Loop than the James ; but that did n't make up for its other problems. </s>
<s> wo n't be returning. </s>
<s> daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. </s>
<s> we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. </s>
<s> then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool ; one white phone and one emergency red phone ; to call the desk. </s>
<s> were out of service ! I am glad there was n't an emergency. </s>
<s> we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean . </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  never heard back. </s>
<s> room was very spacious with very nice ; colorful decorating. </s>
<s> beds felt like lying on a cloud ; and there were four pillows on each bed ; two fiberfill and two down so you could choose which you like better. </s>
<s> bathroom was very nice also. </s>
<s> ; I was very pleased with the stay. </s>
<s> had to show your room key to get in after ten p. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> thought that was a good security issue. </s>
<s> has a great location too ; close to downtown. </s>
<s> would recommend it. </s>
<s> decorations were very classy. </s>
<s> hotels have two of the same framed art ; boring bedspreads and lumpy pillows. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency was just the opposite. </s>
<s> Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago- This hotel is fairly nice and has the expected accomodation for the price. </s>
<s> ; I booked this at the last moment and did n't have much chance to shop around for other deals. </s>
<s> the price ; there might be better alternatives. </s>
<s> was approximately $ 200 a night for a spacious studio room. </s>
<s> complaint however is that I was put into a room with renovations being done in the hallways. </s>
<s> created a nauseating smell everytime I left the room. </s>
<s> ; the staff was very nice and supported my needs. </s>
<s> had an interview the next day and the hotel was nice enough to provide shuttle service. </s>
<s> breakfast too was great ! It was n't just continental but had eggs and sausage and an assortment of pastries and beverages. </s>
<s> even had a computer room and printer for my printing needs. </s>
<s> a chance I would go back again ; assuming that I get assigned to a hallway not under renovation. </s>
<s> was a refreshing change from the ordinary. </s>
<s> loved the location ; the service and the amenities offered by this hotel. </s>

<s> loved having goldfish share our room ! I would definitely stay here again. </s>
<s> is one of our favorite cities to visit. </s>

<s> now runs the hotel restaurant. </s>
<s> enjoyed having breakfast there. </s>
<s> will stay there again. </s>
<s> and over-priced. </s>
<s> fact that they have a complimentary wine reception every night at 5 doesnt take away from the fact that they have terrible beds and the place isnt as clean as it should be for a 4 star hotel. </s>
<s> hallways smelled like a dog parlor and the carpets in my room look like they had n't been cleaned . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> well ; ever. </s>
<s> decorative pillows on my bed were so filthy they were actually stained brown and looked like they had been sitting outside for everyone to use and then put back on my bed. </s>
<s> decor of the hotel was nice and eclectic but it wasnt enough to convince me to ever stay here again. </s>
<s> bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have every tried to sleep on. </s>
<s> couldnt sleep the whole week that I stayed there. </s>
<s> was hard and lumpy and the pillows were tiny. </s>
<s> final say is that it is an over priced Holiday Inn . </s>

<s> 
Very nice hotel ; better than expected. </s>
<s> hot breakfast is great in the morning ; but the Dinner at night goes above and beyond ' even free wine ! The rooms are pretty good size ; well furnished ; and clean. </s>
<s> liked the view from my room. </s>
<s> used the fitness center and although did not have everything I would have liked ; was adequate. </s>
<s> will say the pool is really nice and offers a pretty sweet view. </s>
<s> staff was friendly and helpful ; being my first time in Chicago they were able to point me in the right direction and saved me some frustration. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> was REALLY looking forward to a nice relaxing stay at the end of a long vacation ; but unfortunately that was not to be had. </s>
<s> the moment we arrived at the Omni ; the staff was belligerent and extremely rude. </s>
<s> had lost our reservation and refused to give us the rate we had booked before. </s>
<s> we were n't so tired ; we would 've gone to a different hotel right then ; but hindsight is 20 '20. </s>
<s> we FINALLY got checked in after being made to wait needlessly for 45 minutes in the lobby ; we decided to go down to the pool ; which was tiny and kind of dirty ; so we had walked all the way down there in our suits for nothing. </s>
<s> internet access was really slow. </s>
<s> will NEVER stay here again. </s>
<s> yourself the headache and book somewhere else ! I recently stayed at this hotel with my family ' 10-1 10-3. </s>
<s> had a terrific experience. </s>
<s> landed the hotel through Priceline for $ 80 per night and paid an additional $ 75 per night for a suite on the 41st floor. </s>
<s> two young boys loved it as the view was unbelieveable and the pool on the 42nd floor was easily accessible. </s>
<s> found all the employees that we interfaced with to be very friendly and accommodating. </s>
<s> would love to stay here again. </s>
<s> HO HI HO ; off to Chicago we go. </s>
<s> 's the skinny ; if you 're hoping to run into a washed up rock star ' CeCe Deville for us ; and no the teenagers had no idea who he was you may want to spend your hard earned money here. </s>
<s> took my younger sister and a couple of her friends ' teenagers for an overnighter in Chicago on our way to Wisconsin. </s>
<s> chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance. </s>
<s> mean come on it is supposed to be " COOL " . </s>
<s> it wasn 't. </s>
<s> Positives : ' It is in the Carbon Carbide Building ; which is beautiful. </s>
<s> The location : it sits in the middle of everything ' The lobby has two computers for guest use. </s>
<s> The fitness center is very nice. </s>
<s> machines have individual TV 's and there are head phones in case you forgot yours. </s>
<s> have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack. </s>
<s> Check-in and out was quick and Valet was very courteous. </s>
<s> Negatives : ' The rooms were small and ours was n't clean ' pistachio shells on the floor. </s>
<s> rooms were painted purplish gray ' we were on the Prince floor with a picture of Bob Marley hanging on one of the walls. </s>
<s> girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows. </s>
<s> Bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub. </s>
<s> The cable reception was poor ; I kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture. </s>
<s> It is n't anywhere near the Hard Rock Cafe. </s>
<s> There was very little memorabilia. </s>
<s> There is no pool ; and yes I knew this when I made the reservation. </s>
<s> wrap it up ; I wo n't be staying here again. </s>
<s> I am going to drop almost 4 Benjamins on a hotel room ; I will stay at the Palmer House Hilton. </s>
<s> that is a whole different review. </s>
<s> stayed at the Sheraton by Navy Pier the first weekend of November and were very pleased with the accommodations and the service. </s>
<s> were upgraded to club level rooms and stayed in 3114 and 3115 adjoining. </s>
<s> view from both rooms was spectacular ' as you can tell from the picture attached. </s>
<s> also left a plate of cookies and treats in the kids room upon check-in which made us all feel very special. </s>
<s> hotel is central to both Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> so we walked ; trolleyed ; and cabbed all around the area. </s>
<s> ate the breakfast buffet both mornings and thought it was pretty good. </s>
<s> eggs were a little runny ; but they happily made a different batch for us at the omelet station. </s>
<s> six year old ate free and our two eleven year olds were $ 14 ' instead of the adult $ 20 The rooms were clean ; the concierge reception staff were both friendly and helpful . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> we will definitely visit this Sheraton again when we 're in Chicago next time. </s>
<s> was initially excited when I found out that my employer was sending me to Chicago on business ; but I could never have imagined the frustration and irritation that would be heaped on me by the inept staff of The James Chicago. </s>
<s> I arrived ; my reservation could not be found in their system ; although I had made it myself. </s>
<s> some words with the manager on duty ; Mr. </s>
<s> Chad Montgomery ; I was given a room at the previously agreed upon rate. </s>
<s> can make a mistake ; so I was n't too angry at that point. </s>
<s> room was bland and colorless ; in spite of The James boasts of their attention to design and detail. </s>
<s> room was mostly clean ; but after seeing the stains on the bedding ; I am not convinced that they were washed after the room 's last occupant. </s>
<s> attended a stressful business meeting in The Dining Room that night ; complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy ; disgruntled waitstaff. </s>
<s> I decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order. </s>
<s> was assured that I would enjoy " Asha 's Purifying Shower Ritual " ; which would primarily take place in my own room. </s>
<s> shower was okay ; but I think I must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided ; because I broke out in hives all over my body. </s>
<s> came the " in-room " portion. </s>
<s> I was in the shower ; five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room. </s>
<s> guess they were supposed to make it smell good ; but I began choking on the odor the minute I walked in the room. </s>
<s> masseuse directed me to lie on the bed for the next portion ; but his hands wandered a little too much for my liking. </s>
<s> am sure certain areas are NOT on the massage menu. </s>
<s> closing ; if you have ever considered staying at The James Chicago ; I beg of you to reconsider. </s>
<s> only a handful of positive things to say about the hotel ; and a suitcase full of negative ' including a pending court case against the masseuse ; I can almost guarantee you would regret staying there. </s>
<s> know I do. </s>
<s> Suites Chicago I travel to Chicago a lot and have never been as impressed with a hotel as I am with Homewood Suites Chicago. </s>
<s> I stepped into my room ; I was immediately hit with the Chicago skyline. </s>
<s> was easily accessible in the wonderful restaurant next to the lobby. </s>
<s> took my family to the Affinia Chicago for a short vacation last summer and it was fabulous. </s>
<s> kids say that their favorite part was the pool and the fact that the amusement park is really close by. </s>
<s> wife was really stoked with Spaffina. </s>
<s> pampering and really made her feel special. </s>
<s> they are very attentive to pets also. </s>
<s> dog we left home but he would have been stoked with the pets amenities and attention. </s>
<s> hotel is also connected to a ton of other hotels ; so their Stash award lets you earn points at a lot of other hotels also. </s>
<s> favorite part of all was that my family was happy and content ; which left me free to go over to Underground Wonderbar for a nice cocktail. </s>
<s> most people think Hilton ; they think luxury. </s>
<s> know I did. </s>
<s> only wish I 'd been half right. </s>
<s> arriving ; I was informed that the incompetent staff had lost my reservation entirely. </s>
<s> a very auspicious start ; but they did find me another room. </s>
<s> ; the new room had an oh-so-scenic view of the broadside of an adjacent building. </s>
<s> ; fine. </s>
<s> was willing to let this slide. </s>
<s> did n't want to be difficult. </s>
<s> the following days of my stay ; it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the Hilton very undeserving of the term ; luxury hotel. </s>
<s> neighbors. </s>
<s> staff. </s>
<s> the state of my bathroom towels was anything to go by upon checkout ; I doubt my sheets were changed even once. </s>
<s> time I 'll ignore the hype and stay somewhere cheaper. </s>
<s> service could n't possibly be worse. </s>
<s> from the location ; great ; but it stops there. </s>
<s> check-in ; I was informed I would have a queen bed. </s>
<s> asked for a king size bed ; and I was told there would be a charge for going up to a king. </s>
<s> ME A BREAK ; a surcharge for going from a queen to a king. </s>
<s> I got up to the room ; it was like a oven. </s>
<s> could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service. </s>
<s> in the room had a charge associated to it ; even down to the coffee ; $ 1. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> what 's up with that ? I was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom. </s>
<s> small. </s>
<s> have stayed there twice and with so many other options ; I feel this will be my last. </s>
<s> no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas. </s>
<s> notably is cleanliness ; as although the lobby was very clean ; the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not. </s>
<s> lined the carpeted floor for the hallways ; and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time. </s>
<s> furnishings were nice and modern ; but with various blemishes upon close inspection. </s>
<s> was relatively clean ; with the exception of the shower. </s>
<s> was nice for this particular room ; and service was relatively quick. </s>
<s> food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue. </s>
<s> time with the glasses which were stained ; the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel. </s>
<s> will not make the mistake of staying here again. </s>
<s> first entering the hotel ; we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful bellmen I have ever encountered. </s>
<s> our 2 week stay ; they told us to " have a nice day " as we left in the AM and welcomed us back upon our return. </s>
<s> is served in the AM ; and the servers were as delightful as the bellmen. </s>
<s> was a very enjoyable stay. </s>
<s> was really an unexpected experience for me as far as hotel accommodations go. </s>
<s> this week 's vacation in Chicago ; I heard several recommendations regarding lodging ; but the James Chicago was mentioned most emphatically. </s>
<s> expected an experience of comfort ; luxury and customer satisfaction ; but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of innovation and forward-thinking employed by every aspect of this hotel. </s>
<s> design is breathtaking -- modern ; clean ; stylish ; sexy -- and its reflected everywhere from the lobby ; shops and restaurants ; to the stunning guest rooms themselves. </s>
<s> family and I felt energized by the smartly sleek environment we were in ; and were impressed at every turn by the sophisticated take on hotel decor. </s>
<s> from a traditional hotel experience ; this was like moving into chic ; exclusive downtown apartment ; and truly an upscale adventure in modern luxury living. </s>
<s> ; too ; was the hotel 's overall approach to its guests and its use of the world 's resources. </s>
<s> its offer of in-room recycling to the available bicycles for guest usage ; the James offers a unique perspective on its place in the world ; and gently helps its guests assist in maintaining that balance with ease and elegance. </s>
<s> 's a respect that shows through ; too ; in other areas : support for artistic organizations ; charities and other programs of merit ; as well as Chicago-centric packages compiled for guests so they can make the best of their stay ; whether for a weekend ; a week ; or longer. </s>
<s> James Chicago will definitely be our choice for accommodations whenever we revisit Chicago. </s>
<s> fact ; we may visit again solely to stay at the James ! I stayed in this hotel for 5 days in November together with my colleagues. </s>
<s> only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day. </s>
<s> fridge or microwave included in the price. </s>
<s> room had two too soft full size beds. </s>
<s> the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall. </s>
<s> doesnt believe it ; check out the 16th floor close to room 212. </s>
<s> discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous. </s>
<s> stayed in the Hyatt Regency before for much cheaper and that was way better. </s>
<s> restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty ; but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served. </s>
<s> stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby. </s>
<s> Chicago - I may be biased because my expectation for this Hilton hotel was high ; but $ 150 a night for an ordinary hotel room with no extra special services seems a bit pricey for me. </s>
<s> from the price ; the noise was also a big issue for me. </s>
<s> could n't get enough sleep with all the noise coming from traffic in the morning. </s>
<s> stayed for just one night ; but the hotel staff was extremely friendly and polite. </s>
<s> rooms were clean and large. </s>
<s> decor had just been redone. </s>
<s> best perks were the complimentary continental breakfast on each floor in the morning and the free cocktail hour with premium drinks and great appetizers at night. </s>
<s> got a great rate and would go back. </s>
<s> location for walking around. </s>
<s> do I start. </s>
<s> GM was a nice guy for handling the incident I had. </s>
<s> - the Concierge - set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable. </s>
<s> said he knew this spa and it was nice. </s>
<s> set me up and quoted me a price of $ 125 ; When i got to the spa ' which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was $ 100 with 20 % off. </s>
<s> the end of the massage I gave the lady $ 100 and said thanks you can keep the change ; She insisted that I got " A Hotel Rate " because Anthony set me up. </s>
<s> called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference - $ 45. </s>
<s> then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I declined. </s>
<s> short - shady dealings with this place. </s>
<s> was quite taken back. </s>
<s> GM Selman comp 'd me a night but ; I felt swindled big time. </s>
<s> somewhere else. </s>
<s> concierge has something going on . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
We stayed at Amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more. </s>
<s> 's a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but it 's just not worth the money. </s>
<s> does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast. </s>
<s> sheets though ; made us itch for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things. </s>
<s> breakfast could really benefit from some bagels or yougurt. </s>
<s> ; it 's just an early morning sugar attach of muffins ; danishes ; sweet breads ; and croissants. </s>
<s> are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain variety ; if you are into that sort of thing. </s>
<s> ; the windows do not open and there is a climate control device in the room. </s>
<s> problem with it that it keeps blowing air all the time ; alternating between cold and warm ; right over the bed. </s>
<s> is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale. </s>
<s> do have a business center where you can send fax and use internet for free. </s>
<s> problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there. </s>
<s> person at a time . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
All and all ; we will not stay there again. </s>
<s> we feel like luxury ; we have to find some other place. </s>
<s> if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city ; maybe we will try Red Roof Inn or something like that. </s>
<s> least we 'll know what we are paying for. </s>
<s> staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently ; I was nothing but disappointed. </s>
<s> " luxury hotel " obviously spends too much money on their marketing to convince people how luxurious they are and not enough on actually making their hotel comfortable. </s>
<s> I arrived ; my hotel room was devoid of towels ; and after calling down to the front desk ; it took three hours and two more calls to finally get some fresh towels delivered. </s>
<s> top of that ; when I went to connect to the internet in my room ; the wifi signal was too weak and I was forced to go out into the hall to connect with my laptop ! For the exorbitant price they charged me for one night in their " superior corner suite " ; I could have stayed a week at a Holiday Inn ; and after this stay ; I wish I had. </s>
<s> for a week last month. </s>
<s> n't beat the location - close to the Magnificent Mile ; Attractions ; Tours ; Great Restaurants Night Life. </s>
<s> spent a lot of nights in other Homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels. </s>
<s> the room was ok ; not great. </s>
<s> in my opinion. </s>
<s> staff to be uninterested and not very helpful. </s>
<s> to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less. </s>
<s> during the week as other guests were made to wait as well. </s>
<s> was the same stuff day after day. </s>
<s> the week went on ; they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished ' weekly delivery I guess. </s>
<s> ; the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant. </s>
<s> for work ' sales and frequently stay in hotels. </s>
<s> with family every year and also stay in hotels. </s>
<s> is roughing it for me . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> not a camper. </s>
<s> come to Chicago again ; but would not stay here. </s>
<s> are too many other options worth investigating. </s>
<s> have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok. </s>
<s> main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center ; which is truly annoying. </s>
<s> addition ; there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator. </s>
<s> than that ; it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm. </s>
<s> ; the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable. </s>
<s> door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk ; and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed. </s>
<s> was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed ; so they shoved it off to the side. </s>
<s> 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel. </s>
<s> should not be sold as a hotel room. </s>
<s> Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago- Horrible service. </s>
<s> and lacking in service. </s>
<s> are much better places to go in town. </s>
<s> I first heard about this place ; I had my doubts but decided to bite the bullet and go for the pricy choice. </s>
<s> was on a trip with family and wanted to splurge on the accomodations. </s>
<s> ; when I came to the hotel ; my expectations were far from being met. </s>
<s> pictures posted online were deceptive and hid most of the flaws in the hotel. </s>
<s> bathroom had mold all over and was really disgusting ! I asked for a new room but was rudely denied. </s>
<s> people only care about profit and not the service. </s>
<s> you are considering to room here ; do n't ! Do yourself a favor and go to the hotel next doors. </s>
<s> 's much better and is actually cheaper. </s>
<s> next day ; I left the hotel and went next doors ! I just enjoyed a 3-day weekend at the Swissotel Chicago. </s>
<s> friend of mine booked it and got a GREAT rate. </s>
<s> than even a fleabag motel. </s>
<s> keep an eye out for specials. </s>
<s> view was great ; the location was prime. </s>
<s> staff was helpful. </s>
<s> room was large ' we had 2 double beds. </s>
<s> only have one complaint. </s>
<s> room was next to some sort of storage or mechanical room where employees ' I think would sneak off to talk on the phone. </s>
<s> sound came right though the vent in our bathroom and we could hear them plain-as-day. </s>
<s> ; the sound was only in the bathroom so it was n't like it kept us up at night. </s>
<s> was just a little weird. </s>
<s> ; a great stay and I will definitely stay there again. </s>
<s> wife and I stayed at the Abassador East Hotel in August to attend the Air and Water Show in Chicago. </s>
<s> called ahead to ensure a SW view that would allow us to watch the airshow from our room if the weather did not permit us to watch from one of the nearby beaches. </s>
<s> arrival at the hotel ; not only was our room on the west side of the hotel it was n't even a single king as was requested. </s>
<s> the hotel had overbooked king rooms for the event weekend and we were downgraded to a queen room. </s>
<s> room itself was small and underwhelming. </s>
<s> was not dirty ; but the linens and furnishings all had a very old and worn feel. </s>
<s> hotel was packed the weekend we visited. </s>
<s> staff was obviously not prepared to cater to such a large crowd. </s>
<s> concierge and reception desks were continuously busy. </s>
<s> hotel restaurant was very slow and had long waits. </s>
<s> main lobby and other common areas throughout the hotel were also undergoing renovations making getting around and fighting crowds of other people even more difficult ! Luckly the weather was nice and the airshow was enjoyable. </s>
<s> will not be staying at the Abassador on future trips. </s>
<s> ; current renovations will provide a much needed lift to the hotels current worn down vibe . </s>

Sofitel not-so-luxury Hotels I recently checked out from a short stay at the chicago water tower. </s>
<s> originally planned to stay for a week but as my business was concluded after only 3 days I decided I had had my share of the water tower. </s>
<s> put it offered no reasons to stay. </s>
<s> Hotel is quite lovely and elegantly dressed to impress ; but little more is put forth to sway the more acquainted crowed. </s>
<s> First night was a spectacle meal and there was quite a crowd ; I think for the weekend. </s>
<s> next night the food was only mediocre and the third when I orderd room service I had to call twice. </s>
<s> if you do n't care about the food I think you would be wise to think twice about your stay if you have the choice. </s>
<s> put on quite a show ; but that is all and when the show ended I was still hungry for more and there was no more to be found. </s>
<s> am staying here now and actually am compelled to write this review before I fall asleep. </s>
<s> front desk staff were brief and one of them was chatting with her friend ' gossiping as I checked in ' VERY unprofessional. </s>
<s> room she offered me was on a ' high floor ' 5th . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
HA and when I checked in there was a big bag of grapes left behind by the previous guest on the window sill and some of the previous guests hair in the bathtub . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> I was DONE. </s>
<s> down and had them re-clean the room ; they made no offer to compensate or upgrade . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> not even a bottle of wine. </s>
<s> front desk clerk suggested I come down and get a key to another room ' like I have time for that. </s>
<s> as I do like Kimpton hotels and am a Kimpton In Touch member ' btw they 've done away with the amenities . </s>

<s> you just get a free item from the mini bar. </s>
<s> my arrival at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago I had to wait to be helped by a bellman for 10 minutes while I waited outside in the towncar. </s>
<s> bellman that ended up assisting me dropped two of my suitcases as he pushed his cart through the lobby. </s>
<s> front desk service rep was busy on the phone when I approched and raised a finger to me to hold on while she finished her call. </s>

<s> called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep. </s>
<s> that I had previously checked in with told me that there wer n't anymore available rooms. </s>
<s> told me that I needed to come back down to the lobby. </s>
<s> I approched the desk I heard her yelling at a housekeeper. </s>
<s> then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready. </s>
<s> did n't have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so I just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned. </s>
<s> I was waiting I watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge - why was I not given that suite after what I just went through ? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready. </s>
<s> went back up to the same room that I had previously entered. </s>
<s> was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels. </s>
<s> called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items. </s>
<s> my stay was n't already horrible enough after I changed and went down to the 312 retaurant connected to the hotel I ended up having to wait 30 minutes after the reservation I had made to be seated. </s>
<s> meal was ok but nothing like I had expected it to be when I read about it online. </s>
<s> can honestly say I will never be returning to this hotel nor this restaurant. </s>
<s> location is the only thing that matters ; stay at the Talbott. </s>
<s> ; my wife and I have travelled extensively throughout North America and Europe ; and I have never ; in my entire life ; seen such an inept housekeeping staff. </s>
<s> are unprofessional ; noisy ; incompetent and better suited for a one star hotel. </s>
<s> were yelling in the halls ; slamming doors ; and taking far too long to clean each room. </s>
<s> come to your room several times to check the fridge where they sell bottles of water for $ 3. </s>
<s> hotel was being renovated when we were staying there so we also had to endure the construction work - no discount was offered even after we complained several times. </s>
<s> front desk staff was very polite ; but who cares ?They 're supposed to be nice. </s>
<s> spent a lot of money to stay here and did not feel that I received a fair deal. </s>
<s> room was sub-par for the price ; even for an inner city hotel. </s>

<s> up an important meeting for some clients at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. </s>
<s> were flying to Chicago for a special trip to checkout the music scene and to discuss business with my company. </s>
<s> ; they wanted to stay here. </s>
<s> client really seemed to like their rooms ; but felt the Paul Reed Smith room was too cramped for our day-long meeting ' 330 sq ft . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
In a panic ; I contacted the HRH staff and they actually had another ; bigger ; room available. </s>
<s> quickly moved our meeting in the Birdland room for the rest of the day and the meeting was a rousing success. </s>

<s> '
We have a new client and so does HRH. </s>
<s> is where the client wants to stay every time they fly in for future business meetings with us. </s>
<s> ; rude ; rude ! We stayed here on July 4th weekend. </s>
<s> drove from Michigan ; we called customer service to get directions from I-95 w 'c is a major highway to Chicago -- calling them from a cellphone ; telling them we 're in a middle of a storm and that we 're lost . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> we were put on hold ; forwarded to another person who did not know how to get to the hotel and we were on hold again. </s>
<s> up we decided to just exit the highway and try our luck at a 7-11 store. </s>
<s> we finally arrived at the hotel at 2 am no one was there to take care of our car so we looked for parking ourselves. </s>
<s> in we were not greeted by anyone ; even the receptionist did not greet us ! no welcome to the knickerbocker ; nothing ! The man at the reception was rude ; which makes me think what kind of customer service training this hotel has. </s>
<s> guy could not find our reservation and he seemed frustrated that we are checking-in at 2 am ! Well if they were able to give us directions maybe we would have been there 2 hours earlier. </s>
<s> room is not even spectacular ; very small ; probably a little bigger than a walk-in closet. </s>
<s> here at your own risk. </s>
<s> ! I was swept away when I walked into the hotel it was gorgeous. </s>
<s> staff was very nice and helpful the hotel was very clean ; and the food was delicious. </s>
<s> stayed two nights and the first night we went to the Lockwood restaurant and we were blown away by the food. </s>
<s> has to be the best food in Chicago the atmosphere was very classy and warm and the wait staff was very precise. </s>
<s> decor in our rooms did not look like any hotel I had been at they were very elegant and inviting. </s>
<s> can not wait to go back it is a true escape from daily life. </s>
<s> travelled to Illinois from the UK on business ; and booked Friday and Saturday night at the Homewood Suites so that I could have a weekend in the city. </s>
<s> location was perfect ; walking distance to Michigan Ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff ; and literally 100 yards to the L ' red line for getting out to the surrounding areas. </s>
<s> room was great : not exactly ' wow decor but clean and really well stocked. </s>
<s> was expecting a ' suite to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area. </s>
<s> was actually a 3-room mini-apartment ; with an open lounge 'kitchen ; bedroom ; and bathroom. </s>

<s> out my first impression was correct ; this is the LEAST friendly hotel I 've ever been in ! Even the concierge was rude and disagreeable. </s>

<s> was a beautiful view of the river ' especially with the multiple rows of windows and nearby parks ; the service was timely and luxurious ; and the meeting rooms for business were large ; spacious ; and made of svelte woods. </s>

<s> do not recommend this place at all. </s>
<s> Chicago Hotel - This hotel is a dump. </s>
<s> had really high expectations from the reviews I read before booking a room. </s>
<s> to say ; I was extremely disappointed. </s>
<s> bathroom is really small ; the beds are n't adequate in either size or comfort and the management is rude and condescending. </s>
<s> website claims that that it is in the middle of downtown Chicago but it is at least 5 blocks away from the heart of the city. </s>
<s> thought I was paying a reasonable amount for a decent place ; I was sorely disappointed. </s>
<s> away from this place ! DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL ! I would have certainly expected more from the Hilton ; especially due to the price I paid for my room and the way the hotel is portrayed. </s>
<s> arriving at the hotel I found only one receptionist working and she was too busy texting on her mobile phone to check me in ! I had to wait 15 mins before checking in and she made me feel like I was inconveniencing her ! When I finally got into my room I was appalled. </s>
<s> had a non smoking reservation and the room stank of smoke and there were several visible cigarette burns in the comforter and the carpet. </s>
<s> called down to reception and to confirm that I was in a non smoking room ; which I was advised that I was. </s>
<s> had to argue with the receptionist over the room for 10 mins before she agreed to switch my room for another one. </s>
<s> I entered my new room ; I found that once again it stank of smoke ; but after being too exhausted from my flight I decided that I would sort it out with reception in the morning. </s>
<s> IDEA ! I curled up and went to sleep and awoke to the go to the bathroom around 2am where I noticed my legs were COVERED in red welts ! I immediately rushed back into the bedroom and through back the covers to find my bed teaming with bed bugs. </s>
<s> packed my stuff and checked out that night ; however a refund was refused. </s>
<s> have since contacted the head office and I am awaiting a response. </s>
<s> NOT STAY HERE ! I love this hotel. </s>
<s> is one of the best that I have stayed in. </s>
<s> lobby was beautiful and the room was nice and comfortable. </s>
<s> made services was terrific. </s>
<s> matter what time we left the room it was made up when we came back. </s>
<s> asked the maid for a couple of extras and she was very nice and friendly. </s>
<s> is what I liked about the hotel the staff was so nice and friendly. </s>
<s> was there with my daughter for a girl 's weekend from Thursday - Sunday. </s>
<s> from the doorman to the concierge to the people at the desk etc. </s>
<s> was wonderful. </s>
<s> ca n't say enough good about this hotel. </s>
<s> the bathroom was small ; but I was n't moving into the room. </s>
<s> was just staying there a few days and was hardly in the room anyway. </s>
<s> will definitely stay there again My wife and I were very much looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago. </s>
<s> had been looking forward to a romantic getaway. </s>
<s> have to say Hotel Allegro was a disappointment for both of us. </s>
<s> is a pet friendly hotel - we knew that going in. </s>
<s> we were shocked by the fact that we found pet hair around the room we were given. </s>
<s> the carpet and even an amount on the bed cover. </s>
<s> shocking for the price we were paying. </s>
<s> we called the front desk it took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to stop by. </s>
<s> this - the room itself - it has flair I guess ; but I ca n't imagine it is the right flair for many. </s>
<s> colorings used a bright blue on the bed and a muted yellow ; designy wallpaper. </s>
<s> myself or my wife found it relaxing at all. </s>
<s> ca n't imagine many would. </s>
<s> really was off-putting. </s>
<s> ; the experience was a check minus in my book. </s>
<s> not be looking to return any time soon. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Sheraton for an onsite conference ; and had problems from the getgo. </s>
<s> had problems with the check-in even though I had made arrangements beforehand to pay by company check and they have a credit card on file. </s>
<s> front desk clerks were kind of rude. </s>
<s> room was okay ; not worth what I paid for. </s>
<s> sheets were kind of messed up and the room did n't feel very clean. </s>
<s> also charge for internet access ; which is ridiculous. </s>
<s> hotels provide free wi-fi. </s>
<s> conference food ; which I assume is catered by the hotel ; was not good at all. </s>
<s> the day of the check out ; I had arranged for a late check-out ; but in the morning before check-out time ; someone else got assigned to my room and was attempting to get in ! Then they locked me out of my room with my luggage still in there before my check out time. </s>
<s> in all ; I would recommend staying somewhere else. </s>
<s> had a great stay at the Monaco last Fall with friends ; I was disappointed ' initially to arrive on Saturday with husband and find that they did n't have our Quikbook made reservation in their system and they had no rooms available for Sat. </s>
<s> eve. </s>
<s> they immediately took responsibility for their mistake by doing the following : found us a nice room at the neighboring Swissotel and paid for it ! Gave us cab fare to get the 4 blocks over there. </s>
<s> for our valet parking $ 33 that eve. </s>
<s> naturally when they asked if we were interested in returning for Sunday eve ' when they did have room ; we said yes. </s>
<s> we returned ; they gave us a corner suite with jacuzzi tub for our $ 139 quikbook rate ! Now that 's what I call a recovery ! Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay. </s>
<s> hotel 's five-star rating needs a downgrade ! When I visited this hotel 14 years ago ; The Fairmont was among the classiest brands. </s>
<s> more. </s>
<s> 29th floor room was expansive ; but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working. </s>
<s> upholstery was frayed ; the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water ; and the room 's door did n't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. </s>
<s> ; the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you ; with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. </s>
<s> was like sleeping in an old vending machine ; but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message ; there was none to be found. </s>
<s> reviewers remarked that this hotel " needs updating ; " but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame. </s>
<s> instance ; someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations. </s>
<s> could n't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space would n't accommodate my legs. </s>
<s> I am not unusually tall. </s>
<s> '
There are so many great hotels in Chicago that deserve five stars ; that the Fairmont should n't be able to compete. </s>
<s> my profile for better ideas. </s>
<s> For the amount of money per night that the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel charges ; one would at least expect a room with a working bathroom. </s>
<s> toilet would n't flush ; the sink dripped and the towels were rough and cheap looking. </s>
<s> I called the front desk to ask for maintenance on the sink and toilet ; the staff were indifferent. </s>
<s> was over an hour before anyone arrived to fix the bathroom fixtures ; and when they did arrive they were unable to stop the drip in the sink. </s>
<s> in all ; I was disappointed with my stay. </s>
<s> James Chicago hotel was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. </s>
<s> only good thing about it was that it was located downtown ; so I was n't forced to stay in it any longer than I had to. </s>
<s> receptionist was rude and snobby ; my room had dirty towels in it ; and i found numerous small insects in my room. </s>
<s> ; the gym and spa were closed while I was there. </s>
<s> was done by management to accommodate me for these inconveniences. </s>
<s> time I will take my business elsewhere. </s>
<s> loved this hotel and would definitely come back. </s>
<s> we were n't given a goldfish ; which was disappointing ; but then we left a tip for the housekeeper ; and she rewarded us with one. </s>
<s> had fun sipping wine and playing Wii in the lobby every afternoon. </s>
<s> staff were quite friendly and helpful ; even printing our boarding passes for us. </s>
<s> room was very comfortable ; with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper. </s>
<s> first we were worried about noise ; since our room was next to the elevator ; but we hardly heard it ; and did n't notice any street noise either. </s>
<s> hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated ; well-lit ; and ideally located. </s>
<s> me first start by saying I have always been pleased with the Conrad hotels and that is why I chose the Conrad Chicago. </s>
<s> was very disappointed in the level of service. </s>
<s> phone calls to get maintenance to fix the bathroom sink ; unpleasant experience in the Terrace resturant ; front desk not aware of room eminities ; and a very uncaring MOD ! All the Conrad hotels I have stayed at have been 5 STAR but not this one. </s>
<s> have to give it 2 stars ! : I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers in December of last year and had one of my worst hotel experiences ever. </s>
<s> ; when I went to check in ; I was completely ignored by the staff ; they were rude and seemed to have better things to do than help me check in. </s>
<s> I got to my room ; all the way on the 23rd floor ; the room was dirty and had not been cleaned. </s>
<s> back down to the lobby and they seemed to feel it was no big deal and gave me another room. </s>
<s> went back to check and the new room was dirty also. </s>
<s> were pubic hairs on the bed and in the bathroom. </s>
<s> appeared the maid only went into the room and picked up trash and made the bed but did not clean. </s>
<s> I can say is YUCK ! My next visit to the lobby the staff gave me an attitude about having to transfer me to another room AGAIN ! Extremely poor customer service and gross rooms. </s>
<s> felt like I was staying at a $ 30 a night roach motel ; not the $ 250 a night Sheraton. </s>
<s> advise is to stay away. </s>
<s> just returned from a weekend at the Palmer House. </s>
<s> normally stay north on the Mag Mile but wanted to be closer to Soldier 's Stadium and the Art Insitiute this time. </s>
<s> were able to upgrade to a suite upon arrival at half the price that we paid for a regular room at the Four Seasons two weeks earlier. </s>
<s> a suite ! It was huge. </s>
<s> basic living room ; dining room and kitchen 'wet bar area was one large room. </s>
<s> to three additional bedrooms can be added by the use of connecting doors. </s>
<s> rooms were spotlessly clean. </s>
<s> even smelled good. </s>
<s> soaps ; robes ; etc. </s>
<s> of large closets. </s>
<s> bathrooms were older but well maintained. </s>
<s> better than the ones at the Four Seasons. </s>
<s> furniture was nice but worn in some spots. </s>

<s> service was fast. </s>
<s> food and service were great. </s>
<s> pool and workout areas were clean and well maintained. </s>
<s> had one small problem with a burned out lightbulb in one of the lamps. </s>
<s> arrived quickly with a new bulb. </s>
<s> would n't allow me to tip them ! Check-in was somewhat slow as the hotel has been sold out for several weeks. </s>
<s> is a very large hotel ; so they have to move a lot of people and rooms. </s>
<s> ; the hotel does not have views as it is configured like an " E " . </s>
<s> in all ; the Palmer House is a good value for the money. </s>
<s> am often traveling on business and I always try to stay at the James. </s>
<s> modern design of the lobby and restaurant with wood and glass creates a luxurious atmosphere and the streamlined ; comfortable room design give an upscale aesthetic like that of a penthouse loft apartment. </s>
<s> availability of computers and coffee in the James business centers means I do not have to lug my laptop around the hotel. </s>
<s> James provides the perfect setting for business travelers and is a cozy place to retire to in the evenings. </s>
<s> ease of breakfast service in the rooms means that I do not have to stress or rush ; as my time is valuable. </s>
<s> love the James. </s>
<s> Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is one of the worse hotels I have stayed in. </s>
<s> from the lobby to the staff to the room experience was horrible. </s>
<s> I walked in to the lobby ; the lobby had a fowl smell ; similar to rotten eggs. </s>
<s> staff was n't much better ; especially room service ; where it took over 30 minutes just to make my request for more towels. </s>
<s> baggage handlers gave me rude service and when checking in or out ; they almost just refuse to provide service. </s>
<s> room I stayed in was ill maintained and looked like nothing like in the pictures. </s>
<s> windows were dirty and I could n't see anything outside the window. </s>
<s> room smelled like someone soiled the room and there were ants crawling on the tabletops. </s>
<s> I had to give any suggestion on this hotel ; you should just avoid this hotel all together. </s>
<s> a cheap motel has better standards than this hotel. </s>
<s> husband and I satayed for two nights at the Hilton Chicago ; and enjoyed every minute of it ! The bedrooms are immaculate ; and the linnens are very soft. </s>
<s> also appreciated the free wifi ; as we could stay in touch with friends while staying in Chicago. </s>
<s> bathroom was quite spacious ; and I loved the smell of the shampoo they provided-not like most hotel shampoos. </s>
<s> service was amazing ; and we absolutely loved the beautiful indoor pool. </s>
<s> would recommend staying here to anyone. </s>
<s> was my first time in Chicago and I tell you they really made me feel like a million bucks. </s>
<s> took a taxi straight from the airport and was greeted at the door by a kind gentlemen who offered to help me with my luggage and assisted me to the check-in counter. </s>
<s> made my way up to my room ; which was spectacularly bright and well-lit ; then I ordered some food. </s>
<s> in all the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic. </s>
<s> I did n't have such a short stay in Chicago I would have stayed in my hotel room all day ! Overall ; the hotel is beautiful. </s>
<s> service was great. </s>
<s> the employees were friendly and always willing to help. </s>
<s> room on the North end had a great view of the city and the Chicago River. </s>
<s> bed and big fluffy pillows were very comfortable and relaxing. </s>
<s> only downfalls were parking and the fitness room. </s>
<s> was a little on the pricey side and not exactly as close to the hotel as one would think it should be. </s>
<s> hotel itself is huge with over 1500 rooms ; so you may feel like your getting your daily exercise in just walking from your room to the fitness center depending on where your room is located. </s>
<s> is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of US cities. </s>
<s> entrance and lobby of the hotel indicates its class. </s>
<s> bedrooms are large and comfortable and the customer service is second to none. </s>
<s> is located on South Michigan directly across the road from Grant and Millenium Park. </s>
<s> also has a free shuttle to the Water Tower in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. </s>
<s> Blues fans ; Buddy Guy 's Legends Club is situated immediately behind the Hotel. </s>
<s> recommended. </s>
<s> was visiting Chicago for a christening with my fiance. </s>
<s> was impressed with this hotel from the moment I checked in. </s>
<s> lobby was exceptionally modern with color and furnishings. </s>
<s> desk staff was pleasant and helpful ; especially Susan ; who quickly suggested and reserved a table for us at Keefer 's Steakhouse for a late dinner. </s>
<s> room itself was fabulous. </s>
<s> comfortable King sized bed ; dual head shower ; breathtakingly beautiful views of the city ; I could n't ask for more. </s>
<s> a great nights sleep we awoke to a great FREE breakfast right outside our room ! Next we enjoyed a couple 's massage and I was treated to a facial as my fiance took a short run through the city. </s>
<s> a day full of shopping we retired to our room and ordered room service that was on time and delicious. </s>
<s> we checked out the next day ; because I could have stayed there forever. </s>
<s> fully recommend the Amalfi Hotel Chicago for everyone interested in a superior stay. </s>
<s> is truly a beautiful and well appointed hotel. </s>
<s> James Chicago Hotel is located right in the heart of the one and only ; downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> wonderful hotel has many classy and down to earth boutique 's ; and the views are breath-taking. </s>
<s> hotel just has a warm feeling to it ; and the hotel staff is more than excellent. </s>
<s> hotel is situated right across from the Magnificent Mile ; and only minutes away from the world famous shopping ; dining ; and fun for all ages. </s>
<s> James is modern and luxurious. </s>
<s> James is definately a hotel that I would recommend and will go back to in years to come. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency Hotel in Chicago was the worst hotel I ever went to ! I booked a non-smoking room online ; and they went ahead and gave me a room that smoking was allowed. </s>
<s> going in my room ; I smelled heavy smoke smell. </s>
<s> was really bad. </s>
<s> called the front desk about the issue ; and they said they had nothing like that on record and refused to exchange rooms for me ! There was also blood stains on my bed sheets. </s>
<s> carpet was also dirty. </s>
<s> would never book at that Hyatt again ! James Chicago - After an exhausting flight ; the James did little to make me feel recharged. </s>
<s> service took over 30 minutes to deliver my steak ; only to discover that it was overcooked ! While they look quite elegant ; I found that their walls are essentially paper-thin as I awoke multiple times to noise emanating from other rooms. </s>
<s> the morning the room continued to disappoint : the shower head was clearly mounted too low-down ; making it a pain to get decently clean. </s>
<s> Hotel - I visited Chicago during the winter. </s>
<s> stayed at Amalfi Hotel which was a terrible mistake. </s>
<s> I entered the hotel ; the staff told me that my room had been upgraded. </s>
<s> my expectations got higher but when I entered the room ; it was very dirty. </s>
<s> were cigarette burn marks everywhere. </s>
<s> ; there was a used towel in the bathroom. </s>
<s> complained to the staff about these issues ; they were not responsive. </s>
<s> room was near the valley. </s>
<s> were a lot of homeless people fighting during the night ; thus I could not sleep properly. </s>
<s> will never stay in this hotel again. </s>
<s> the moment I walked in I was impressed. </s>
<s> staff was very courteous and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was welcoming. </s>
<s> hotel was spacious and glamorous without looking overindulgent. </s>
<s> room was very nice and comfortable with a beautiful view and all everything I would need was in my kitchen. </s>
<s> found the pool and gym to be fantastic and I could truly relax during my stay. </s>
<s> will definitely book another stay at this hotel. </s>
<s> this on priceline for an insanely low price of $ 65 a night. </s>
<s> BF and I were amazed when we got there -- the person checking us in was friendly and helpful to suggest some local nightspots and the room was gorgeous ! A nice upscale ; downtown feel and super comfy beds. </s>
<s> had a fabulous view from the 25th floor that inlcluded a sliver of Lake Michigan ; a sliver of the Taste of Chicago crowds ; and some friendly office workers in the builiding next door who waved to us a few times. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> had a pretty anonymous experience the rest of our stay -- which was fine with us. </s>
<s> hotel consists mainly of 2 towers and is like a huge ; sprawling city inside. </s>
<s> we were n't there to stay in the hotel room the entire time . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> we like to get out and explore as much as possible. </s>
<s> location was fantastic. </s>
<s> walking distance to Michigan Avenue and the rest of downtown. </s>
<s> walked for blocks well into the night and never felt like we needed a cab. </s>
<s> also highly recommend the Urban Cruise on the river ' the entrance is right across from the hotel -- we saw some amazing architecture from the boat and got to cruise Lake Michigan a bit too. </s>
<s> n't park your car here if you do n't need to -- it 's very expensive. </s>
<s> downtown or ditch the rental car -- you wo n't need it anyway ; you can walk to tons of stuff or grab a cab. </s>
<s> Chicago and totally recommend this hotel ! Fairmont Chicago Millenium Park - I stayed at this hotel over my holiday vacation while I was visiting a close friend of mine. </s>
<s> room that I stayed in was the average size ; with a king bed ; desk and a couch. </s>
<s> room 's furnitures could have been arranged better ; but the room was surely large enough for me to do my work. </s>
<s> husband and I had a wonderful time at Swissotel Chicago ; when my husband went for a trade fair. </s>
<s> got a classic double room for two nights and it was definitely worth the money. </s>
<s> and comfortable ; chic and new fixtures. </s>
<s> view of the pier was magnificent. </s>
<s> were most helpful and prompt when we requested extra towels and pillow. </s>
<s> 's right next to riverside restaurants and river is very pretty. </s>
<s> for 3 nights. </s>
<s> via hotwire ; upgraded to historic tower. </s>
<s> a big room ; with a nice view. </s>
<s> was great. </s>
<s> parking was efficient ; but you expect it for 53 doller 'night. </s>
<s> the location was the best We stayed at this Hotel in February 2010. </s>
<s> room was great we had purchased it at a raffel at work for a fund raiser for United Way. </s>
<s> we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity. </s>
<s> were woke up at 3 : 00am in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor. </s>
<s> course one of the rooms they rented was right next to ours. </s>
<s> were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on. </s>
<s> called the front desk who sent security up immediately. </s>
<s> tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave. </s>
<s> called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down. </s>
<s> of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted. </s>
<s> we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate. </s>
<s> we still paid for it !. </s>
<s> would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had. </s>
<s> would never stay at this hotel again ; obviously they really do n't care about their guests. </s>
<s> Amalfi Hotel Chicago is perfect for a romantic get-away. </s>
<s> husband and I spent a weekend away from the kids there and I must say ; we were impressed by the staff and the accomodations. </s>
<s> especially enjoyed the in-room spa service. </s>
<s> recommend the Amalfi to anyone wanting a nice hotel in the downtown Chicago area ' you are within walking distance of shopping with great customer service and luxury accomodations ! I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently for a convention I was attending. </s>
<s> was my first trip to Chicago and I had no idea what to expect and this hotel came recommended by a colleague so I had high expectations. </s>
<s> took a bit longer than I would have liked as they were experiencing computer problems and the staff at the front desk had to call their main reservation line to confirm reservations. </s>
<s> I did get into my room ; there was a strong cigarette odor in spite of the fact that it was a non-smoking room. </s>
<s> went down to the front desk and requested a room change. </s>
<s> their computer problems ; that took almost an hour and the staff was quite surly and did n't have the " positive attitude in spite of any difficulty " I 'd expect from such a high profile establishment. </s>
<s> new room was not a suite as I had originally booked but it was significantly fresher smelling. </s>
<s> I hooked up my laptop ; I was dismayed to discover that there was no wi-fi service. </s>
<s> had made my reservation online to take advantage of their free wi-fi for online ressies ; but as part of their computer problems ; the wi-fi service was down. </s>
<s> ; there was a Starbucks up the street with available wi-fi. </s>
<s> ; I could n't lounge at the Starbucks in my jammies like I could in my hotel room ; but connectivity for work is necessary so we make sacrifices. </s>
<s> was determined not to let computer problems color my opinion of the hotel as it 's not something that is necessarily under the control of local management. </s>
<s> ; the hair in the bathroom sink and the wet washcloth that was on the floor behind the toilet are definitely under the control of local management. </s>
<s> quick call to housekeeping got a promise to give the room a once over while I was down the street at Starbucks. </s>
<s> did as promised and when I arrived back at the room there were no stray bits of previous customer 's DNA and the dust bunny population had been eradicated. </s>
<s> I had a chance to relax in the room ; there were a few minor details that stood out. </s>
<s> carpet was starting to get worn in places ; the edges on some of the furniture was dinged ; and my personal pet peeve . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  the inside of the drawers were rough ; unfinished wood which I dislike as the little splinters can cause runs in my clothes. </s>
<s> would have expected higher quality furniture for such a hotel. </s>
<s> ; all things considered ; my stay was tolerable. </s>
<s> pressure was good and it was quiet enough at night to get decent sleep. </s>
<s> wi-fi was still down in the morning so I checked out early and spent my time enjoying a latte and free wi-fi at Starbucks. </s>
<s> would not reccomend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago if you want a good deal and a good nights sleep. </s>
<s> stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago for two nights this past July. </s>
<s> had a select king city view room. </s>
<s> room was dark ; with ugly black carpets and the view was of another building right next door - not a great view. </s>
<s> was on an upper level floor and the elevators were incredibly slow. </s>
<s> hotel was pretty loud and the people in the room next to mine were up partying all night long ; so it was very hard to get to sleep on my first night there. </s>
<s> I called to complain at the front desk they promised to do something about it but never did. </s>
<s> ended up having to call two more times before the management did something about the room next door. </s>
<s> quieted down for about an hour ; but then were loud again for the rest of the night. </s>
<s> hotel was expensive ; and for the price there were n't very many special amenities. </s>
<s> was no continental breakfast and the wifi was not included -- you had to sign up for a day of service at $ 10 a day. </s>
<s> I would not recommend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago ; as it is way overpriced for what you get. </s>
<s> this hotel the first time I was in Chicago. </s>
<s> the prices and for being classified an intercontinental . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> I would n't consider it that good. </s>
<s> rooms were solid. </s>
<s> view was ok ' but so is it virtually everywhere else on Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> '
The service was ok. </s>
<s> prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else. </s>
<s> came here for a Jewish 'Hindi wedding. </s>
<s> was fine. </s>
<s> entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else. </s>
<s> was inedible. </s>
<s> have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it. </s>
<s> personally preferred the Conrad. </s>
<s> prices and better service. </s>
<s> reviews we read were a bit mixed ; but I thought it was excellent. </s>
<s> 've stayed in The Splendido ; Villa D 'Este and others and it does n't compare ; but nor should it. </s>
<s> does n't claim to be in that space. </s>
<s> expected it to be a notch off the Four Seasons and so it proved. </s>
<s> only a small notch too !. </s>
<s> clean and bright room. </s>
<s> views ; very quiet ; comfy bed etc. </s>
<s> service all round and nice staff. </s>

<s> our return ; nothing had been moved in the room to re-clean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so I can only assume ; it was n't even checked as promised. </s>

<s> were promptly delivered but room service took 40 minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice ! The curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming ; the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it ; the honor bar 'fridge was gouged and dirty ; too ! The mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on - not neat and tidy at all . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> There were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well. </s>

<s> but given the price of parking ; taxes ; and etc. </s>
<s> at this point I would n't recommend this Hyatt to anyone. </s>
<s> husband travels and uses his Hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4-star hotel. </s>
<s> felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility. </s>
<s> first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews. </s>
<s> some reason ; I kept being disappointed at every turn. </s>
<s> room on the 4th floor. </s>
<s> not get the room to cool down - it was stifling. </s>
<s> WARNED - No water ; no mini-bar no vending machine ; no nothing once you get in your room. </s>
<s> might as well be in prison. </s>
<s> have coffee in the morning ; but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days. </s>
<s> guess that is convenient for them ; but what about me ? Workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest. </s>
<s> only treadmill I could get on was broken. </s>
<s> what a cooler with water in it ! Oh no - it was only stocked for one day. </s>
<s> that nothing. </s>
<s> to set expectations and then fail to deliver. </s>
<s> with towels - one day they have them - next day they don 't. </s>
<s> essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $ 10 charge for wireless ' go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free. </s>
<s> should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach. </s>
<s> have stayed at much better for less. </s>
<s> n't be coming back. </s>
<s> a tattered run down facility that you should avoid . </s>
<s> are small ; dirty ; and in no way represents the web sites representations. </s>
<s> is poorly trained and a very big disappointment. </s>
<s> best it is a 3 star facility ands with so many options in Chicago ; " please " avoid this one. </s>
<s> had no choice to stay here as a client booked the rooms. </s>
<s> allowed parties to go on all night and booked us in a room with no running water. </s>
<s> called security twice for them to do nothing about the party. </s>
<s> they finally came up about 30 people filed out of that room only to file right back in after about 10 minutes. </s>
<s> we called back nothing was done about it. </s>
<s> 2 year old son was awaken by all the loud music and cursing. </s>
<s> we get up the next morning at 7 : 30 to get ready only to find that we have no running water. </s>
<s> the maintenance man piddles around with it for a half hour we have no time to shower and have to ride the two hour train ride dirty and tired from no sleep. </s>
<s> did not resolve this issue. </s>
<s> just keep passing my complaint to " managers " supposedly. </s>
<s> was the worst stay of my life and my poor two year old had to be there for it After reading the Trip Advisor reviews ; I was expecting an exceptional stay. </s>
<s> was not impressed overall. </s>
<s> concierge ; the view ; and the hotel resturant were the highlights. </s>
<s> bed ; although not horrible ; was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home ; and I do not consider myself and extremely fussy person. </s>
<s> was traveling for business ; and although not dressed in formalwear ; was also not dressed down ; but all in all ; it felt a bit pretentious to me. </s>

<s> Hotel Chicago - Amalfi Hotel Chicago ; We traveled to Chicago last spring and stayed at Amalfi Hotel for three days. </s>
<s> will never come back to this hotel. </s>
<s> selected this hotel because we found many positive online feedbacks about it. </s>
<s> we had a very bad experience. </s>
<s> is one of the worst hotels I have ever been to. </s>
<s> bathroom of our room was too old and the sink was leaking causing the bathroom floor to be wet all the time ! We reported the problem to room service and they were very apologetic but they refused to change the room because there is no vacant room available. </s>
<s> ; the water pressure of the shower was too weak making it long to get a quick bath. </s>
<s> food was not so tasty and we had to wait 45 minutes to get our order. </s>
<s> seems that the staff are not organized and the management is ignorant. </s>
<s> waste your money at Amalfi Hotel. </s>
<s> husband and I recently stayed stayed at the Hilton Chicago and it was a horrible experience. </s>
<s> we arrived ; the front desk clerk was on the phone on what sounded like a personal call and did n't even acknowledge us for at least five minutes. </s>
<s> we got to our room I went to lay on the bed and noticed a black hair on the pillow. </s>
<s> 'm am very paranoid about hotels being dirty ; so I pulled back the sheets and moved all the pillows around and noticed several more hairs. </s>
<s> called for some new sheets which they said they would send right up but it actually took nearly 30 minutes. </s>
<s> second night we were there we decided to try the Irish pub in the hotel called Kitty O 'Sheas because my husband loves pub food. </s>
<s> had the shepherd 's pie which was awful. </s>
<s> was watery and had no flavor and it was not cheap ! Our server seemed annoyed when we complained and did not offer it to be taken off the check. </s>
<s> we had a great trip to Chicago ; the Hilton was definitely NOT a highlight of our trip. </s>
<s> ; we had rude service ; a dirty room and bad food. </s>
<s> your money elsewhere I walked into this beautiful hotel and knew that I would have a wonderful stay in Chicago. </s>
<s> walking around the city all day ; I was always excited to relax in this cleanly and superbly comforting place. </s>
<s> service was friendly and I especially liked the location. </s>
<s> a Treat ! Sofitel Chicago Water Tower ; " I went to Chicago last month for a conference and enjoyed my staying at Sofitel. </s>
<s> first I booked there simply because the location was really close to where the meeting was held ; but later on I was impressed by more than great location. </s>
<s> room was so spacious that I was able to do some abs workout the night before the conference to refresh myself a little bit. </s>
<s> room was also very quiet ; which made me sleep really well. </s>
<s> was excellent ; especially their omelets. </s>
<s> service was also pretty good. </s>
<s> was a very helpful concierge girl who directed me and my friends to a really nice bar ' forgot the name the night before we left. </s>
<s> the conference was not that exciting ; discovering Sofitel Water Tower made me feel good about the trip because I would 't have a hard time making decisions next time I visit Chicago. </s>
<s> worth the money. </s>
<s> " 
I did stay in this hotel couple of days back and was a bit disappointed with it. </s>
<s> hotel did not quiet live up to the expectation I was indeed expecting. </s>
<s> rooms were dull and cramped with very small bed. </s>
<s> parking lot was small for a hotel of this size. </s>
<s> the staff was not very welcoming. </s>
<s> faced problems with the room as it was a bit noisy and also due to the fact that the elevators were close to my room. </s>
<s> dining hall was packed and had to wait in the lounge for quiet sometime. </s>
<s> refrigerator made loud and clunky noise which was fixed later. </s>
<s> beer and wine were served rather than the one that I asked for. </s>
<s> the location was good and housekeeping did a good job. </s>
<s> I would prefer staying at another hotel for the same expense. </s>
<s> Hard Rock should stick to restaurants. </s>
<s> a recent stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago I think they should go back to what there good at. </s>
<s> having to wait an hour for my room to be ready ' this is after my check in time ; the receptionist was very rude and seemed to not care that I was being delayed. </s>
<s> seeing the state the room was in I still do not understand what took so long. </s>
<s> sheets look to have been picked up off the floor and returned to the bed. </s>
<s> bathroom looked as if somebody had just used it ' I will leave out the details. </s>
<s> did n't seem to get me anywhere ; they offered me a small discount at the hotel 's bar. </s>
<s> this experience I will be more likely to book at a Motel 6 then return to the Hard Rock. </s>
<s> Chicago Water Tower ; " I went to Chicago last month for a conference and booked Sofitel Water Tower because it was close to the conference location. </s>
<s> my trip ; I kind of regretted of this decision I made. </s>
<s> was nothing too special about this hotel except location ; and the location was really not worth $ 300 per night. </s>
<s> of my friends were staying in hotels a little bit far away but much cheaper ; and it was really convenient to take the cabs. </s>
<s> pretty much stayed in the conference for the whole day ; and all I did in the hotel was sleeping. </s>
<s> I was not even able to enjoy the only thing I did there. </s>
<s> room was cold and VERY humid ; and the bathroom smelled disgusting. </s>
<s> bed was not comfortable too ; which woke me up twice in one night. </s>
<s> not worth the money I spent. </s>
<s> " 
My friend and I stayed for just one night ; and loved the hotel. </s>
<s> had an awesome water feature in the hotel ; and great large bar. </s>
<s> all Hyatts it had a very comfortable bed ; lot 's of pillows ; and large bathroom. </s>
<s> arriving to the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago ; I was immediately impressed. </s>
<s> staff was friendly and checked us in quickly ; which is important to me after a long trip. </s>
<s> room was immaculate and decorated in a clean modern style. </s>
<s> bed was very comfortable ; including the linens which felt high quality ; unlike what you get at some other hotels. </s>
<s> this made for a great night sleep. </s>
<s> the most impressive part of our stay at the Hard Rock Hotel was their " Party like a Rottweiler " package we added to our reservation. </s>
<s> an additional fee we were able to bring our pet and were provided with treats ; toys and best of all the pet cam ! We left our dog in the room with a pet cam and were able to watch him throughout the day on my iPhone ! All in all this was a great place to stay and I 'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to travel with their pet. </s>
<s> stay at the Hilton Chicago definetely felt like a vacation. </s>
<s> in that big wonderful bed felt like I was at home ! The accommodations and hotel are beautiful. </s>
<s> especially enjoyed the gym. </s>
<s> staff was friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> would reccommend this Hotel to anyone who is looking for a home away from home. </s>
<s> Affinia hotel in Chicago was superb. </s>
<s> room service was exemplary and the food ; I do n't even know were to start. </s>
<s> chef obviously knew what he was doing ; I especially loved the seafood ; my personal favorite was the shrimp. </s>
<s> from this ; I loved how beautiful the hotel was. </s>
<s> is definetly a bargain for the price ; for that price you would probably get a good 3 star hotel but ; I felt as if i was in a $ 10 ; 000 a night 5 star hotel in the Europe. </s>
<s> bang for your buck. </s>
<s> recommend it to anybody looking to relax at a great hotel with great amenities in a great city. </s>
<s> friends actually went their a while back because of me. </s>
<s> loved it ! I know you will too. </s>
<s> stayed here with a dozen of my friends ; and more than half of us got eaten alive by bed bugs ! We stayed there from September 28 - September 30th ; but the symptoms ' i. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the crazy itchiness did n't come until Sunday night when we all got home. </s>
<s> complained to the hotel and basically all they 're gonna do is cover the cost of our dry cleaning bills. </s>
<s> ; they should reimburse us ; because it was not worth it at all. </s>
<s> NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL ! I stayed at the Hilton Chicago last week and was very disappointed. </s>
<s> highlight of the stay was waiting 20 minutes for a bellman to come and get our luggage. </s>
<s> ; my 72 year old mother ; 8 year old son ; and myself gave up and dragged it all down to valet parking ourselves - no easy task. </s>
<s> security guard was kind enough to hold the door for me. </s>
<s> valet parking attendants looked over and then ignored us. </s>
<s> far as I could tell ; he was just standing there doing nothing. </s>
<s> could n't let go of the bags without everything falling so I gave my son the parking receipt. </s>
<s> attendant pointed to where our car was parked - no short distance away. </s>
<s> 8 year old had to tell him to pull it up. </s>
<s> should have been ashamed. </s>
<s> significant ; but irritating issues. </s>
<s> pool is part of the Hilton Athletic club. </s>
<s> lanes are reserved for adults wanting to lap swim. </s>
<s> ; two adults can take up 2 '3rds of the pool while everyone else is consigned to the leftover 1 '3rd. </s>
<s> is ridiculous and very family unfriendly. </s>
<s> addition ; the pool closes at 9 p. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> pool closes at 9 ? We stayed for 3 nights. </s>
<s> one single additional bar of soap ; bottle of shampoo ; or coffee stirrers. </s>
<s> Regency Chicago seemed like a nice place to stay ; but we did n't like it very much. </s>
<s> renovations were cheap and poorly done ' our bathroom faucet was leaky and the carpet had bumps in it. </s>
<s> '
The staff was RUDE ! I was trying to find a good cab service ; and the guy behind the front desk made me wait for 20 minutes while he was finishing a phone call ! Could n't he have at least called someone else to help me ? The " Babies Travel Lite " gave us the wrong sized diapers ; so we had to go find some anyway ; and with the hotel being located in the heart of the city that meant we found some unsavory characters along the way. </s>
<s> 've been here for 4 days. </s>
<s> location right off of miracle mile ; near all major hotels ; best shopping and theatres. </s>
<s> very large. </s>
<s> staff very friendly and helpful ; and respond immediately. </s>
<s> : there frequently are homeless people ' even during daylight on Superior between St. </s>
<s> Clair and Michigan Avenue ' the main route you walk for or all activities ; and just about everything is in walking distance from here. </s>
<s> night ; the street on the north side of Superior is dark ; and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors. </s>
<s> street people do not approach you ; although they may stare as you go by. </s>
<s> 2 or more along the way ; where they sleep on the window sills of Neiman Marcus. </s>
<s> would not think a woman would feel safe by herself. </s>
<s> I am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia. </s>
<s> '
There are homeless up and down Michigan Street ; but this is different as it 's a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street. </s>
<s> entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work ; and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation. </s>
<s> now ; expect two extremely small ; warm ; slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm ; cramped hallways ! All the walls throughout the hotel need painting ; and the wallpaper is peeling in places. </s>
<s> the room ; several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection ; the carpets were stained ; the bathrooms needed new grout ' some mold visible ; the TV is very small ' 16 Inch ? and the windows very ; very dirty. </s>
<s> wo n't get your room serviced unless you ask for it ; sometimes more than once. </s>
<s> " pub " downstairs is run down ; dark and kind of creepy. </s>
<s> and room service are very expensive ; as is parking $ 34 'day public and $ 38 'day valet. </s>
<s> the plus side ; the bed was very comfortable ; there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area ; plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans St. </s>
<s> Clair street toward the north and south. </s>
<s> can see a sliver of Lake Michigan. </s>
<s> small ; but clean. </s>
<s> in all ; it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room ; but I think it is overpriced ; and I would not stay here again. </s>
<s> stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights for a friends reunion. </s>
<s> room was clean and new feeling ; nice city view ; free bottled water in room upon arrival. </s>
<s> in was a breeze ; and our room was ready even though we were several hours early. </s>
<s> staff was friendly and helpful ; excellent breakfast. </s>
<s> overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel. </s>
<s> " amenities " were a smoke screen ; nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn. </s>
<s> would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase. </s>
<s> charged $ 15 'day for Internet on top of a $ 250 'night rate was a bit over the top. </s>
<s> bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient. </s>
<s> shower was a nice size with a fantastic over-sized shower head ; unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost. </s>
<s> staff were friendly and helpful ; actually the best part of the stay were the staff. </s>
<s> in all I found it overpriced for the quality of the room. </s>
<s> Chicago Water Tower I stayed at Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for a weekend last September. </s>
<s> ; I had a several bad experiences with this hotel. </s>
<s> arrived just one hour earlier than the check-in time ; but I was not allowed to check in ; so I had to leave my luggage at the reception area and walk around on the street to pass the time. </s>
<s> ; the weather was good so I enjoyed my walk. </s>
<s> room was cleaned nicely ; but I was on the third floor so I did n't have any view of the city. </s>
<s> was free internet access ; but the speed was extremely slow and made it almost impossible for me to work and communicate online. </s>
<s> tried several times and finally gave up. </s>
<s> bathroom was certainly large ; but I did not enjoy the shower due to the low water pressure coming out of the shower head. </s>
<s> part that I was most frustrated by was the cleaning lady who came early in the morning around 8am ' despite my DO NOT DISTURB sign ; and I was woken up by her knocking on the door. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel to others. </s>
<s> Omni Chicago- My husband and I stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a long weekend last April. </s>
<s> was the best weekend I 've had in a long time ! From the fancy dining room ; the excellent guest service ; to the relaxing pool we had everything we could have wished for to make our stay a memorable stay. </s>
<s> we got to our suite the room had everything we needed : Lavender soap ; shampoo ; conditioner ; a hair drier ; even an ironing board ; Wi-Fi and a flat screen TV. </s>
<s> was nothing missing ! Our dinner was also amazing. </s>
<s> only did they have a vegetarian meal ; but they also replaced the potatoes with carrots and peas 'of course free of charge ! The fitness room was also amazing ; they had several treadmills and a warm pool. </s>
<s> we went to the pool after dinner we were the only people there so we were able to enjoy the peace and quiet. </s>
<s> we went back to our rooms we enjoyed a long walk along Michigan Avenue ; passing by the shops ; park and the art museum. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a wonderful stay in Chicago ! A recent stay at the James Hotel-Chicago ; revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only. </s>
<s> the rooms and public areas look nice ; the hotel still needs serious work. </s>
<s> first room was not clean when we arrived and this non-smoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke. </s>
<s> asked for a new room which was clean and odor free. </s>
<s> had to involve the Manager before our request was granted. </s>
<s> new room was better at first glance ; but was severely lacking. </s>
<s> could not get the temperature properly regulated. </s>
<s> room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay. </s>
<s> a hotel commanding the rates of the James ; we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted ; not something which is a constant battle. </s>
<s> mattress was horribly uncomfortable. </s>
<s> the rooms were updated ; the James skipped new mattresses. </s>
<s> was worn to the point of having indentations you ca n't get out of -- when you lie down ; you sort of sink into a hole. </s>
<s> matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a ' luxury hotel. </s>
<s> ; but not least ; we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay. </s>
<s> spite of the calming decor ; the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good night 's sleep. </s>
<s> in all ; we were unhappy with our accommodations at the James Chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location. </s>
<s> will be happier almost anywhere else. </s>
<s> rave about their beds but the beds were average. </s>
<s> surface room seemed clean ; however ; dropped my pen behind nightstand and discovered at least an inch of dust. </s>
<s> appeared there had been repairs to something where they had to cut away part of the wall. </s>
<s> repair job was covered up with a wallpaper board over the hole but the board did not even completely cover hole. </s>
<s> to have a decent shower or bath. </s>
<s> water saving devices on both the shower and tub provided basically a trickle of water. </s>
<s> was unable to get the shampoo out of my hair as pressure was so poor. </s>
<s> be prepared to be nickled and dimed to death. </s>
<s> was even a $ 10 charge if you used the coffeemaker in the room ; really ! For room service they tack on a delivery charge and a 20 % gratuity. </s>
<s> the waiter does not stay to serve you how is he earning a gratuity. </s>
<s> have already been charged for him to deliver the food. </s>
<s> parking fees were outrageous at $ 51 a night but to add insult they charge a hotel patron the same fees as the general public. </s>
<s> packing to leave we realized that the dvd set my son had brought was missing. </s>
<s> reported the theft to the hotel. </s>
<s> to file a report with security who promised me they would investigate and get back to me within 2 days. </s>
<s> has now been over two weeks. </s>
<s> follow up ; no apology even given. </s>
<s> will never stay at this hotel again. </s>
<s> have been to Chicago many times and this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed at. </s>
<s> just got back from 3 nights at the Sofitel. </s>
<s> really have nothing bad or negative to say about it. </s>
<s> 've stayed at other higher end hotels in Chicago such as the Park Hyatt ; The Peninsula ; and The Four Seasons - and the Sofitel tops them all. </s>
<s> 's a 4 star hotel with 3 star prices. </s>
<s> 's a beautiful hotel all the way around. </s>
<s> is uniformly friendly without being patronizing. </s>
<s> were helpful with the one small problem we had and solved it quickly. </s>
<s> common areas are fresh and modern in appearance. </s>
<s> room was very clean with comfortable beds and well-appointed marble-accented baths. </s>
<s> wife loved the huge tub. </s>
<s> had breakfast via roomservice every morning and it was always hot and delicious. </s>
<s> robes and Evian at turndown was always appreciated. </s>
<s> property is ideally situated in the middle of the Gold Coast and all the best shopping and eating is within a short walk. </s>
<s> a Bentley or latte ? They 're all close by. </s>
<s> was our second stay since it opened and I 'm sure it 's to be our home away from home when we are in Chicago. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> best hotel ever ! i 've stayed at various hotels in the area and the service has been really suckish. </s>
<s> at one hotel i stayed at they had a molded sandwhich under the bed ; how gross and i could of really got sick ! but this hotel was the perfect location right by the beach and by all the clubs . </s>
<s> ohh . </s>
<s> and the pump room ; the best food i 've evr had at a hotel . </s>
<s> evan got to take a picture with Queen Anne ! i will never regret coming to this hotel ! i loved this hotel so much me and my bridemaid 's stayed here . </s>
<s> and it 's just walking distance from all the popular food places and clubs . </s>
<s>  all the places to be at least When you 're paying over $ 350 'night for a hotel ; you 'd expect a world-class experience and amenities. </s>
<s> ; I got no such thing during my stay. </s>
<s> ; they have tons of space and features like a ballroom ; gym ; and bars ; as well as a great location within walking distance of the Navy Pier. </s>
<s> the pros end there. </s>
<s> was honestly disappointed with our standard-sized room ; which definitely made you feel like a second-class citizen compared to the club level guests. </s>
<s> was a shower but no bathtub ; the room was on the small side ; and I did n't even get a lake-facing room. </s>
<s> I opened the pre-stock fridge I was disgusted to see nothing but expired fruit inside. </s>
<s> mean ; do they even inspect the rooms at all ? Worst of all ; however ; was an air vent near the bed that constantly let in unwanted noise at night. </s>
<s> tried to contact the hotel manager about it ; but all he offered were points in their loyalty program. </s>
<s> useless ! Outside the room there were problems as well. </s>
<s> ; there 's a pool ; but the water was absolutely freezing ; and to make matters worse ; I was unable to find a towel for over an hour ; and so here I was freezing my butt off waiting to dry off. </s>
<s> gym was ok ; but was very small and dirty looking with way too many treadmills and not enough weights. </s>
<s> 'd much rather go for a run outside by the beautiful lake ; admittingly one of the finer points of Chicago. </s>
<s> not go to this hotel simply because of the pretty interior you see in brochures and their website. </s>
<s> will regret it. </s>

<s> called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as Ambassador Club. </s>
<s> I arrived at the hotel ; there was no separate check-in line ' as advertised and the manager on duty basically ignored me when I told him I was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room. </s>
<s> was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty. </s>
<s> gave me a room in the " modern " tower ; ' built in the 60 's which was about 2 '3 the size of a regular room at the Mark Hopkins ' built in ' 29. </s>
<s> had to deal with torn sheets ; cracked marble sinks ; and the spare roll of toilet paper being located OUTSIDE the bathroom inside the closet - how convenient is that ? The closet door ; if you are not careful ; may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door. </s>
<s> was not provided with a key to the minibar and I called for turndown service ; which never happened. </s>

<s> I was only staying one night ; I decided not to ask for a different room- although I do n't know if asking for a different room would 've made any difference considering the lack of hospitality from the reception desk. </s>

<s> Chicage Hotel - A friend and I stayed at the hotel over a weekend. </s>

<s> ; the Hilton was proof. </s>
<s> called downstairs and complained ; and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. </s>
<s> ; I found the room disgusting. </s>

<s> top of it the hotel is doing construction of there own. </s>
<s> front of the hotel is block and lucky for us the protestors that are standing in front of the hotel were able to tell use where the new entrance was. </s>

<s> you insist on trying it for yourself do n't pay for your room in advance they will not let you out of the room and then you are stuck. </s>

<s> Talbott Hotel is a place to stay where the staff treat you like you are not welcome. </s>

<s> hotel is located in a neighborhood ; so it felt like we were staying in a condo or a home rather than a hotel. </s>
<s> is very little noise ; however ; you are only about 2 blocks from Rush and Division streets ; with all the nightlife ; and the Red Line at Clark and Division is only 3 blocks away. </s>

<s> will definitely NOT be coming back to Hotel Allegro. </s>
<s> time I stayed in this city ; I went to the Holiday Inn which was much better ! The hard rock hotel Chicago is not as good as they try to portray ; First ill start off by saying there website is confusing and hard to navigate through. </s>
<s> also have rude customer service ; that dont seem happy to answer your questions. </s>
<s> prices are so outrageously expensive for what they offer ; its just ridiculous. </s>

<s> carpeting was atrocious and the color of vomit ; the room smelled of smoke ' even though it 's advertised as smoke-free and there were a few long brown hairs in our bed ! I was so grossed out that I had to call down to the rude staff to ask for our linens to be changed and they gave us a huge attitude about it. </s>

<s> room was comfortable and clean and fairly quiet. </s>
<s> could hear the train and some traffic from the street ' considering the location ; this was n't bad and did n't affect my ability to sleep or relax. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend this hotel - a gem ! My stay at the Hyatt Regency was an experience that I 'll never ever forget - not in a good way. </s>
<s> was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant. </s>
<s> went up to my room and looked around ; all seemed ok at first. </s>
<s> was bushed so I flopped on the bed . </s>

<s> called the front desk but they were no help ; the clerk just apologized. </s>
<s> at this point ; I turned on the tv and switched on the air. </s>
<s> put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and I saw something slimy inside of the vent. </s>

<s> went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk. </s>
<s> seemed as though the guy was on something - he kept smiling as he apologized ; no empathy as if he 's used to hearing about the goop in the ac. </s>
<s> offered me a free night but there is no way that I 'd stay at this place again - ever. </s>

<s> arrrival we got a warm welcome and the check in was quick and efficient. </s>
<s> interior of the hotel is spectacular and looks like has been refurbished to reflect the decor as it would have been when it was built. </s>
<s> room we were given was a good size with 1 Queen bed which was particularly comfortable. </s>
<s> hotel is conveniently located with restaurants nearby. </s>
<s> first night we ate at the hotel 's own gourmet restaurant ' The Lockwood which did not disappoint. </s>
<s> breakfasts are also served in this restaurant. </s>
<s> had the buffet both mornings and these were good value for the quality offered. </s>
<s> we found the service in this hotel good and the staff very helpful. </s>
<s> nice touch was that when we checked out of the hotel to go to our next destination the car we had booked to pick us up was a few minutes late arriving. </s>

<s> I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure stays for both quality and value for money. </s>
<s> Conrad Chicago is a Michelin rated hotel ; so I was expecting great service and wonderful accommodations. </s>
<s> ; only one part of that was correct. </s>
<s> rooms are indeed nicely furnished ; but the service was terrible ! The concierge was unable to find my room reservation ' I reserved online and even had the email confirmation and was n't very helpful in getting me a new room. </s>
<s> ordered room service ; and the wait time was so long that the food came up cold. </s>
<s> mean ; I understand that it would take time to get the food prepared and up to my room ; but really ? For the price I paid ; it was definitely not worth it ; and I would never use this hotel again. </s>
<s> wife and I decided to stay at the Amalfi while we visited friends in Chicago ; we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this ' Luxury hotel to any of our friends. </s>
<s> claims that your stay begins with a ' warm greeting ; but we received the exact opposite. </s>
<s> front desk clerk was rude ; sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question ; and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room. </s>
<s> there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog ; who we had to bring at the last minute. </s>
<s> room on the Pet Floor was alright ; nothing spectacular ; and unfortunately had a slight scent of covered-up dog urine. </s>
<s> proceeded to dinner at Keefer 's Restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time. </s>
<s> have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire ; opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant. </s>
<s> next day ; I could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly ; and had to finish some work at our friend 's house. </s>
<s> wife had called for some extra towels and pillows ; which took about half an hour to receive. </s>
<s> also ordered breakfast because Breakfast in Bed WAS her favorite- until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them. </s>
<s> were set to stay for 3 days ; but only managed to stay 2. </s>
<s> will not be staying here again. </s>
<s> place ; great room ; great location. </s>
<s> though there was a big meeting going on ' Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns the only consequence for us was slow elevators. </s>
<s> is amazing ; shops on ground floor a nice throwback. </s>
<s> views from upper floors -- we were on 17 I think -- are worth it. </s>
<s> advice about restaurants etc was excellent. </s>
<s> would return. </s>
<s> Downtown Chicago Hilton was the best combination of all the things we were looking for in a hotel- perfect location for both those of us who like shopping and those of us who prefer tourist attractions. </s>
<s> with a Hilton means the essentials are never a concern- as always ; the room was clean and impeccably neat ; the staff friendly and very capable. </s>
<s> wireless access and big flat screen TV were an added plus too ! Best of all ; it is a pet-friendly hotel ; something that is unusual in bigger city 4-diamond hotels. </s>
<s> ; Chicago Hilton ; for a great stay ! When I called to edit my existing reservation ; I was placed on hold for 30 minutes ! Finally someone came on the phone and said ; " Ill have to transfer you " ; so I was put on hold for another 5 minutes. </s>

<s> have no idea why this is considered a four star hotel. </s>
<s> Omni Chicago 's age shows ; and not in a " great ambiance " way ! The rooms are dingy and just plain worn looking. </s>
<s> say rooms because we had to switch our original room as there was a terrible musty odor ; almost like mildew ; that permeated the first room we were given. </s>
<s> ; it brought tears to my eyes ! The staff seemed rather indifferent to our dilemma ; but finally agreed to switch us to another room. </s>
<s> new one did n't smell ; but was clearly past its prime. </s>
<s> was almost nonexistent. </s>
<s> had to call them back both days of our trip to empty the trash and for towels. </s>
<s> can you forget to leave towels for the guests ? I 'm not one to complain ; but for the kind of money we spent for a weekend here ; we were expecting at least a little luxury and special treatment. </s>

<s> stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel was wonderful ! I had a last minute business trip ; in downtown Chicago ; and this is the first place I looked at. </s>

<s> mean they even have high speed wireless internet ! I would definitely recommend the Omni Chicago Hotel ; if you want a great place to stay near Downtown Chicago ! To whom this may concern ; my name is Jamie Brown ; and i was a recent guest of yours between July 4th through July 10th ; and your staff made my stay so comfortable i almost didnt want to leave. </s>
<s> Kitchen in the room and the complimentary grocery shopping service made me rethink leaving all together and when i didnt feel like cooking the complimentary welcome home dinner with a glass of wine ; helped me clear my mind for all the paper work i had to look forward to. </s>
<s> free wireless internet access both in my room and sitting by the pool helped get all that done and helped me get my laps in as well. </s>

<s> hotel 's accommodations were also great. </s>
<s> bathroom and bed are quite comfortable and also clean. </s>
<s> the downside the internet was not free and the fridge automatically charges you when moving items so I was not able to put my drinks inside but I would still highly recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital. </s>
<s> ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here. </s>
<s> first once coming into the room ; there was a mildewy smell in the air ; which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase. </s>
<s> continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well. </s>
<s> eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all. </s>
<s> make matters even worse ; the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon ; when my wife was back from exploring the city. </s>

<s> ; when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy. </s>
<s> bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty. </s>
<s> internet is available ; but that 's an additional fee. </s>
<s> you kidding ? Even the roach motel offers wireless for free ! Also ; the fitness room was available for only $ 15 per day. </s>
<s> ; I thought the room rate was enough to cover that. </s>
<s> I used the coffee supplies in the room ; they were not replenished. </s>

<s> : Elegant lobby nicely decorated with fresh flowers Location : Located in the Heart of Chicago Disappointments - Stained and worn out carpet in hallway - Room was small - Phone and lightbulb in room were broken - Breakfast was $ 60 for two people ; service was slow and impolite - Hotel rationed soaps and shampoo ; one bar of soap to share and one bottle of shampoo which was not replaced for two days ; I felt like I was staying at a budget hotel. </s>
<s> to cap off my stay the hotel made a billing error which took three months and more effort than it was worth to correct. </s>

<s> checked in with no problems -- and the desk person even asked if I 'd prefer a king or double ' reconfirming my reservation preference. </s>
<s> always take the king when I can ; and the bed was fantastic ! It was suited with great linen and these incredible down feather pillows named Encompass made by The Pillow Factory -- I checked the tags ; since I plan to buy some ! I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant - Aria ; which they mention they like to be considered separate from the hotel -- and YES ; it does stand out all on it 's own. </s>
<s> food is Asian fusion ; and truly wonderful -- as a gourmand and life-long foodie ; I appreciate great food when I taste it ! The hotel service was good as well. </s>
<s> drawback was the breakfast buffet at the restaurant -- seems they need to stick with their dinner theme solely. </s>
<s> missed the mark on relatively simply things like scrambled eggs on the buffet ; which tasted a bit ' metallic. </s>
<s> they made up for it by getting a special order made immediately after I passed on the buffet. </s>
<s> would highly recommend this hotel -- it has atmosphere and a great view ' if you can get a room with one ; fabulous dinner -- just pass on the breakfast buffet. </s>

<s> booked a couple of rooms and asked in advanced for the reservations to be connected in some way. </s>
<s> rooms were right next to one another as requested. </s>
<s> it was almost everyone 's first time to Chicago ; we had to do a bit of cold-searching for a hotel. </s>
<s> ; our choice was next to perfect. </s>
<s> had an amazing time during my first visit to Chicago and it was largely due to this hotel. </s>
<s> customer service was AMAZING. </s>
<s> was extremely nice and helpful. </s>
<s> of our rooms ordered late night room service and raved about how they felt they had ordered a 5 star lunch because it was as fresh as having ordered food at 2 pm ; and delicious. </s>
<s> friend suggested they had a full-staff at 3 am because the food came up quickly too. </s>
<s> another of our rooms ; housekeeping had accidentally discarded a CD when replacing the CD player with an iPod dock. </s>
<s> concierge had the exact CD purchased and ready at check-out from the neighboring record store. </s>
<s> rate included complimentary breakfast which was fantastic ! Everything was freshly made in their kitchen too. </s>
<s> added bonus was that the hotel is attached to a mall. </s>
<s> ; you do n't need to leave the building to get a pair of shoes ; a coffee ; or a some other type of trinket. </s>
<s> was beyond pleased with this hotel and would stay here again without hesitation. </s>
<s> Omni Chicago Hotel is not pretty as they advertise it. </s>
<s> of all ; it really difficult to get there because its located in down town Chicago and they fail to mention that the traffic is a nightmare. </s>
<s> you finally make to the hotel you have to wait like 30 minutes for the front desk to take care of you. </s>
<s> I arrived there was one person at the desk and a few people checking in ; and I thought the wait time was ridiculous. </s>
<s> make matters worse ; I need internet connection and the day I was there they had technical problems and the Internet was not working in my room. </s>
<s> hours later they managed it get to work ; the connection was still very slow. </s>
<s> my part ; the hotel might look nice but services is did not meet my expectations. </s>
<s> was disappointed and will never stay there again ; if I go back to Chicago. </s>
<s> was rating it ; I would give it 1 '2 star out of 5. </s>
<s> family stayed at this hotel and walking into the Lobby I expected a very good experience. </s>
<s> I made my way to the counter and was Greeted ' Not Really I knew this may be a bad experience. </s>
<s> Customer Service Person was rude and did not wait on me for a few minutes. </s>
<s> I got up to the room it looked like someone had just checked out. </s>
<s> High Chair that we requested still had spots of food on it. </s>
<s> Rest Room had water on the counter and very little toilet paper. </s>
<s> we got settled we went down to the dining room for supper and was disappointed in the service and the food quality for the price we paid. </s>
<s> we only had to stay there one day. </s>
<s> day was almost too long. </s>
<s> James Hotel in Chicago is by far one of the best hotels that My family and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. </s>
<s> room service is the best in the area ; not to mention the spa in the hotel is to die for. </s>
<s> lobby and the reception area is very contemporary. </s>
<s> is a great place to take the family to relax. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel to anyone. </s>
<s> stars ! I just got home from my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel. </s>
<s> and my family were in Chacago for the the week and this hotel was the closest to where we needed to be. </s>
<s> we walked in the door there was a horrid odor. </s>
<s> like a public bathroom. </s>
<s> check in clerk was very irritable and was very uncooperative. </s>
<s> would not let us go to our rooms because our entire family was not there yet ! When we finally got to our rooms the beds were not made and the room was uninviting. </s>
<s> beds felt like we were sleeping on rocks. </s>
<s> the first dreadful night we got up and went downstairs to eat breakfast. </s>
<s> food there tastes and looks like vomit. </s>
<s> rest of the weeks stay there was like living in Hell. </s>
<s> Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel is definitely not a good place to stay. </s>
<s> is actually probably on of the worst hotels I 've ever stayed at. </s>
<s> stayed at the Hilton Chicago back in July. </s>
<s> a " luxury " hotel this place did not meet my expectations. </s>
<s> starters ; we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room would n't be ready for at least another hour ! I 'm used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee. </s>
<s> we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel 's restaurants ; Kitty O 'Sheas. </s>
<s> ; we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks. </s>
<s> we finally got to our room it was OK ; although not great for the price. </s>
<s> had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view ; and there were not extra towels as I had requested. </s>
<s> had to call room service twice to receive them ; then another two times because our air conditioner was n't working. </s>
<s> for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so I could barely use internet on my phone. </s>
<s> time I 'm in the Chicago area I wo n't be staying at the Hilton. </s>
<s> 'd only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money. </s>
<s> daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. </s>
<s> we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. </s>
<s> then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool ; one white phone and one emergency red phone ; to call the desk. </s>
<s> were out of service ! I am glad there was n't an emergency. </s>
<s> we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  never heard back. </s>
<s> experience at the Hyatt Regency Chicago was simply amazing. </s>
<s> had a wonderful stay there will my husband. </s>
<s> husband has allergy problems nearly everywhere we go ; and we were worried about that so we talked to the desk clerk there. </s>
<s> were able to provide us with a Hyatt allergy-friendly room. </s>
<s> were so relieved and the room was beautiful. </s>
<s> furniture in the room was actually cleaned with pure tea tree oil. </s>
<s> was the most comfortable stay we have ever had. </s>
<s> top of that my husband had to spend some time in the room working on some business ; so the high speed internet they provided was very convenient. </s>
<s> took full advantage of the 24 hour room service. </s>
<s> will definitely stay there again. </s>
<s> is a vacation simply staying in your hotel room. </s>
