<s> IsTruthFul,IsPositive,review When making my reservation ; I made it for one of the most busiest weekends during the summer Memorial Day. </s>
<s> staff was able to get my family in at an affordable rate. </s>
<s> suites are very spacious ; clean ; cozy ; and comfortable. </s>
<s> on arriving staff were friendly ; willing to exceed expectations ; and serve me with enthusiasm. </s>
<s> Hot Breakfast was delicious each morning. </s>
<s> beds are very comfortable and provided a good nights rest. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone who need additional space when traveling and on a budget compared to other Chicago hotels. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed at the James Chicago Hotel for our anniversary. </s>
<s> place is fantastic ! We knew as soon as we arrived we made the right choice ! The rooms are BEAUTIFUL and the staff very attentive and wonderful ! The area of the hotel is great ; since I love to shop I could n't ask for more ! We will definatly be back to Chicago and we will for sure be back to the James Chicago. </s>
<s> M ; Louisville ; KY Booked through Hotwire and consequently was placed in a room where we barely had room to walk around our luggage. </s>
<s> ' view was of the ' inner courtyard of nothing but walls of windows of the other rooms. </s>
<s> were unable to determine what the weather was outside except that it was either day or night. </s>
<s> no longer have in-room coffee appliances. </s>
<s> either have to go down to their ostentatious dining room ; or go around the corner to Starbucks or McDonald 's. </s>
<s> access is not free $ 12. </s>
<s> '24 hours ; the " Gift Shop " is a joke ' tucked away in the corner of the coat check room ; Concierge services have limited hours ; and the business center is open only during ' business hours which made it difficult to get work done after ' business hours. </s>
<s> " 
I would not stay there ever again ; nor do I recommend it to anyone. </s>
<s> have had better stays at any Holiday Inn Express ! Me and my husband stayed in the Allegro Hotel Chicago for 4 days 3 nights recently. </s>
<s> got a room with a king size bed . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
Although the room is small ; we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages all. </s>
<s> ; we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable ; the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us. </s>
<s> walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound. </s>
<s> of the days ; our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels ; rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign. </s>
<s> worst is upon returning to the hotel at night ; we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage. </s>
<s> housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins. </s>
<s> is unacceptable to us. </s>
<s> hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night. </s>
<s> it is near the CTA trains ; i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view. </s>
<s> staying again at a Kimpton hotel in San Fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change ! Overall ; not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to Chicago again ! After staying at the James Chicago last weekend I can honestly say I will be going for affordability on my next trip. </s>
<s> James Chicago is terribly overpriced and the staff was very cold and disconnected. </s>
<s> chairs in the room looked like something out of Ikea. </s>
<s> love Chicago but this hotel is definitely not one of its better places to stay. </s>
<s> believe I would have been better off and happier staying at the Holiday Inn. </s>
<s> do n't always get what you pay for. </s>
<s> husband and I were there for a conference and had booked the room thru their website ; when called to confirm had us down for only 1 night instead of 4 ; easily changed. </s>
<s> morning cold ; cold shower ; did n't complain ; next day fine. </s>
<s> did not work ; called every day to complain ; and every day said it would be fixed when got back to room ; never was. </s>
<s> dial tone ; unable to call restaurant ; or call for car or call for room service. </s>
<s> ; on last night someone came to our room while we were there and did fix it. </s>
<s> hotel is beautiful ; rooms great and everyone was so nice ; even when I was complaining they were nice. </s>
<s> gym area also ; and love the restaurant. </s>
<s> ; for the money I could easily find another hotel just as nice with a working phone. </s>
<s> company booked our group for a Conference and Sales Meeting. </s>
<s> service was friendly ; helpful and the property was beautiful. </s>
<s> hotel was clean and filled with history. </s>
<s> thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the rate was reasonable as well. </s>
<s> was a great place to be ! Great views of river and lake ; walk to everything ; a clean and comfortable room ; and very accommodating staff. </s>
<s> arrived early and were checked in by 10 : 30 am and checked out late ; effectively adding two days to our vacation. </s>
<s> is a large hotel but the staff works hard and takes good care of the customers. </s>
<s> Chicago Palmer House disappointed me. </s>
<s> chose it because it a Hilton hotel ; but it definitely does not live up to the standard set by this name. </s>
<s> first impression was a negative one when I was greeted by a rather rude staff. </s>
<s> room might have been luxurious years ago ; but the general impression was that it had not been cleaned regularly and could use a little freshening. </s>
<s> bathroom was obviously newer but the shower was difficult to use and the water pressure was absolutely horrible. </s>
<s> food served by the room service and at the hotel 's restaurant sounded delicious on the carefully crafted menus ; and the high prices made me expect delicate cuisine. </s>
<s> food simply did not deliver its promises. </s>
<s> tasted very bland and the portions were ridiculously small. </s>
<s> location of the hotel might seem like an advantage ; since it is in downtown Chicago nearby many touristic attractions : however ; the windows in my room did not protect me from the constant noise of cars going by. </s>
<s> ; this hotel would be decent if it did not advertise itself as a luxury hotel and did not use the Hilton name and price range. </s>
<s> was really excited when we booked a night at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> was actually beyond our budget ; but my husband and I needed a weekend away ; so I decided to splurge for the occasion. </s>
<s> WASTE OF MY MONEY EVER ! Our room was smaller than pictured online ; and it looked like the maid did n't vacuum the carpet ! We visited the hotel restaurant ; Angels and Kings ; one night for dinner and the drinks were overpriced and my husband 's steak was cooked wrong ' he ordered medium ; but received a well-done steak. </s>
<s> the end of our trip we were so glad to leave ; but they were under-staffed and the Sunday morning checkout line was so long that we waited in line for 30 minutes until we could check out. </s>
<s> was a fun city ; but next time we return I 'll be choosing a different hotel - and I suggest you do too ! Located right in the heart of downtown Chicago i visited this hotel on a business trip. </s>
<s> first things i noticed was how friendly the staff is ; and how clean the rooms are ' even compared to other luxury hotels seeing as i had a night layover before my meeting i decided to stop by the Terrace and get a drink ; i got a mojito and i must say i was very impressed ; i 've had my share of mojitos and it was one of the better ones ; once i retired back to my room i found the sound system to be excellent ; bed was soft and the TV did n't appear burned out at all. </s>
<s> i give this a five out of five ; the staff was helpful and friendly the whole time and the atmosphere was perfect ; i wish i could have stayed longer. </s>
<s> you are traveling to Chicago and need a place to stay ; I highly recommend the Hotel Allegro Chicago. </s>
<s> was visiting time visiting Chicago for the first time on a business trip and a friend referred me to the Hotel Allegro. </s>
<s> said they were pet friendly ; which was a huge plus. </s>
<s> is because I hate leaving my kitten muffin with a pet sitter every time I travel for business. </s>
<s> my arrival ; I was met with friendly valet who treated me like I was the only customer who mattered. </s>
<s> walked in and saw a hotel like no other I have seen before or after. </s>
<s> lobby was decorated with modern furniture and paintings and looked like a place I could relax in. </s>
<s> I had entered and checked in ; I saw the staircase ; which looked like a testament to the staircase in the " Titanic " . </s>
<s> ; I was amazed and I had not even entered my room yet. </s>
<s> room was a Queen Deluxe room and it was amazing. </s>
<s> bed had a blue headboard ; which I have never seen before ; and the colors worked together so well I seriously contemplated living there. </s>
<s> room service was exceptional and promptly brought the food I ordered. </s>
<s> I wanted to get a drink and I enjoyed it at The Bar 312 ; which is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel. </s>
<s> are the specifics of my stay ; but there is much more to be experienced that I did not mention if you visit the Hotel Allegro. </s>
<s> summary ; they allow pets ; the service is amazing ; the decoration superb ; and it is conveniently situated next to dining establishments. </s>
<s> more could a person ask for ? I will never stay at Conrad Chicago again. </s>
<s> employees were rude from the begining. </s>
<s> I asked for extra towels the lady at the front desk looked like I was an inconveniece. </s>
<s> bar staff was n't much better. </s>
<s> maids never came and changed our sheet during our stay. </s>
<s> not go there ! The Swissotel Chicago was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at in Chicago. </s>
<s> was clean ; modern ; and the staff were very friendly ; even to our large family with cranky kids at a very late hour. </s>
<s> room was fantastic and you can not beat it for the price. </s>
<s> only was the room fantastic ; but so was the view. </s>
<s> room looked out over the skyline and it was breathtaking ; especially at night. </s>
<s> best part of the hotel was its location. </s>
<s> was located within walking distance to so many fun attractions ; including Navy Pier and the Sears Tower. </s>
<s> stay was wonderful ; and we ca n't wait to go back again. </s>
<s> Chicago has a multitude of available hotels. </s>
<s> once youve decided to step away from the ordinary a fantastic way to get away from it all is by booking a stay at the Homewood suites. </s>
<s> combination of luxury and affordability is evident as soon as youve entered the glamourous lobby. </s>
<s> Downtown Homewood suites is located near all the attractions which make Chicago the diverse and culturally rich town that is world known. </s>
<s> hotel offers a free fitness center ; high speed wireless internet as well as a complimentary buffet breakfast. </s>
<s> a member of the Hilton family ensures the utmost in quality and service which has been observed by millions of customers around the world. </s>
<s> concierge was so helpful. </s>
<s> hesitation they had the best recommendations for restaurants and attractions all turning out to be wonderful. </s>
<s> even gave us business cards for restaurants that did not take reservations so we could obtain preferential or immediate seating 's. </s>
<s> the health club at the back of the hotel. </s>
<s> joining the presidents club ; it only cost ten dollars a day to use the facilities. </s>
<s> rooms were large ; updated and had views looking out in 3 directions. </s>
<s> coffee maker in the room was exceptional. </s>
<s> is great for getting mostly anywhere. </s>
<s> is overpriced so we took our cart to the underground Millennium Garage that was only $ 25. </s>
<s> per 24 hours and a few blocks walk from the hotel. </s>
<s> what other are saying ; this was one ; if not the best Hotel stay in Chicago I have had. </s>
<s> travel to the Big City about three times a year for pleasure and The James rates up with the best. </s>
<s> was upgraded and the staff made the stay worth my special weekend visit. </s>
<s> do n't believe you will be disapointed. </s>
<s> Talbott Hotel - My girlfriend and I stayed at the Talbott last weekend for leisure ' our 2 year anniversary. </s>
<s> was fairly quick. </s>
<s> we got to our room ; we were blown away. </s>
<s> room ' king guest room was extremely nice and high quality. </s>
<s> our room having a huge king size bed ; there was still an ample around a floor space and roominess in general. </s>
<s> bed itself was dangerously comfortable ; so much so that I almost fell asleep the minute I tried it out ! The bathroom was just as roomy as the main area ; and had a separate shower from tub. </s>
<s> best part of the bathroom was the sink ' strange to hear ; but true. </s>
<s> dual vanity sink was made of beautiful granite ; and allowed my girlfriend I enough space to use each sink at the same time with no problem. </s>
<s> amenities were Molton Brown. </s>
<s> decided to eat at the hotel restaurant ; Little Market Brasserie ; the first night because we were tired ; and it was anything but a " backup choice. </s>
<s> " 
The menu was pleasantly diverse and the quality of the ingredients was excellent. </s>
<s> of the hotel is approximately 2 blocks from Washington Square Park ; and made for easy sight seeing. </s>
<s> ; we were very pleased with our stay and recommend this hotel to all. </s>
<s> staying at the Sheraton Royal Orchid Hotel in Bangkok ; I was expecting a similar experience at the Chicago Sheraton. </s>
<s> had a wonderful stay at this property seven years ago and was looking forward to a repeat experience. </s>
<s> ; my expectations were not met. </s>
<s> the past 3 years I stayed at the Palmer House in the Loop ; but thought I 'd try a more modern hotel. </s>
<s> - location by the Chicago River ; two blocks from Michigan Avenue - restful lobby with river view and free wifi provides a pleasant work environment - buffet breakfast offering custom omelettes ; crepes and french toast CONS - check-in assigned me to a city view room when I had prepaid for a river view room - river view was good ; but the windows to see it were filthy - dirty towel used by the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the bathroom door - bathroom was unimpressive : bathtub-shower combination ; worn plumbing fixtures ; only 2 sets of towels provided - guest room was small : only one soft chair provided - guest room doors slammed noisily throughout the floor hallway - 7 to 8 block walk to nearest L-station - concierge could n't explain how to get to the Mercury Theatre ; nor print a map of the area - guest services told me to go out of the hotel one block to get Starbucks coffee when it was available downstairs on the Link Cafe - no complimentary newspaper delivered to the room - no final billing folio delivered to the room on the night before check-out - not all computers were operational at the Link Cafe where boarding passes can be printed I stayed at the Affnia hotel in Chicago and was extremely unsatisfied. </s>
<s> would recommend everyone to avoid this hotel. </s>
<s> paid $ 700 overall for 2 nights in a cheap ; small ; untidy room. </s>
<s> ; I 've stayed at hotels of similar quality ; but never have I paid so much for one of them ! I could not believe what I saw when I walked into the room . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it was tiny and there was small patches of mold on the wall ' that had been painted over. </s>
<s> breakfast I ordered was n't terrible ; but certainly was n't good. </s>
<s> wifi connection was horrendously slow. </s>
<s> you want to spend a big buck on a hotel ; fine . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> just do n't spend it here. </s>
<s> Hotel- I have certain expectations for my hotel ; as I travel on business frequently ; and quite honestly ; the Talbot did not do it for me. </s>
<s> ; I understand it is close to all the clubs for younger people ; but it should also at the same time provide some of the features they promise. </s>
<s> WIFI was NOT high speed at all ; I found myself needing to walk to different corners of the room just to get a signal. </s>
<s> service was 24 hours but it was extremely slow the two times I ordered ; and the staff did n't even apologize for their tardiness. </s>
<s> ; this place gave me a room to stay in ; but did n't give me any enjoyment from an already stressful work trip. </s>
<s> you want to stay in a fabulous hotel in the city and you 're willing to pay a little extra ; I 'd recommend this place. </s>
<s> ; pay the extra for a corner room - the views of the city are spectacular. </s>
<s> short walk to Michigan Avenue. </s>
<s> service from the valets ; concierge ; lobby agents ; and waitstaff in the restaurants. </s>
<s> food in the restaurants was great and room service was n't too shabby either. </s>
<s> worth the money ! Excellent location ; about a block from Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> and two blocks from Water Tower Place and John Hancock Tower. </s>
<s> hotel ; felt very luxurious and high-class for being a moderate priced hotel. </s>
<s> was excellent -- friendly and accommodating. </s>
<s> booked this hotel for my family of 4 to stay overnight to see the Magnificent Mile Christmas Lights Parade. </s>
<s> chose it because it had a sofa sleeper and one bed. </s>
<s> arrived at our hotel around 3 : 30 PM to check in. </s>
<s> came at this time because the front desk worker said that we could not check in until 3 : 00 PM. </s>
<s> giving him our name ; the manager said ; " OK ; we have your king smoking suite available " . </s>
<s> quickly corrected him to let him know that we were traveling with two very young kids and we reserved a non-smoking room. </s>
<s> insisted that his computer said that we reserved a smoking room. </s>
<s> went back and forth ; then he asked us if we had a copy of our reservation. </s>
<s> ; we were able to pull the reservation up on our phone. </s>
<s> clearly said non-smoking. </s>
<s> showing him our reservation ; he explained that there was nothing that he could do to correct the situation because they had no other rooms available. </s>
<s> why in the world did he need to see our reservation ! We decided to see if we could handle the smoking room. </s>
<s> turns out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non smoker there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children. </s>
<s> manager eventually called around and found a hampton inn near by with one bed. </s>
<s> canceled our room reservation. </s>
<s> live about an hour away from downtown so we made the late night trip back home. </s>
<s> family was very disappointed. </s>
<s> husband is a gold member with Hilton. </s>
<s> 's just say we will be switching back to Marriott. </s>
<s> hotel lobby was dated. </s>
<s> smoking room that I saw looked very dated as well. </s>
<s> made an error and never owned up to it ; nor did they do anything to compensate us for such a huge inconvenience. </s>
<s> visit started off on the wrong foot when we entered the lobby struggling to carry all of our luggage and ; instead of helping ; a group of hotel employees stood watching and laughing at us. </s>
<s> had trouble locating our reservation. </s>
<s> room was tiny ! When I 'm paying over $ 400 a night for a room ; I expect to be able to walk around in it ! The beds were also tiny. </s>
<s> walls were thin and we could hear our neighbors talking next door. </s>
<s> hotel was probably once beautiful and classy ; but now it seems to be outdated and due for repairs. </s>
<s> n't be staying here again. </s>
<s> stay at the Talbott was a wonderful experience. </s>
<s> service at this upscale hotel was beyond my expectations ; the Gold Coast location is close to Michigan Ave ; the museums ; and many of the other sites Chicago has to offer. </s>
<s> you are visiting Chicago ; I highly recommend the Talbott ! When we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago ; we had one of the worst visits i have ever experienced. </s>
<s> room was not ready right away so we had to wait about an hour in the lobby. </s>
<s> finally when we made it to our room we found a moldy shower and a dirty floor. </s>
<s> room service took about an hours and a half to come to the room and she we went to the pool that day ; it was so crowded there was no room to sit on the side. </s>
<s> experience was definitely not a pleasant one. </s>
<s> make matters even worse ; we were billed twice for our room which my husband luckily caught before we left. </s>
<s> am never coming back to Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel. </s>
<s> during a busy 2day conference in Chicago. </s>
<s> hotels booked solid. </s>
<s> full hotel allows you to meet a wide array of customers. </s>
<s> is complaining about service ; cleanliness ; and overall experience. </s>
<s> is good. </s>
<s> is tired. </s>
<s> surly. </s>
<s> many cool properties to choose from in this town ; will never stay here again and will re-think Hilton in general I am usually a big fan of Kimpton Hotels ; but this place is awful ! I would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. </s>
<s> is an old ; dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more " botique " . </s>
<s> carpets are dirty ; and tattered ; patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet. </s>
<s> ! The bathrooms are tiny ; and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them. </s>
<s> we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned ; we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way. </s>
<s> woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table. </s>
<s> told the front desk ; called housekeeping ; and then called the front desk again . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> finally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum. </s>
<s> elevators are slow ; and often only one is working at any given time. </s>
<s> did not find the staff to be friendly at all ; except for one waiter breakfast. </s>
<s> a disappointment : This is one of my favorite Sheratons 'Starwood properties. </s>
<s> have stayed at a lot of hotels ' mostly Starwood in Chi but all around ; this is my favorite based on cost ; amenities and downtown location. </s>
<s> really like it beginning with unloading the taxi because I am greeted by Nick who has been there for years. </s>
<s> gives the best greeting from LA to NY and is always happy ! He obviously loves his job. </s>
<s> at the front desk are always nice and efficient. </s>
<s> you like to workout ; Roberta runs their fitness center. </s>
<s> one who loves their job and serves guests well. </s>
<s> lake river view while working out. </s>
<s> this particular trip I was caught in a pinch ; however ; Christy the former mgr was able to take care of a frequent guest. </s>
<s> considered it a " minor miracle " based on hotel availability. </s>
<s> maids on 29th floor were very friendly and efficient. </s>
<s> great experience. </s>
<s> stay at the Hilton was like living in luxury for a few days. </s>
<s> never wanted to go back home much less leave the hotel. </s>
<s> my stay I could work out in their facility and swim at no added charge. </s>
<s> fact ; they did n't charge for WIFI ; morning breakfast or their grocery shopping service. </s>
<s> lobby always had complimentary coffee ; tea ; soda and meals ! I felt like a queen. </s>
<s> hotel deserves highest marks for service. </s>
<s> Hotel- Came out to Chicago for my buddie 's bachelor party. </s>
<s> are from the midwest and we thought this was intuitive ; so we decided to stay at the Talbot. </s>
<s> had a great time : it was rowdy of course ; but it was pleasant to stay in such a central area close to all the clubs. </s>
<s> the heart of the Gold Coast ; we were right where you want to be when it comes to nightlife. </s>
<s> the rooms themselves were extremely well set up. </s>
<s> suite was the way to go : we had 42 inch TV ; newspaper delivery ; and high-speed wireless which helped us form our gameplan for exploring our new area. </s>
<s> sofas were essential too ; and very conducive to having multiple people in one room together. </s>
<s> ; this hotel was ideal : spacious with all the amenities you would ever need ; but also close to any place we would ever want to go. </s>
<s> had really high hopes for this hotel. </s>
<s> location seemed great and the prices were too. </s>
<s> ; you get what you pay for. </s>
<s> being located near the miracle mile and navy pier ; there were n't many other redeeming qualities. </s>
<s> staff was very rude. </s>
<s> arrived late after a long drive from Detroit and found nobody in the lobby to help us check in. </s>
<s> we finally got checked in ; our room had n't been cleaned and there was trash left over from the last people. </s>
<s> were told the cleaning staff had gone home for the night and they could n't get to it until morning ! We had planned on seeing some of Chicago 's attractions like the Field Museum but we could hardly find anyone to help us out with where to go. </s>
<s> website advertises lots of specials and packages but we found absolutely no way to purchase them. </s>
<s> ; when we checked out ; they had charged our room an extra cleaning fee because the cleaning we requested on the first night. </s>
<s> ! This hotel was PERFECT for our girls getaway. </s>
<s> decor is fun refreshing. </s>
<s> the roof top bar. </s>
<s> staff member was friendly always smiling. </s>
<s> location is perfect for Michigan Ave shopping ; the beach ; dinner and night life. </s>
<s> was a mile or two from Millenium Station. </s>
<s> concierge recommended a couple places to hang out after dinner and added our names to the guest list ' I 'm sure they do it all the time but still a nice gesture. </s>
<s> - I stayed in Allegro Hotel 's King Suite in December when I visited Chicago for a company event. </s>
<s> have to say that my stay was absolutely pathetic. </s>
<s> though I had booked the room earlier ; it seemed that they had not arranged for it. </s>
<s> had to wait for more than an hour at the reception even though I turned up late in the afternoon. </s>
<s> staff did not even seem to be bothered and their apology seemed superficial. </s>
<s> ; when I used the bathroom in the morning ; the Jacuzzi was not working which is something that I hated because I did not have enough time to request for a room change. </s>
<s> the food which I ordered through room service was good. </s>
<s> ; I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. </s>
<s> you would would expect from a top-notch hotel and exceeded by the service. </s>
<s> trendy decor and easy to access dining gave us a ' second-wind pick up after a day of sight-seeing. </s>
<s> hotel is definitely the place that I want to come back to. </s>
<s> the time we left after 4 days and 3 nights ; my wife and I wished we had more time to enjoy the restaurant a few more times and the delightful Swiss flare. </s>
<s> of the things we enjoyed the most was seeing the water from our window. </s>
<s> feeling of being pampered can only come from the very gracious hotel staff and this hotel is number 1 in my mind. </s>
<s> high priced hotel I 've ever stayed at ! I had a business meeting in Chicago and heard good reviews from a few co-workers thought it would be a nice place to stay but was a little upset with my experience with Swissotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> desk clerk was very rude at check in ; valet parking was great until they brought my SUV around front with a quarter size dent in the passenger size door ; the hotel refused to pay for the damages. </s>
<s> room was very beautiful besides the faint mildew smell in the room. </s>
<s> service was great and very pleasing !Our business meeting took place in the St Gallen room where our meeting took a little disruptive turn ; there was construction going on during that time and was very hard to hear the announcer in our meeting. </s>
<s> than that the hotel was beautiful but the stay was n't as great as i expected ; you may want to book somewhere else if you have a business meeting to attend in Chicago. </s>
<s> a my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I contemplated the the poor quality of my experienc there and felt the need to document it. </s>
<s> the amenities were plush ; the service of the staff was lacking. </s>
<s> check in ; my reservation was " lost " and it took over 30 minutes for the manager to make arraingments for my stay. </s>
<s> was no offer to upgrade me or comp me in any way. </s>
<s> service did a poor job in cleaning my room and left wet towles in the bath room. </s>
<s> used coffee filter was left in the coffee pot for me to clean out. </s>
<s> am not sure my sheets were changed out. </s>
<s> I checked out ; the bell hop dropped my laptop and destroyed my hard drive leaving me to scramble to recover the report I spent days creating. </s>
<s> my negative experience has left me wondering if they train thier staff on the proper way to attend to their customers. </s>
<s> will be relunctant to stay with them again until I am assured they have focused on trainging their staff better. </s>
<s> connected to Affinia Chicago thorugh a city websight. </s>
<s> deal was fair for a downtown hotel on the main drag with an attractiion included. </s>
<s> was information out there that the hotel was being overhauled although we did not pay much attention to that. </s>
<s> are currently under major construction. </s>
<s> will be a little late of their projections in the finish date. </s>
<s> must say that the staff tried very hard to make our stay comfortable under very difficult circumstances. </s>
<s> room was complete and was good. </s>
<s> had a very nice bathroom. </s>
<s> main lobbie and all hotel amenities are totally unfinished drywall with no food ; drink ; or rest room opportunities. </s>
<s> construction guys did their best to limit activity and noise to after 9 : 00am. </s>
<s> think this will be a good one once they are done. </s>
<s> of the end of May ; they have a way yet to go. </s>
<s> was attending a conference at the Mariott. </s>
<s> were booked up and I shared a room at the Hard Rock for a week by default. </s>
<s> a lucky break. </s>
<s> is a beautiful hotel. </s>
<s> am not a fan of all that black 'grey vibe and find it a little cheesy. </s>
<s> I loved was the way the Hard Rock left the beautiful old hotel features intact ; and decorated around the basic stucture. </s>
<s> room was CLEAN ; CLEAN ; CLEAN. </s>
<s> want to comment on the staff. </s>
<s> an upbeat group of people. </s>
<s> included the doormen ; the front desk ; the consierge. </s>
<s> were wonderful ! Every morning one of the bell men would find my TV morning news show for me in the bar ; while I drank their courtesy coffee. </s>
<s> brought us a refrigerator ; IPOD dock ; and extra suitcase stand within minutes of check-in. </s>
<s> had a hard time contacting the airport transport. </s>
<s> consierge took care of it for me. </s>
<s> I was waiting for the 4 : 50 am airport shuttle ; one of the bell men found me a cup of coffee in the back. </s>
<s> just could n't get over how nice and friendly everyone was . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> great place to stay. </s>
<s> hope to go back with my husband. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago to celebrate our ten year anniversary. </s>
<s> could not have picked a better locate. </s>
<s> price of the hotel was really affordable for a couple on a tight budget. </s>
<s> flat screen television and the comfortable beds were a favorite of mine. </s>
<s> husband loved the Stetson Steakhouse and the 24 hour stay fit gym. </s>
<s> really did not leave the hotel during I stay there because basically everything you need is only a walk or phone call away. </s>
<s> we ever travel to this area again this would be my first and only pick for a wonderful stay. </s>
<s> hotel gets four thumbs up from my husband and I. </s>
<s> a wonderful ten years celebration. </s>
<s> this is a good location for shopping and sightseeing ; I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. </s>
<s> rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny ; all of which is to be expected in an old urban hotel ; but apparently care has not been given to updating the hotel ' ever !. </s>
<s> crown molding and base boards are cracked and it appears to only have been painted over and over again. </s>
<s> newer tub liner in the bathroom is merely floating above the old tub and when you stand in the shower it bubbles under your feet. </s>
<s> shower tiles are old and the grout is not clean. </s>
<s> hotel has not been restored the updating that has been done are merely band-aides. </s>
<s> is no fan exhaust in the bathroom and the carpet is ontop of a very hard surface ; probaly concrete with no pad in between. </s>

<s> were in town on business and supposed to stay 4 nights ; we left after 2 and went to another hotel. </s>

<s> a long day ; seeing a substantial line at check-in was a bit of a groaner ; but then i saw the self-serve kiosks. </s>

<s> wish i could live there. </s>

<s> stayed in a room like that once with a friend and we did n't know ahead of time that we had two bathrooms. </s>
<s> about squeals of delight. </s>
<s> was about 7 years ago in virginia beach. </s>
<s> was by myself at the hilton and had no need for a room with two bathrooms ; but it 's the first time i 've seen this since. </s>
<s> a great feature ! My stay at the The James was perfect. </s>
<s> room was thoughtfully designed : the lighting ; the storage space ; the bar area ; the eating nook and everything else in the room was purposeful and pretty to look at. </s>
<s> staff was friendly and and genuinely accomadating. </s>
<s> restaurant ' Primehouse echoed the above. </s>
<s> service and one of the best steaks I 've had in a very long time. </s>
<s> stayed at the monaco for the Labor day weekend when I visited my family in Chicago. </s>
<s> is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at in my life. </s>
<s> ; comfortable and pretty. </s>
<s> rooms were clean and the staff is very caring. </s>
<s> needed some more glasses as my family was sharing drink. </s>
<s> front desk had them sent up in less than 10 minutes. </s>

<s> Affinia Hotel is beautiful ! It 's in a great location ; the service is top-notch ; and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious. </s>
<s> look of the hotel is very modern ; but it feels warm and cozy ; too. </s>

<s> were only in Chicago on our way home. </s>
<s> did n't know where to stay in Chicago ; but booked one night at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based on their ad in the Chicago Visitors Guide. </s>
<s> 're glad we did ! We enjoyed our stay very much. </s>
<s> room was very comfortable and well appointed and had a wonderful view of the city. </s>
<s> 's what we wanted -- a great view ; and we got it. </s>
<s> ; the hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and is accessible from the bus stop ' we took the train and bus from the airport into the city and it was n't bad -- saved us a lot of money. </s>
<s> elevators to our room were fast and quick and there was one always available. </s>
<s> found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating. </s>
<s> only downside for us is that we had only booked one night in Chicago. </s>
<s> wish we could have stayed there at the Sheraton for at least another night. </s>
<s> would definitely stay there again. </s>
<s> husband and i made a reservation for 2sure nights but decided to stay just the second night. </s>

<s> as well. </s>
<s> called and they said the hotel wouldnt authorize a cancellation per the terms and agreement. </s>

<s> spoke with the mgr Erica and she said Erica would honor that if i could provide a name. </s>
<s> got his name and callex back and he told the bookit consultant that he " didnt recall " saying that. </s>
<s> was so furious that i called him on 3the way with the bookit consultant and he just lied ! He said ; no ma 'am i dont remember saying that. </s>
<s> said so since you dont remember thats it ? ? ? I said my husband heard him say it b 'c he was on speaker phone since we were driving on the way there. </s>
<s> asked to speak to Erica ; told her the situation and she said she cant go off of heresay and couldnt honor what her employee screwed up on. </s>

<s> have never writte. </s>
<s> review for a hotel before but i am going to go out of my way to make sure corporate sees this. </s>
<s> was very unprofessional and cared more about not taking sides than she did about making sure the guests feel welcome. </s>
<s> DISAPPOINTED ! WILL NEVER STAY AGAIN ! The InterContinental Chicago hotel terrible. </s>
<s> of all ; the continental breakfast was a joke. </s>
<s> food was unhealthy and unsatisfactory. </s>
<s> our first night ; we expected the maid to come clean up our room. </s>
<s> came back from site-seeing to find that our room was in the same condition we left it in. </s>
<s> will never go back to this hotel again. </s>
<s> had a great experience at this hotel. </s>
<s> hotel is Huge ! The rooms were very clean ; well appointed ; and our room was very roomy with a great view of the snow covered park. </s>
<s> Staff was so nice and very helpfull. </s>
<s> ; at the the Concierge desk scored us tickets to WICKED the day of the performance ; and on a Holiday weekend too. </s>
<s> were great seats and a reasonable price. </s>
<s> worked very hard for us to see that show. </s>
<s> truely topped off what was a Fun New Years Celebration. </s>
<s> will be my first pick when I return in the spring. </s>
<s> a room w a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful NYE ; and was rather disappointed. </s>
<s> was either the world 's smallest queen ; or was actually a double ; not to mention it was uncomfortably springy. </s>
<s> of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used ' q-tips. </s>
<s> of noise seemed to carry through the vents as we could hear other rooms rather clearly. </s>
<s> the tv was off ; there was a very audible high-pitched humming noise that we could not get rid of unless we unplugged the tv. </s>
<s> water was very inconsistent in the shower. </s>
<s> is in a great location ; however ; next time I will try one of the other hotels in the area like the Intercontinental or Marriott. </s>
<s> might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business ; but I would n't recommend it for a romantic night or two. </s>
<s> Omni was chosen for it 's location whichworked out perfectly. </s>
<s> bedding was wondeful and everything seemed fairly clean . </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> until . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> I sat down in the tub . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there was BLACK MOLD in the soap holder ; in the cracks on the walls between the tile ; all under the tile overhang above the tub and completely around the toilet bowl. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> I really do n't care for showers. </s>
<s> yes . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the toilet leaked as well . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> The staff were very helpful but I was disappointed. </s>
<s> travel extensively and do n't think I will return. </s>
<s> needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken ; so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel ; printed the presentation and delivered it to our room. </s>
<s> try ! We booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the 10th floor with a view of the windows of another building . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but we were n't there too much. </s>
<s> I decided to stay at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park ; the only thing that I had on my mind was the idea of taking that time to relax and enjoy some time with my husband. </s>
<s> ; the hotel choice was n't the best. </s>
<s> in the front desk when we arrived there we had problems with our reservation. </s>
<s> room that we had reserved was occupied and so we had to switch to some other room ; which was much smaller than the original one. </s>
<s> hotel did give us a discount ; but if I 'd paid for the large room was because I wanted the it. </s>
<s> hotel with this name should n't put its guests in these kind of situation. </s>
<s> wont be reserving room there again. </s>
<s> Chicago ; Millennium Park - " Fairmont Chicago is definitely not worth the fuss they are making ! I mean yes ; the venue is great but other than that it fails to impress you. </s>
<s> I was in my room ; I could continuously hear people walking ; entering the rooms and talking . </s>
<s> was so annoying ! The cleaning staff is not that efficient ; the cleaning lady did not replace the shampoo in the bathroom so I had to call them up and request for it. </s>
<s> it took them 2 hours to actually replace it ! The parking is extremely expensive and so is the food. </s>
<s> does n't live up to its award winning standards. </s>
<s> ; I have had better experience at Fairmont at other locations. </s>
<s> Chicago ; look for other places to stay. </s>
<s> " 
amalfihotelchicago - I would not recommend this place to others because I felt the room was too stuffy and the staff was not co-operative. </s>
<s> shower in our room was broken and it took nearly 4 hours to get it fixed and they did not even moven us to another room ! If you want to get some work done when you are here then that is nearly impossible because the conference rooms are small and dimly lit. </s>
<s> gym is sub-standard with a lot of equipment either missing or broken. </s>
<s> SUPER FAST INTERNET ! I always worry when I leave home for a while that the Wi-Fi will be shoddy ; but no worries here ! ALL over the hotel it was good on my phone and laptop. </s>
<s> and my brother actually walked from the 53rd floor to the lobby and had good signal everywhere. </s>
<s> the ends of each floor ; they have these ginormous windows that looked out onto the nearby river and some of the coolest and weirdest skyscrapers I 've seen in a while. </s>
<s> tried to go to the river later ; but it started to rain on us ; so we went to the Jacuzzi which we spotted on our tour of the different floors. </s>
<s> would n't bring food up to us in the Jacuzzi ; so I ran down a couple flights of stairs to grab some of the complementary foods from my room ; which actually were n't that bad tasting ! It stopped raining pretty late at night ; so we never got to see the river up close ; but I definitely want to come back here so that I can get a chance to at another time. </s>
<s> stayed for two nights for a meeting. </s>
<s> is an upscale chain hotel and was very clean. </s>
<s> service was very good ; as the hotel front desk employees were kind and knowledgeable. </s>
<s> rooms are decent sized and have soft mattresses. </s>
<s> restaurant has good seafood ; but was a bit expensive. </s>
<s> would come back again. </s>
<s> time at The Talbott. </s>
<s> I planned my vacation to Chicago I called ahead and made reservations to stay here. </s>
<s> I went to check in I was told I did n't have a reservation ; knowing my credit card was charged I argued with the guy who was working. </s>
<s> the only option he gave me was to speak with someone else. </s>
<s> they knew how to use the computer. </s>
<s> go up to my room and there was a terrible smell of beer and feet. </s>
<s> could not believe it when I complained ; I was told to spray some air freshener. </s>
<s> had to go visit family. </s>
<s> I got back my room key did not work. </s>
<s> again there I was complaining to the helpless employee. </s>
<s> told me the magnetic strip must of came in contact with a magnet. </s>
<s> could not believe the mentality of this guy. </s>
<s> had one more night reserved ; I could not take it anymore and I went and spent the rest of my vacation at my Aunts house. </s>
<s> would not recommend The Talbott to anyone. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in March ; 2006. </s>
<s> had a great time ! We were upgraded to a suite ; and enjoyed the jacuzzi tub with Mr. </s>
<s> Bubbles ; animal print robes ; and a luxurious king- sized bed ! THe suite was very nice ; and we had no problem with noise from other rooms or from the street. </s>
<s> was very boutiquey ; and the lobby was lovely. </s>
<s> enjoyed the complementary wine hour. </s>
<s> staff was attentive ; and our stay in this Kimpton hotel made our first-time trip to Chicago memorable ! We would return here ! Just returned from a one night stay at the Knickerbocker ; and I will not return. </s>
<s> came nowhere near being worth the price I paid. </s>
<s> Burnham is twice the hotel at half the price ! The bathroom was unbelieveably small and smelled terribly. </s>
<s> had to call the front desk twice before towels that we requested were delivered ' which frankly may as well have been paper towels ; nothing plush about them at all. </s>
<s> did n't have enough pillows and when we requested an extra it was never delivered. </s>
<s> service cart was left outside our door all night. </s>
<s> in all ; it was a very disappointing stay. </s>
<s> only redeeming quality of this hotel seems to be its location. </s>
<s> for me ; it 's just not worth it. </s>
<s> years ago ; we had a tiny " room " and indifferent service. </s>
<s> time ; the service was superb and friendly throughout ; with special commendation for the waiters and waitresses at the coffee shop ; the door and bell persons ; and the hilton honors person at the front desk. </s>
<s> even lowered our price ' to moderately high when we inquired a few days before our stay. </s>
<s> we want to stay south of the river downtown ; we will be back Ok ; I just feel if you 're paying well over $ 200 for a room you should get something to show for it. </s>
<s> location was on Michigan Ave but if I pay just a little more I could have had way better ' Peninsula ; Park Hyatt ; shoot the Omni was 10x better. </s>
<s> ordered a deluxe executive suite ; and it was so below sub par. </s>
<s> room was very small ' so small the ice bucket was in the closet ; the bathroom was just as small ; just well lit ' a plus. </s>
<s> was peeling ; outlets barely covered ; no view. </s>
<s> only thing appealing was the bed ; and that may have been because I was so tired. </s>
<s> we were really excited because this is the Palmer House. </s>
<s> Palmer House does have nice restaurants : the Lockwood ' quiet ; distinguished and the Potter 's Lounge ' grown 'sexy Very disapointed in the service and quality of this hotel. </s>
<s> travel quite frequently to chicago and have never had this happen at any other 4 star hotel. </s>
<s> reserved a king bed. </s>
<s> checkin I was informed they were out of kings and basically offered no type of compensation or upgrade. </s>
<s> i arrived at the room the air conditioner door was open and rattled all night. </s>
<s> TV did not work. </s>
<s> to call for service. </s>
<s> following day returned from work at 6pm and found the room had not even been serviced. </s>
<s> somewhere else. </s>
<s> it ; this hotel seems very nice ; but I was not at all pleased with my stay here. </s>
<s> customer service was horrible. </s>
<s> had to request more towels and washcloths several times before receiving them and my linen had not been replaced either. </s>
<s> as much as I paid to stay here ; you 'd think the least you 'd get is an iron. </s>
<s> ! I had to request an iron ; too ! In addition to all of the failed amenities ; I was mistakenly charged twice for my stay and was n't reimbursed until an entire week later. </s>
<s> next time I choose to visit Chicago ; Swissotel will be the last place I think to stay. </s>
<s> Rock Hotel is a must to visit. </s>
<s> matter what city your in Hard Rock Hotel is the place to stay. </s>
<s> with fun and unique traits to the rooms and dining. </s>
<s> Hotel is the place to be. </s>
<s> views in every location ; especially Chicago. </s>
<s> service is incredible along with the food and decor. </s>
<s> Hotel staff will help you feel right at home ; no BETTER than home : A bunch of us got together and we had a great time in this hotel we asked for limes and they gave us like a punch bowl of them the rooms were so awesome you really have to see it to believe how extradionary this hotel is i love the decorations on every floor and being surrounded by such elegance. </s>
<s> definitely stay here again As a frequent traveler for both business and pleasure ; clean and comfortable accommodations at a reasonable price are important to me. </s>
<s> Suites Chicago provides all of that and more ! The room was spacious and immaculately kept ; with all the tools you could need to prepare a meal in the full-sized kitchen. </s>
<s> a busy work day ; it was wonderful to be able to kick back in front of the huge flat-screen television to relax ; with a spectacular backdrop of the city outside. </s>
<s> will definitely book a room next time in Chicago and I 'll definitely continue to stay at Homewood Suites in other cities. </s>
<s> visited Chicago with my two teenage daughters. </s>
<s> Suites is amazing. </s>
<s> complimentary breakfast and receptions offer so much variety. </s>
<s> hotel was within walking distance to many places to eat and shop. </s>
<s> got caught in a thunderstorm ; and got soaking wet. </s>
<s> dried all our clothes in the dryer right in the hotel ! The Homewood Suites was so much like home. </s>
<s> suite was very spacious and had everything we needed. </s>
<s> hotel had lots of brochures and suggestions for dining and activities. </s>
<s> staff was so friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> is an amazing place and the Homewood Suites is the place to stay. </s>
<s> would definitely stay there again. </s>
<s> husband and I recently chose the Palmer House Hilton for a rare couple 's getaway from our usual life ; and an escape it truly provided. </s>
<s> is something to be said for all the modern amenities combined with an aesthetic drawn from a grander and more luxurious time ; let alone with ever-elusive accessibility for a wheelchair user ! A bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us ; because things like alarm clocks ; hairdryers and ironing boards were already there ; electronic media even available for rent. </s>
<s> a comfortable bed ; control over how the room felt ; no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call ; we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the Chicago culture in close proximity. </s>
<s> often a hotel is an overpriced way to get out of making your own bed in the morning ; but the Hilton was a true vacation. </s>
<s> you. </s>
<s> reading good reviews about I booked a 5 night stay. </s>
<s> in late bit called early in the day to assure we 'd have a roll away as well as the pull out sofa for 2 teens. </s>
<s> somehow had us booked for two rooms instead. </s>
<s> that sorted out and arrived around 10 pm. </s>
<s> in and waited for our luggage . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
Finally went down and got it ourselves. </s>
<s> room was a little grungy ; furniture shabby ; and discovered a suspicious stain on the duvet cover. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> for a new duvet cover which was delivered and unceremoniously handed to me. </s>
<s> it 's kinda gross to have to change the duvet cover in a hotel. </s>
<s> day tried to iron a dress for dinner and the iron did n't work. </s>
<s> for a replacement ; waited a while ; called again and was brought another iron which also did n't work. </s>
<s> time was a charm. </s>

<s> n't be staying here again. </s>
<s> Ambassador East Hotel is a business that certainly strives to keep its customers satisfied. </s>
<s> my entrance at the Ambassador East ; I was greeted warmly. </s>
<s> staff was incredibly pleasant ; and the accommodations were top-knotch. </s>
<s> food served at the award-winning " Pump Room " was to die for ; and the service was fast but friendly. </s>
<s> WIFE AND I STAYED HERE LAST WEEKEND. </s>
<s> WAS OUR HONEYMOON AND IT WAS WONDERFUL. </s>
<s> HOTEL WAS SO BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT. </s>
<s> WERE MORE THAN PLEASED WITH OUR ROOM AND THE RESTURANT WAS AMAZING. </s>
<s> OF THE STAFF HERE WERE VERY NICE AND POLITE. </s>
<s> HELPED US WITH ANY OF OUR NEEDS. </s>
<s> WISH I COULD LIVE IN THIS PLACE. </s>
<s> TOGETHER IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST WEEKENDS OF OUR LIVES. </s>
<s> PLAN ON COMING BACK AGAIN. </s>
<s> HOTEL ! I had a horrible time at Amalfi. </s>
<s> we approached the reception to check it ; we were ignored for about 10 minutes. </s>
<s> ; the lady at the reception was very rude and loud. </s>
<s> room furniture was cheap and looked as if it was n't cleaned recently. </s>
<s> night I found out that my room was located close to a trash incinerator and the noises kept me awake all night. </s>
<s> the manager was not available at night to hear my complaints. </s>
<s> consider my stay total waste money and complete torture. </s>
<s> website wowed me enough to book online although I had never used your hotel. </s>
<s> had high expectations when visiting your hotel with my family on our recent trip to Chicago and I was VERY disappointed. </s>
<s> first problem was that there was not enough staff at the desk. </s>
<s> had to wait a long time to get checked in. </s>
<s> we finally got to the room the beds were unmade and cleaning supplies were in the bathroom. </s>
<s> maid had n't finished the room and she 'd left her stuff behind ! Of course we called the desk right away and got a new room but it was a huge hassle. </s>
<s> next problem was the dog of the person across the hall and down one. </s>
<s> knew this was a pet friendly hotel but we envisioned well controlled ; non barking pets. </s>
<s> animal barked repeatedly when my kids were trying to go to sleep. </s>
<s> called the desk twice and eventually the barking stopped. </s>
<s> think the dog just gave up because it did n't sound like the desk staff knew what to do. </s>
<s> crowning disaster ; at least for my kids and husband ; was that the remote control for the tv was dead. </s>
<s> managed to get that taken care of but it was just the icing on the cake. </s>
<s> hotel looks great but actually being there is not great. </s>
<s> can not recommend it to anyone. </s>
<s> Away ! After generations as an old-world ; cozy and stately ; if a bit tired oasis ; the AE has been purchased by Ian Schrager and taken down so many notches it 's almost not functional. </s>
<s> for the fact that the hotel is under renovation ; the entrance is not handicapped accessible ; and I saw several hotel guests with canes ; casts ; etc ' including myself ; recovering from foot surgery and in a cast ; with a cane struggling with the up and down outside stairs one has to navigate just to get into and out of the hotel. </s>
<s> luggage ; it 's almost impossible. </s>
<s> is simply inexcusable. </s>
<s> 've been a customer of the Ambassador East for decades -- but no more. </s>
<s> hallways are so dark one can barely see. </s>
<s> rooms are stark white ; which in and of itself ; is n't a particular problem ; but it is jarring and almost painful as one 's eyes adjust from the dark hallways. </s>
<s> furniture -- stark and scant -- looks like something from an Ikea closeout. </s>
<s> bed is comfortable -- what a relief -- but only about 15 inches off of the floor ; a real problem if you 're at all physically challenged ; or even elderly and less flexible than you were in your salad days. </s>
<s> problems do n't end there. </s>
<s> room had a horribly uncomfortable wire 'metal desk chair ; and absolutely nowhere else to sit. </s>
<s> arm chair ; no demi-sofa ; no ottoman. </s>
<s> a foot in a cast ; it would have been nice to be able to sit comfortably ; perhaps even with my leg elevated ; while in the room. </s>
<s> way. </s>
<s> bathroom has absolutely nowhere to put any of your toiletries. </s>
<s> a shelf ; a small table ; a nook ; or a medicine cabinet. </s>
<s> you want to put a razor ; shaving cream ; makeup ' for women or anything else down so that you can use them ; you 're sh 't out of luck. </s>
<s> requests for a small table or some sort of chair went unmet. </s>
<s> borrowed umbrella from the front desk was broken and unusable ; something I did n't discover until caught in an expected downpour. </s>
<s> was tempted to throw it out ; but remembered that they would charge me for it if I did n't return it ; in spite of its total lack of usefulness. </s>
<s> -- forget it. </s>
<s> ? For two days in a row ; the housekeeper left several bottles of lotion ; and no shampoo. </s>
<s> service -- not available. </s>
<s> you want breakfast ; the front desk will sell you a small ; pre-wrapped ; commercial grade muffin for $ 4. </s>
<s> -- something you can buy in any gas station for $ 1. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> added value whatsoever. </s>
<s> photos show a nice entrance ; and a large lobby for which the AE has long been famous. </s>
<s> ; that lobby is closed off ; under construction ; and the temporary lobby is on the second floor ; difficult ; again ; for handicapped access. </s>
<s> coffee and water for tea were stone cold ; at 8 in the morning. </s>
<s> confronted with these various misses ; the front desk staff repeatedly shrugged their shoulders and said ; " Yeah ; we know ; you 're not the first to tell us this stuff. </s>
<s> " 
All this shows is that Schrager does n't even care to make an effort to make his guests comfortable ; and that the staff is either too indifferent or too amateur to know the difference and even make an effort to get it right. </s>
<s> 's one thing to get a good price on a hotel room when it 's under renovation. </s>
<s> 's another thing altogether to get screwed in the bargain ; particularly after booking a non-refundable pre-paid reservation. </s>
<s> ; avoid this hotel like the plague. </s>
<s> entering the Hotel Monaco CHicago ; i could see the beauty of a classically elegant building. </s>
<s> old fashioned furnishings ; the wonderful view ; and the polished wood decorating the entore hotel. </s>
<s> first i had been skeptical ; but any doubts i had carried into the hotel were gone. </s>
<s> i entered my room ; the fresh flowers and the amazing Chicago view greeted me. </s>
<s> my stay i enjoyed my free time lounging by the pool ; winding down every night with a comforting massage. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel not only for the pure elegance ; but for the wonderful customer service and the fantastic amenities. </s>
<s> Talbott Hotel claims to be Chicago 's Premiere Small Luxury Hotel. </s>
<s> staying there and experiencing the service ; environment ; and the hotel in general ; I can say with confidence that this just is n't true. </s>
<s> arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and I was immediately disappointed. </s>
<s> one came to my car to collect my bags and I was forced to lug them inside myself. </s>
<s> doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me ; leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags. </s>
<s> inside ; the atmosphere was not what I expected. </s>
<s> lighting was poor ; leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building. </s>
<s> carpet looked dirty ; as if it had n't been vacuumed or washed in quite some time ; and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage. </s>
<s> I arrived at the front desk ; I was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me. </s>
<s> checking in I went up to my room and was once again disappointed. </s>
<s> bed was very uncomfortable and I ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water. </s>
<s> night I ordered room service. </s>
<s> food took 45 minutes to get to my room ; and when it finally arrived it was cold. </s>
<s> fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them. </s>
<s> would certainly not recommend this hotel to any of my friends ; and probably not to my enemies either. </s>
<s> away ! The location of this hotel was excellent as it is just beside the subway and the bus stop for the free trolley bus to Navy Pier is just beside the hotel. </s>
<s> room was very spacious. </s>
<s> of too big for a solo traveler. </s>
<s> view from the room was excellent and it was a great view to sleep at night. </s>
<s> bathroom was spacious too and the room has a big wardrobe. </s>
<s> kitchen has microwave oven and cooking utensils. </s>
<s> of the cooking utensils were a bit dirty ; probably because they had not been used for sometime. </s>
<s> ; the microwave oven was very useful as I can heat up food to eat at night. </s>
<s> can easily walk to the magnificent mile by cutting across the shopping mall across the road. </s>
<s> check out Pizzeria Uno which is near the hotel that serves the delicious deep dish pizza. </s>
<s> cheaper food ; do check out the foodcourt at the shopping mall. </s>
<s> hotel also serves breakfast and dinner from Mon to Thur. </s>
<s> did not find the food that fantastic but it was pretty decent. </s>
<s> will strongly recommend this hotel to everyone going to Chicago. </s>
<s> Hard Rock Hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into Chicago . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
The location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as Lake Michigan ; Millennium Park ; and Art Museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from. </s>
<s> co-works LOVED the exterior of the building ; views from the rooms ; the art on the walls ; and crisp ; clean hip feeling of the hotel ; but not " too over the top " for " business " . </s>
<s> far a better experience than your usual " chain " hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms. </s>
<s> you feel special . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> for the same price. </s>
<s> lobby and bar have fun cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on Michigan Ave ' or catch a real rock star in the lobby ! Swisses Chicago : Nice ; but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the Chicago waterfront. </s>
<s> spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city ; but do n't plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning. </s>
<s> free WiFi here ; or affordable breakfast ; or a free swim in the pool. </s>
<s> a ten-dollar-a-night charge for internet ; an on average $ 25 plate for breakfast ; and another 15 bucks a night for the " fitness center. </s>
<s> " 
I 've stayed in small town no star motels where WiFi is free as part of a 50 dollar room. </s>
<s> with it - this is 2009 ! No free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and do n't need it anyway ; but for those of us who are n't charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated. </s>
<s> ; milk ; OJ ; stale donuts ; ; muffins ; maybe some cereal. </s>
<s> us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby. </s>
<s> regards to swimming ; this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan accordingly. </s>
<s> all makes the $ 6 Fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain. </s>
<s> : Drop the fees ; the nickel dimming of folks ; and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel. </s>
<s> - I had a rather mediocre experience at the Sofitel. </s>
<s> came for a sudden business meeting during the holiday season ; and the Sofitel was the only hotel for miles that was not booked to capacity. </s>
<s> had a very important proposal to submit to my boss the night I was staying there ; but the Wi-Fi was so slow that ; in the end ; I was not able to complete it in time. </s>
<s> complaint is that hotels as expensive as the Sofitel should at least have a decent Wi-Fi connection ! The staff at the James Chicago hotel seemed determined to make my stay a horrible one. </s>
<s> I entered the establishment to check in ; I was ignored. </s>
<s> clerk let half a dozen people in front of me before she even acknowledged me. </s>
<s> room service would be better ; I relaxed in my room while I waited for my food. </s>
<s> the time it reached my room ; it was cold AND the wrong order. </s>
<s> ; I went down to the pool only to find it was closed for maintenance. </s>
<s> the restaurants the hotel recommended were one-star ; and none of my regular channels were on the tv. </s>
<s> in all ; it was a bad stay at the James hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> prepared the hotel is old. </s>
<s> is on the historic list. </s>
<s> is updating to be done no doubt . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
So just be forewarned. </s>
<s> is clean and the staff is phenomenal. </s>
<s> said that ; you can not beat the location. </s>
<s> in the heart of the Gold coast. </s>
<s> a train from O 'hare right into the city. </s>
<s> drops you off only 4 blocks from the hotel. </s>
<s> block from the beach and public transportation is right there. </s>
<s> area to explore. </s>
<s> highly recommend the Ambassador East We have just returned from 4 nights at the Conrad Chicago ; everthing about the hotel was excellent. </s>
<s> room and service from all the staff was first class. </s>
<s> view from our room. </s>
<s> hotels location is great ; right in the centre of the magnificent mile. </s>
<s> wonderful stay in an amazing city was made perfect by our stay at the Conrad. </s>
<s> at the Hard Rock Hotel is one of best bets you can ever make while traveling. </s>
<s> stayed at this one the last time I visited Chicago and it was just wonderful. </s>
<s> rooms are amazing and the one I stayed in had a great view of the city. </s>
<s> beds were comfortable and everything was really clean and neat ; the Wi-Fi was really fast and always available and I liked the fact that you could get a guitar at the front desk and jam in your own room with a pair of headphones. </s>
<s> did n't have the chance to use the spa ; but I could tell it was really nice and relaxing. </s>
<s> did go to the Base Bar a couple times for a drink ; very cool atmosphere and great drinks to choose from. </s>
<s> Rock shop was pretty cool too and I bought a bunch of shirts to bring back home to family and friends. </s>
<s> I think this is one of the coolest hotels you could stay in ; the experience is definitely different than any other hotel I 've stayed in. </s>
<s> Sofitel Water Tower was a wonderful place to stay for my husband and me for our 20th anniversary weekend trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> got married in the city but then moved away ; and it was so romantic to return. </s>
<s> loved how near the Sofitel was to everything - the Magnificent Mile was just outside our door ; and we could walk to Navy Pier and other attractions as well. </s>
<s> has changed ; but the Sofitel made it feel like home again . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  except a very plush and elegant version of home ! We stayed in a Junior Suite ; which had great views of the city ; and room service was very attentive when we called for champagne after midnight the day we arrived. </s>
<s> nights before leaving for supper ; we had a cocktail in Le Bar and enjoyed talking about what we 'd done during the day ; and all the great memories this town has for us. </s>
<s> I have to say we have some new great memories now ; thanks to the Sofitel Water Tower ! I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for a total of three days ; and through out my stay I had a wonderful time. </s>
<s> room was impeccably clean ; as well as the pillows and sheets. </s>
<s> beds were large and extremely comfortable. </s>
<s> staff though ; in my honest opinion ; is what made my stay so pleasant. </s>
<s> the people at the check in ; to the waiters at the restaurant ; I got the best customer service. </s>
<s> hotel was also conveniently located. </s>
<s> was within walking distance to the shopping center. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying at around the area in Chicago. </s>
<s> Rock Chicago - I had gone to Chicago last week to meet some friends. </s>
<s> the purpose of my visit was leisure I had to pick a hotel that was close to Downtown and was suited to a young crowd. </s>
<s> some research ; Hard Rock seemed to meet both the criteria. </s>
<s> had made reservations two months in advance ; so got a decent rate of $ 259 a night 'If you book last minute it will definitely be expensive. </s>
<s> decor of the rooms and the hotel was in line with its theme. </s>
<s> I entered the room there was some towels that were thrown on the floor. </s>
<s> did upset me at first but the staff was very accommodating and gave me a new room immediately and also gave me a compensation of $ 70. </s>
<s> second room and the bathroom was spacious and clean. </s>
<s> was well stocked mini bar . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> however was very expensive like all good hotels. </s>
<s> room service was very prompt. </s>
<s> did n't spend too much time in the room ; but whatever little I did was all in all a good experience. </s>
<s> front desk staff ; the rest of the experience was dreadful. </s>
<s> room service staff have to be among the most poorly trained I have ever encountered. </s>
<s> had to ask FOUR times for the staff not to slam the supply closet ; adjacent to our room ' almost in the room itself. </s>
<s> do these random room checks for the minibar ; as if the entire budget hinged on the sale of a can of $ 9 peanuts. </s>
<s> roomservice is also equipped with walkie-talkies as loud as megaphones. </s>
<s> you like sleeping in on your vacation ; do n't stay here. </s>
<s> ; the hotel was under massive construction ; a detail that was conveniently excluded from the website. </s>
<s> we had to take the elevator with construction workers just about every time we used it. </s>
<s> discount because of the work and noise. </s>
<s> 'd rather sleep in a box in the alley. </s>
<s> disliked the Sofitel so much we changed our week stay to the Grand Hyatt after the first night. </s>
<s> checked into our suite and was blasted by the smell of body odor immediately. </s>
<s> were tired from our flight ; but went downstairs to change rooms. </s>
<s> second suite smelled just as bad ; but stayed anyway. </s>
<s> disliked the hotel lobby ; the staff ; the decorating ; and especially the bed. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; flimsy mattress. </s>
<s> come to Chicago frequently. </s>
<s> have always stayed at the Grand Hyatt and never been disappointed. </s>
<s> just thought we 'd try some place new. </s>
<s> again. </s>
<s> to the Hyatt or Four Season we go ! Palmer House A Hilton Hotel - The Palmer House is a fantastic place to stay in Chicago. </s>
<s> by walking through the front door I was treated to the sight of the beautiful architecture of the hotel lobby. </s>
<s> rooms are all very well furnished and what surprised me the most is the amount of floor space in each room. </s>
<s> other hotel rooms where everything feels condensed and the room feels crowded with all of the furniture ; the rooms at the Palmer House have a lot of floor space to simply spread out and relax. </s>
<s> beds are all extremely soft and each rooms comes with a large flat panel television. </s>
<s> bathrooms are also amazing. </s>
<s> have stayed at numerous fancy hotels before ; but never have I encountered a bathroom so spotless ! I recommend this hotel one hundred percent ! The Palmer House has definitely deserved my repeat business ! swissotel - A friend recommended this hotel to me ; and I decided to give it a try while visiting Chicago. </s>
<s> $ 270 a night ; the room was better than expected. </s>
<s> ended up with one of those corner rooms ; so the shape was somewhat awkward ; but I had no other complaints. </s>
<s> bed was comfy and the bathroom clean. </s>
<s> view was n't all that exciting but that ended up better as the room was quiet. </s>
<s> staff was nice ; and I had a pleasant time. </s>
<s> definitely stay again if in Chicago. </s>
<s> was in Chicago for a convention and stayed at the Sheraton towers. </s>
<s> had a negative experience because I got about one dozen very painful bites by bed bugs on my torso. </s>
<s> made attending the conference uncomfortable. </s>
<s> staff changed the sheets but could not move me to another room ; as the conference had booked the whole hotel. </s>
<s> the sheets were changed ; I got no more bites ; thankfully. </s>
<s> this ; I managed to enjoy the stay. </s>
<s> liked the location next to the river ; and the fact that it was easy to walk to Magnificent Mile. </s>
<s> decided to book at the Amalfi after cancelling a reservation for a different hotel after reading their reviews on TA. </s>
<s> was blown away by the reviews for the Amalfi on TA and decided to check it out. </s>
<s> was able to secure a great price on the hotel room and I was not disappointed. </s>
<s> asked to be put in a quiet room because I was having an interview the next day. </s>
<s> room was very quiet and in a great location ; but my only complaint was that it was right next to the fitness center and I could hear people running on the treadmill during the day. </s>
<s> ; it quieted down at night and I could not hear anything. </s>
<s> rooms were enormous for Chicago and I was pleased ! The hotel provided free breakfast which was good ; free internet ; and free gym access. </s>
<s> hotel is only a few blocks from the Magnificient Mile and I walked there everyday to do shopping. </s>
<s> have to say that the doorman is truly a gem and is very friendly. </s>
<s> wish that their front desk staff were as friendly as he was. </s>
<s> in all ; I plan to stay at the Amalfi anytime I visit Chicago in the future. </s>
<s> - My stay at this hotel was very memorable. </s>
<s> the service was slow at times ; my stay was overall fantastic. </s>
<s> room was very spacious. </s>
<s> had two ; massive queen beds and a large bathroom with a full Jacuzzi that was large enough to sit three people. </s>
<s> the room and the bathroom had dimmable lights so that we could control the atmosphere of the room. </s>
<s> was also impressed with the HD TV at the center of the room and the automatic shades. </s>
<s> location was great. </s>
<s> 's right at the center of downtown Chicago and makes for great access to all that Chicago has to offer. </s>
<s> we did n't try the restaurant at the hotel itself ; there were many excellent food options nearby. </s>
<s> 'd highly recommend Bistro 110 ; which has an excellent steak and is within walking distance of the hotel. </s>
<s> 'd definitely suggest you consider this hotel next time you take your family to Chicago. </s>
<s> vacation was highlighted by a four day stay at Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown. </s>
<s> believed it would be the best part of the trip ; I discovered it was an unfolding nightmare. </s>
<s> in our lovely room on the fifteenth floor ; a voice emanating from the phone ; informed us of the pending fire alarm and what procedures to follow. </s>
<s> above the tenth floor was instructed to go into the bathroom ; wet towels and place them along the bottom of the closed door. </s>
<s> not use the elevators and wait for further instructions. </s>
<s> nervously waited for twenty minutes without any further communications from the voice in the phone. </s>
<s> then decided to exit via the stairs ; realizing too late that once you entered the stairwells ; doors behind you were locked. </s>
<s> continued to travel downward ; against the backdrop music of sirens and loud muffled speakers. </s>
<s> ; we were rescued without any physical injuries ; yet emotionally we were damaged. </s>
<s> now choose my hotels in the range of ten floors or less. </s>
<s> stayed at the James hotel for a 40th birthday. </s>
<s> location was excellent for shopping and restaurants ; but also very loud. </s>
<s> room was horrible. </s>
<s> SMALL. </s>
<s> had a double 'double and it was the size of a college dorm room ; plus completely white walls and linens. </s>
<s> no color except for one accent pillow. </s>
<s> was very sterile and uninviting. </s>
<s> were on the 11th floor and the lobby for the elevator was dark and done in red and balck with minimal lighting. </s>
<s> looked like the entrance to hell ; if not a haunted house. </s>
<s> was very nice and accomodating. </s>
<s> would not return to this hotel. </s>
<s> traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth : eventually the lodging deteriorates. </s>
<s> you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time ! I have been staying at the Talbott for several decades. </s>
<s> ; changes have been made ; like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance ; most recently. </s>
<s> other things have gone downhill. </s>
<s> the last several stays I have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service. </s>
<s> have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions. </s>
<s> is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of The Talbott ; but not this less-than-maintained lodging. </s>
<s> ; personally ; am shopping for a new home away from home. </s>
<s> was an intern at Boeing 's Chicago office and got placed in this hotel for a while ; since there was no more corporate housing in the city. </s>
<s> was really awesome staying in a Hilton for almost a month ! The breakfast bar was huge. </s>
<s> was dissapointed that there was no oven in my room so I could n't prepare anything. </s>
<s> the decor was really nice ; and the bed was incredibly fluffy. </s>
<s> stayed at this hotel for a conference. </s>
<s> lobby and the conference areas were immaculate. </s>
<s> restaurants ' one of which was Shula 's Steakhouse and bars were great. </s>
<s> saff was exteremely helpful. </s>
<s> rooms left a lot to be desired . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> Our nonsmoking room smelled of smoke. </s>
<s> A 'C system was ancient and tempermental ; and the bathroom was old and in need of a makeover. </s>
<s> was surprising to see since the physical plant was so nice. </s>
<s> would choose ; however ; to stay elsewhere. </s>
<s> for the money we paid. </s>
<s> Hotel Chicago - The website makes it look better than it actually is. </s>
<s> n't get fooled by the pictures ; the rooms are small and dark. </s>
<s> paid $ 300 for a corner room with a " view " and all we could see were buildings and dumpsters. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> I think there was some mold in our bathroom ; around the base of the tub. </s>
<s> are many other great hotels in Chicago ' Hotel Sax ; the Palmer House Hilton ; I will not be returning here. </s>
<s> stayed there on October 6 ; 2012. </s>
<s> I pulled the covers of my bed ; there was a small dark brown insect the size of a grain of rice ; which was either a bed bug or cockroach. </s>
<s> trapped it under a glass ' see the attached pictures and called the front desk. </s>
<s> housecleaning person claimed it was a cockroach. </s>
<s> horrible service by the hotel management to respond to the problem ; failing to follow through on promises they made to me. </s>
<s> aside the bug problem ; I caution that the windows are quite thin. </s>
<s> could hear a lot of the street noise ; which made for a hard night 's sleep ; not to mention worrying about insects even after changing rooms. </s>
<s> $ 400 a night after tax ; I strongly encourage you to check for alternatives. </s>
<s> Chicago - While I have been impressed with other branches of this hotel ; this one is lacking in many areas. </s>
<s> front staff was somewhat incompetent. </s>
<s> rooms were tidy and cleaning was not up to the mark ; the TV was non operational ; shower arm was rusty and the breakfast service was slow. </s>
<s> this is a 4. </s>
<s> star hotel ; it really did n't live up to the expectations. </s>
<s> only good part was that the hotel was in the middle of great sight seeing locations. </s>
<s> ; Definitely would not recommend anyone staying here considering there are many other good hotels around this area. </s>
<s> Amalfi Hotel Chicago portrayed itself to be a luxurious comfortable place to stay. </s>
<s> arriving at the hotel my party and I had over a 20 minute wait just to check in. </s>
<s> were treated like cattle once we were able to check in at their " private " counter that their website highlights. </s>
<s> felt as though I was sitting with a bank teller rather than checking in. </s>
<s> only did the wait and process take seemingly forever ; but our reservations were completely wrong. </s>
<s> ended up having to settle for a double non-smoking room when I had reserved a smoking king room. </s>
<s> having the room I requested and was assured was available is completely unacceptable for the high prices of this supposedly high end luxurious hotel. </s>
<s> was not compensated for having to switch rooms and Audrey our Experience Designer was no help at all even when we called down upon entering the room which smelled of urine and stale booze. </s>
<s> recommend saving a handful of money and checking into a chain hotel in the area. </s>
<s> Amalfi Hotel Chicago is a waste of time and money as far as I am concerned especially when I could stay at a cheaper chain hotel and get better treatment and comfort. </s>
<s> n't waist your time staying here. </s>
<s> House A Hilton Hotel - I stayed at the Palmer House on March 16th when I was in town for a business trip. </s>

<s>  everything you could ask for. </s>
<s> is easy walk to Magnificient Mile and lots of great restaurants. </s>
<s> is friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> cab ride to Loop. </s>
<s> absolutely loved the Knickerbocker. </s>
<s> ; if you expect your hotels to be cookie cutter comfortable ; forget this place. </s>
<s> Holiday Inns are like the rows of housing developments in the suburbs ; the Knickerbocker is like those beautiful old houses in the center of the city. </s>
<s> location is great ; the hotel bar is cozy and classy ; and the rooms feel like guest bedrooms in Victorian mansions. </s>
<s> the price ; you simply ca n't do any better than this in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> stay at Hilton for 4 nights last march. </s>
<s> was a pleasant stay. </s>
<s> got a large room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms ; The TV was Ok ; a 27 CRT Flat Screen. </s>
<s> coincierge was very friendly when we need. </s>

<s> : Low rate price ; huge rooms ; close to attractions at Loop ; close to metro station. </s>
<s> : Expensive breakfast ; Internet access charged. </s>
<s> : When leaving the building ; always use the Michigan Av exit. </s>
<s> a great view. </s>
<s> stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was by far the worst hotel stay I ever had. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel to anyone. </s>
<s> promised I would be able to relax in the spa area and it was dirty and not relaxing at all. </s>
<s> I got to my room I ordered room service and it took them 45 minutes to bring what I ordered. </s>
<s> am highly dissatisfied. </s>
<s> stay at The Palmer House Hilton was wonderful. </s>
<s> was attracted to this Hotel because it was going to be me and my finance 's first time in Chicago. </s>
<s> location of the hotel was perfectly placed Downtown Chicago We took advantage of the Hilton Bed and Breakfast Special. </s>
<s> Check in on Friday afternoon we went to the Lockwood restaurant before going to the room for the weekend. </s>
<s> stayed in a One Bedroom Suite with a King Size Bed. </s>
<s> Hotel was spotless. </s>
<s> have never been in a Hotel Room that was so clean. </s>
<s> portions of food was perfect ; and everything they provided was on point. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel for anyone who is going to visit Chicago for the first time. </s>
<s> staff is professional ; and let you feel like a King and Queen. </s>
<s> Chicago Water Tower - Our stay at Sofitel was OK at best. </s>
<s> room was well furnished but small ; and the bathroom felt a little cramped as well. </s>
<s> the bed was almost uncomfortable. </s>
<s> liked the location a lot as it was convenient but for the money we paid we really expected more. </s>
<s> ; would not recommend. </s>
<s> are better off spending your money somewhere else. </s>
<s> have stayed here several times and have always found it to be clean with comfortable beds. </s>
<s> were given a choice of breakfast or free cocktails which we thought was a nice touch. </s>
<s> room was small but adequate. </s>
<s> was great ; close to the L trains and also close to the train station as we always " walk " from Union Station. </s>
<s> - If you especially love testing your patience ; then wait no longer ; this hotel is the one for you. </s>
<s> particularly enjoyed the lack of service. </s>
<s> ordered a filet mignon and it took them 2 hours to call me back and tell me that they are out of filet mignon. </s>
<s> then I ordered their salmon ; it was cold on the inside and it took another hour before I could enjoy my dinner. </s>
<s> got to admit the room is actually pretty nice but it would have been nicer if I got paid by the hotel for being my own housekeeper. </s>
<s> housekeeping never showed that one night and it makes me wonder if all the other 5 star reviews are actually fake. </s>
<s> a night of distress ; I wanted to enjoy a bubble bath. </s>
<s> am a sucker for a nice bubble bath so I was going to forgive them after my bath but to my great surprise ; I was n't able to enjoy one. </s>
<s> kept on leaking out of the tub and down to the drain even after trying hard to fit in the bath plug in many different orientations. </s>
<s> hotel has a very special place in my heart : when someone I loathe asks me for a recommendation ; this hotel will never fail to disappoint. </s>
<s> at the Fitzpatrick before ; about 4 years ago ; it was ok. </s>
<s> management was great ; staff was so kind ; and rooms were clean. </s>
<s> But this time I promised my self NEVER to go back ! The new staff was so rude ! I made a reservation for my Anniversary on the internet ; and the day of check in I was told by the hotel staff that they do not have my reservation ! 1 I was transferred around back and forth from the hotel staff to the reservations hotline. </s>
<s> Staff was extremely rude ! Not arrogant ; but rude ! Like they hated thier job. </s>
<s> They offered check in at 1pm but the room was n't ready till 3pm ! 4 There were stains everywhere ! 5 Because of the high sales of rooms due to popularity on this site ; they must have hired a cheap unfriendly staff. </s>
<s> Stay at Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was wonderful ; i stayed in the traditional guest room and i slept good ; i was able to get to my meeting well rested ; thank you Sheraton ! - Bobby When you stay at a hotel like The James ; just from their price point ; you expect a certain level of quality. </s>
<s> I pay well over 500 dollars for a room ; I do not think it unreasonable to expect not only a quality room ; but also a certain level of standard of service. </s>
<s> this hotel should rename itself The Lebron James ; because it has about as much class as he does ; and is about twice as pretentious. </s>
<s> handful of baby powder thrown into my face would have been a refreshing break from the level of service I received at The Lebron James. </s>
<s> night of hell began with the clerk ; bellboy ; or whatever he was ; at the front desk ; who faked what I assume was intended to be a British accent ; but ended up as an unholy melding of Australian and New Englander. </s>
<s> British accent does not make you fancy ; or skilled. </s>
<s> I made my way past Mr. </s>
<s> Belvedere and to my room ; I was disappointed ; not only by its size ; which was unusually small ; but also a faint scent of cigarettes. </s>
<s> a strong one ; but I could definitely smell smoke. </s>
<s> acceptable. </s>
<s> ; while I was sleeping ; a deep throbbing sound began to emanate from the walls. </s>
<s> sounded technical ; mechanical ; like an air conditiner malfunctioning. </s>
<s> many reassurances from the front desk ; the throbbing continued on throughout the night. </s>
<s> demanded the man at the front desk come up and rectify the situation immediately ; but from what I could tell ; he never came. </s>
<s> wife and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago and enjoyed everything about the Hotel. </s>
<s> importantly our room was perfect with plenty of space ; great jazz CD 's in the room ; wonderful bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds I 've ever slept in. </s>

<s> Amalfi offers a great continential breakfast on every floor each morning with good coffee and a great selection of pastry 's ; fruit 's and jucie 's. </s>
<s> also enjoyed the managers receptions one evening where they offer a great choice of complementary cocktails and antipasta 's for their guests. </s>
<s> highly recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> and my wife recently stayed at the Hilton Chicago while on vacation ; and I ca n't recommend it enough. </s>
<s> hotel is located right on Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago ; and right next to tons of great restaurants and stores. </s>
<s> rooms are spacious and elegant ; they are modern and stylish without being crazy or garish. </s>
<s> especially liked the big flat screen TV and the very comfy bed ; sleeping in hotel rooms is often far from relaxing but I had no problem falling asleep. </s>
<s> highly recommend the Hilton Chicago ; I 'll definitely stay there again. </s>
<s> Our trip to Chicago was a complete delight despite our stay at the Affinia Hotel. </s>
<s> their rates were actually higher than we were used to in New York City ; we naturally assumed we would get a nicer establishment. </s>
<s> could not have been more wrong. </s>
<s> place focuses on gimmicks to set themselves apart from their competition. </s>
<s> ; it does set them apart but in a strictly negative way. </s>
<s> the " Dream Pillow Menu " and the " Experience Kit " were a complete flop. </s>
<s> the " Dream Pillow Menu " ; the hotel offered patrons what seemed to be great pillow choices from down-stuffed to hypoallergenic selections. </s>
<s> happily chose the fluffy down pillows but when we got to our room and laid down on them a giant poof of dust came out. </s>
<s> first ; I thought it was my imagination so I stood up and hit the pillows on the edge of the bed. </s>
<s> dust came out them ! Particles were flying around the room ; I 'm now sneezing and there was this disgusting grit all over my sunglasses that were sitting on the night stand. </s>
<s> called the desk and they sent up replacements for all the pillows. </s>
<s> pillows were some kind of " music pillow " that pluged into an mp3 player. </s>
<s> was sleeping on uncomfortable cords all night. </s>
<s> general ; the staff was pleasant and tried to be accommodating ; but there was just no apology good enough for filthy pillows. </s>
<s> failed gimmick they offered was the " Experience Kits " . </s>
<s> were given ' ours to keep a collection of some maps ' which were actually very nice ; a walking tour guide that was all marked up ; and a handy deck of cards opened and missing two cards. </s>
<s> this place lacked attention to detail ; that is one thing ; but it lacked any attention at all. </s>
<s> the pillows were n't already enough ; at this point I was certain that I would never stay at this establishment again. </s>
<s> ; do n't walk away from this place. </s>

<s> was not annoying decor by any means. </s>
<s> in was painless and the service was great ! Heard NO noise whatsoever . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the reports of " thin walls " are greatly exaggerated. </s>

<s> was a Beatles picture in the bathroom and Gene Simmons was embedded in the mirror ! The view is amazing and the hotel is located in the middle of downtown Chicago so its close to anything you would want to do. </s>
<s> do have one complaint : the walls are thin and things can get kind of noisy . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but I guess that 's to be expected when you stay at a hotel that revolves around music ! My stay at the Ambassador East was great ! The hotel is in a great location in the charming Gold Coast neighborhood of downtown Chicago. </s>

<s> room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested ; the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound ; and we only had a stock of 2 towels ; which were never replaced during our stay. </s>
<s> made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel. </s>
<s> was a huge disappointment ; for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl. </s>
<s> highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel. </s>

<s> noticed here others on this site have lost stuff from this hotel. </s>
<s> know that this is always a possibility but really did not expect it at a hotel like this. </s>
<s> ; Chicago exceeded my expectations but the intercontinental did not. </s>
<s> else where. </s>
<s> Rock Hotel - The Hard Rock is incredible ; probably the best hotel I 've ever stayed in. </s>
<s> concierge was amazing ; they gave me a complimentary upgrade to a ' Platinum King room from the standard room reservation that I had made right when I arrived. </s>
<s> room was huge and featured a beautiful king size bed right in the middle. </s>
<s> was a great big office desk off in the corner of the room and a very comfortable chair along with it - perfect for the little bit of work I brought with me. </s>

<s> decided to spend the extra money booking a room at the Monaco because of the website 's pictures of the beautiful rooms and views. </s>
<s> was a waste of cash ; to say the least. </s>
<s> I had requested a room with a view of the city ; they must have given me the worst room in the place. </s>
<s> service skipped over my room on my second day there ; and I had to call for towels at least twice before someone finally came to my room. </s>

<s> was quick and the girl at the reception was very nice and helpful in responding to my questions about nearby restaurants. </s>
<s> location of the hotel is excellent ; right at the Magnificent Miles and in the middle of many boutiques ; which let me do a lot of shopping. </s>

<s> room was on the top of the building so I got a very nice view of the Chicago downtown. </s>
<s> room service was very satisfiable : the night I arrived the hotel ; it was quite late ; but when I ordered a meal ; my call was answered politely and my order came very quickly. </s>

<s> the mornings ; the provided breakfast was buffet-style and there were plenty of selections. </s>
<s> slept very well on all nights so I was always full of energy during the daytime to tour the city. </s>
<s> will stay in this hotel again the next time I come to Chicago. </s>
<s> stayed in the IC chicago for 6 nights from 26th Dec after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. </s>
<s> werent disappointed. </s>
<s> had 2 rooms opposite each other in the Historic tower. </s>
<s> rooms were spacious and very clean with good views towards the river and tribune building. </s>
<s> got a good rate on the rooms but did not have breakfast in the hotel as it was very expensive as was the Wifi at $ 17 per day. </s>

<s> Chicago Hyatt Regency deceptively alters the cancellation policy by charging the full room rate upon cancellation -- ie the room can not be cancelled. </s>
<s> recently booked over the phone a one night stay directly with the hotel. </s>
<s> reservation specialist mentioned over the phone there was a 72-hour cancellation policy. </s>
<s> ; when I tried to cancel the reservation within that timeframe ; Robert ; the reservation supervisor ; said that the room could not be cancelled at any time without charging full price for the room. </s>
<s> said that I should refer to the confirmation e-mail that states at the bottom that prepayment is required at time of booking non-refunable. </s>
<s> clearly was not what was agreed to over the phone. </s>
<s> told him to cancel without being charged. </s>
<s> response ; he threatened to cancel and charge me for the full stay. </s>
<s> would someone cancel if they are going to be charged full price ? The bottom line is the hotel deceptively changed the terms of the agreement ; and Robert should go back to customer service school ! My wife and I spent our honeymoon in Chicago this summer. </s>
<s> this time we stayed that the Hotel Allegro. </s>
<s> knew this would be a positive experience from day one when I actually booked our reservations ; the staff was very knowledgeable and courteous ; and the whole process was quick ; easy ; and painless. </s>

<s> Stars and Two Thumbs Up. </s>
<s> you 're looking for an elegant hotel in downtown Chicago ; you have to stay here. </s>
<s> Ambassador East Hotel has very comfortable and beautiful large rooms and is like a home away from home. </s>
<s> perfect place for a business person ; and if you have a small pet you can bring them too ! I would give this place four stars and would definitely stay here again. </s>
<s> let me say wonderful ! My wife and i were refered this Hotel by a friend. </s>

When my husband and I went to Amalfi Hotel we were expecting first class service. </s>
<s> ; when we got there we learned they had given our room to another guest and we were not able to get a suite like we had booked. </s>
<s> service took forever and the food was subpar. </s>
<s> they had planners to help explore the area ; but we requested one and never saw hide nor hair of a planner. </s>
<s> spa staff seemed incompetent. </s>
<s> only positive things I can say about Amalfi Hotel was that the rooms were stylish as advertised. </s>
<s> give this hotel two stars. </s>
<s> Hotel Allegro in Chicago is understated luxury. </s>
<s> love the minimalist decor ; and the linens were quality and exquisite. </s>
<s> ca n't beat the location ; either ; it 's located in the heart of the theatre district. </s>
<s> distance to all the great restaurants in Chicago ! They also offer an in-room spa service ; which is pure decadence. </s>
<s> chose to indulge in the Eucalyptus Mani 'pedi. </s>
<s> was by far the priciest manicure and pedicure I have had in my life ' 135 dollars but it was a wonderful experience. </s>
<s> eucalyptus treatments left my hands and feet feeling so soft yet refreshed at the same time. </s>
<s> highly recommend this hotel if you want to experience the finer thingsthis gorgeous city has to offer. </s>
<s> was very disappointed with this hotel. </s>
<s> front desk clerk was rude ; she was on a personal call and took 10 mins. </s>
<s> to get off the phone. </s>
<s> I arrived in the room the bed was n't made from the last guest and all the towels were dirty. </s>
<s> called down to the front desk and she made me come back down from the twelveth floor for a new room assignment 'on the twelveth floor. </s>
<s> downstairs the clerk treated me as though I had done something wrong. </s>
<s> I arrived in the new room I found the bathroom less than clean . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
There was hair all over the floor ; toilet and shower. </s>
<s> shower curtain was mildewed and dried toothpaste spit on the mirror. </s>
<s> allergies started to bother me ; immediately upon entering the room ; so I checked the filter in the air conditioner. </s>
<s> looked like it had never been cleaned. </s>
<s> comforter was stained and the carpet looked like it never saw a vacuum. </s>
<s> waiting on acceptable room I went to dinner. </s>
<s> proved to be as bad as the rooms. </s>
<s> lettuce in my salad was brown and slimmy. </s>
<s> steak was rare and I asked for medium. </s>
<s> to mention ; it tasted like rotten meat. </s>
<s> veggies looked like they had been cooked a week earlier and the potato was shriveled and dry. </s>
<s> top the whole experience off . </s>

<s> 
When I went to turn on the lamp in my final room it electrocuted and the ambulance had to come get me for a 2 day hospital stay. </s>
<s> was really excited to be visiting Chicago for the first time ; and the hotel that was recommended to me was the Conrad Chicago ; located on Rush Street. </s>
<s> wanted a hotel that was conveniently located to all the downtown sites ; and the Conrad Chicago does not disappoint in that respect. </s>
<s> ; everything else about this hotel could be classified as sub-par ; ranging from the rudeness of the check-in clerks to the roaches that were freely roaming in my room. </s>
<s> hotel does not deserve to be on anyone 's recommended list. </s>
<s> first problem was a rude desk clerk who checked me in. </s>
<s> asking for three forms of identification ' most places only ask for a driver 's license and asking me twenty questions about the reason for my trip to Chicago ; she reluctantly gave me a room key. </s>
<s> asked if there was a bell cap to help me with my bags and she said if I wanted to wait ; one would be able to help in about 15 minutes. </s>
<s> did n't feel like waiting ; so I dragged my bags to the room ; only to find that the room key did not work ! Instead of dragging everything back down ; I decided to use my cell phone to call the front desk ; only there was no cell phone signal in the hall way. </s>
<s> could n't believe I was in the middle of downtown Chicago and the hotel did not have a signal ! I finally flagged down someone from the housekeeping staff to let me into my room ; but I immediately saw there were problems. </s>
<s> roaches scampered across the carpet and when I went into the bathroom ; there were no towels or wash cloths. </s>
<s> went to turn on the TV and it did n't work. </s>
<s> of the lamps was missing a light bulb. </s>
<s> could n't believe that this was happening to me. </s>
<s> was at the Conrad Chicago ; not the Motel Six ! I then sat down on the bed and the mattress was soft and lumpy. </s>
<s> was ready to cry. </s>
<s> was spending a lot of money on this hotel and it was a dump. </s>
<s> called down to the front desk and asked for another room ; but they refused ; saying I had gotten a special rate and it did not allow room changes. </s>
<s> insisted that they give me towels ; fix the TV ; put a light bulb in the lamp and have someone spray to get rid of the roaches. </s>
<s> agreed ; but told me it would take " awhile " because several of their key personnel had called in sick. </s>
<s> stay at the Conrad Chicago was a nightmare from beginning to end. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel to anyone My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel last month for my son 's wedding. </s>
<s> we got there nobody helped us with our bags and they took forever to Valet our car. </s>
<s> waiting 15 minutes to get my car parked he expected a tip ; which I found rude. </s>
<s> finally getting to our room I noticed crumbs on the floor and a dirty bathroom. </s>
<s> was extremely disappointed with the room and the service. </s>
<s> will not recommend this place to anyone. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed here for a short get-away weekend and loved it. </s>
<s> is so conveniently located close to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> staff was very helpful and the room was great. </s>
<s> was definitely worth every penny ! I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. </s>
<s> stayed for four nights while attending a conference. </s>
<s> hotel is in a great spot - easy walk to Michigan Ave shopping or Rush St. </s>
<s> ; but just off the busy streets. </s>
<s> room I had was spacious ; and very well-appointed. </s>
<s> staff was friendly ; and the fitness center ; while not huge ; was well-equipped and clean. </s>
<s> 've stayed at a number of hotels in Chicago ; and this one is my favorite. </s>
<s> was n't free ; but at $ 10 for 24 hours is cheaper than most business hotels ; and it worked very well. </s>
<s> wanted a nice place to stay the night after dinner ; theater ; and my daughter 's 21st birthday. </s>
<s> place certainly fit the bill. </s>
<s> was convenient to everything including the SouthShore Railroad station. </s>
<s> staff were all friendly. </s>
<s> was a small wine reception in the lobby in the evening and Starbucks coffee in the morning. </s>
<s> ; the concierge ; ordered flowers for my daughter and had a nice bowl of Hershey Kisses waiting for us when we arrived. </s>

<s>  </s>

<s> 
Only flaw was breakfast was pricey and service was very very slow '2hours for four kids and four adults on a friday morning even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant. </s>
<s> was very good so it was worth the wait. </s>
<s> would return in a heartbeat. </s>

<s> 
We booked our stay through Priceline. </s>
<s> and got a great deal. </s>
<s> were only staying one night and we had our 2 year old with us. </s>
<s> check-in ; we were upgraded to a suite with a lake view of Lake Michigan. </s>
<s> was beautiful. </s>
<s> suite had a king bed with a living room and a bar and mini-fridge which we did n't need ; but if we were staying longer ; it would have been a godsend. </s>
<s> hotel is in close proximity with Grant Park which has the beautiful Buckingham Fountain. </s>
<s> walked around the park and even saw a movie being filmed . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but if you are looking for a hotel with a lot of restaurants around it ; this is n't the one. </s>
<s> ended up eating at the Irish Pub inside the hotel ' Kitty O 'Shea 's which has great food. </s>
<s> We have stayed here before and always end up eating here. </s>
<s> '
There are a lot of attractions within a mile including the Field Museum ; Shedd Aquarium ; Soldier Field ; and Navy Pier. </s>
<s> may not be walking distance but we could see them from our hotel window. </s>
<s> ; we had another wonderful stay at the Chicago Hilton. </s>
<s> Our 4th stay The only downside is the expensive parking within the hotel . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 41 dollars a night is kind of ridiculous. </s>
<s> think the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is a upscale place. </s>
<s> had my wedding there and it was the best of the best. </s>
<s> staff was so helpful and made me feel confident that my wedding would be a success. </s>
<s> chef prepared a lavish sit down dinner with appetizers and desserts. </s>
<s> also had a wonderful pastry chef who baked my wedding cake. </s>
<s> tables were decorated in very good taste and could not be more perfect. </s>
<s> bar was also set up the way I wanted it and even had a champagne fountain. </s>
<s> guests had a wonderful experience with their stay at the hotel and felt pampered. </s>
<s> rooms were like suites with a mini bar. </s>
<s> had terry cloth bathrobes in each bathroom. </s>
<s> you are looking to have a wedding in the Chicago area look into having it here you will not be disappointed ! I went to Chicago and We made a reservation to Hotel Monaco Chicago which is a Kimpton Hotel ; and I decided to stay in a tranquility suite. </s>
<s> was amazing I went with my family and all of us had a comfortable space. </s>
<s> Service Was great served quickly and the cleaners clean quick. </s>
<s> thing was that it was pet friendly which I thought was cool meaning you could bring your dogs. </s>
<s> hotel was amazing and beutiful. </s>
<s> House A Hilton Hotel Me and my family visited Chicago last month and we had decided to stay at the Palmer House after reading the online reviews. </s>
<s> stayed in a guest room with two double beds. </s>
<s> room was big and spacious ; the bed and the bed sheets were soft and comfortable. </s>
<s> bathrooms were also clean and all the necessary amenities were available for us to enjoy. </s>
<s> dining at the hotel the Lockwood was very exotic and had a wonderful ambience ; but we did not like the food they served. </s>
<s> preferred trying out various places like the Alinea and the Odyssey which we felt were much better. </s>
<s> Palmer house is a wonderful place to stay in Chicago except that we would suggest trying out other places around to dine rather than depending only on their own dining places. </s>
<s> Fairmount Chigaco-I stayed the Fairmount Chicago for my sister 's wedding over Memorial Day weekend and it was wonderful ! The rooms were quite spacious and had a beautiful view of the river and the city skyline. </s>
<s> hotel is close to the Magnificent Mile ; so I could get all my shopping in. </s>
<s> best part is ; the Fairmont helped me arrange for child-care for my 3-year-old son ; who would have been quite disruptive to the ceremony. </s>
<s> time I stay in Chicago ; I 'll be staying at the Fairmont. </s>
<s> hotel in the heart of Chicago. </s>
<s> room we stayed in had a great view of Lake Michigan. </s>
<s> went in July for a vacation and everything is easily accesible from the hotel. </s>
<s> major attractions are in around the Loop area. </s>
<s> also got a great deal on the price. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago - its in the right spot for both business and pleasure. </s>
<s> - I stayed at the Fairmont for a couple of days. </s>
<s> was a bad experience which started with a long wait for check in. </s>
<s> unfriendly behavior of the staff did not make things better. </s>
<s> got the room on the tenth floor. </s>
<s> the room had a good view ; the room and bathroom were too small in size and definitely not worth the money. </s>
<s> bathroom was not as clean as expected. </s>
<s> sushi in the Sushi Club is over hyped. </s>
<s> would recommend against staying at this hotel. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel ; and it was one of the absolute worse travel experiences that I ever had. </s>
<s> of the main reasons why I had originally booked my stay at the Fairmont was because the property offered special ; " pure " rooms and suites that are supposed to be hypoallergenic. </s>
<s> I suffer from extreme allergies -- and I really hate the thought of a less-than-pristine hotel room -- I was happy to pay extra for a room that was supposed to be specially designed for guests with environmental sensitivities. </s>
<s> 'll tell you this right now -- save your money. </s>
<s> I got to my room ; I immediately detected the distinct smells of cigarette smoke and mold. </s>
<s> add to the gross factor ; I took a look around and noticed dust on the lamps and light fixtures as well as dirt on the carpet. </s>
<s> comforter on the bed looked messy as well -- as if someone had recently used the bed and then hastily threw the comforter back over it. </s>
<s> was no way I was going to stay in this room ; so I made my way back to the check-in desk and politely informed them of the problems with my room. </s>
<s> woman at the front desk told me there were no other rooms available and it was only after we practically got into a yelling match that she grudgingly started typing away at her computer. </s>
<s> making me wait for another twenty minutes ; she finally informed me that they could put me in another room ; but it would be a four hour wait. </s>
<s> hours ! It was absolutely ridiculous. </s>
<s> hotel -- much less one that constantly touts some sort of promise of superior customer service -- should ever treat any of its customers this way. </s>
<s> do not recommend the Fairmont nor will I ever stay there again. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Swissotel Chicago with my husband and two children. </s>
<s> the room was comfortable ; I did not think that it was the best choice of hotel for those with children. </s>
<s> main reason for this was the dining. </s>
<s> the in house restaurants had children 's options ; there were not any other dining options that were a bit more informal. </s>
<s> with children knows that you do n't want to take them to a sit down restaurant at certain times. </s>
<s> was especially true since we were traveling. </s>
<s> arrived at the hotel with tired children in hand and wanted to eat a quick meal and then put them to bed. </s>
<s> ; our only real options on location were these fancy restaurants. </s>
<s> was certainly not the most family friendly of options for a hotel with a kid friendly package. </s>
<s> first walk into the beautifully decorated lobby of the Affinia Chicago hotel where I 'm greeted by name by the concierge. </s>
<s> tells me that they have taken the liberty of customizing the room to my profile from when I booked the stay. </s>
<s> shows me to my room ' paying careful attention to my bags ; and ensuring that I need n't lift a finger sure enough ; the down pillow I had selcted from the dream pillow menu sits proudly atop the queen of the domain ; which by the way is covered with the softest of bedspreads making me wonder if they did n't literally drag a cloud in here and fit it on my bed. </s>
<s> notice that there 's a display of champagne and cupcakes ! atop the dresser and my " experience kit " which comes complete with an ipod shuffle downloaded with only my favorite workout tracks ; and a yoga mat. </s>
<s> namaste. </s>
<s> to resist the urge to inspect the bathroom ; I find that not only is there a marble tiled invisible glass shower ; but a jacuzzi ; lined with candles of vanilla ; deep enough to bathe a walrus. </s>
<s> girlish ; I run the water and test before going to dinner. </s>
<s> Hotel 's restraunt C-house offers the most delicious seafood menu that makes you think you 're dining with the kings of paradise. </s>
<s> at least eating in the Caribbean itself. </s>
<s> ; I should have brought a date. </s>
<s> actually booked this reservation with the hotel over the phone and got a great rate -- much lower than the usual price ! It was a lovely hotel ; beautifully appointed ; walking distance from the places we wanted to go. </s>
<s> would highly recommend the Fairmont. </s>
<s> Hard Rock Hotel Chicago has become my favorite hotel. </s>
<s> 've stayed there at least 5 times now and have never had anything other than a wonderful experience. </s>
<s> you might have guessed - it has a super Rock Roll theme ; with some music paraphanelia in the lobby and on each floor 's elevator lobby. </s>
<s> rooms all have large photo murals that are themed to different musicians. </s>
<s> can request being on the floor of your favorite band ' like KISS ; Aerosmith ; etc . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> '
The rooms are GREAT. </s>
<s> appointed. </s>
<s> Comfortable beds and luxurious sheets and wonderous pillows. </s>
<s> large TV has a cool sound system that ramps up the viewing experience. </s>
<s> 's a spacious desk in each room with a mini bar. </s>
<s> 've always had a room with big windows and a view down Michigan Ave ' the hotel sits right on Michigan - a block from the canal. </s>
<s> bathrooms are furnished with absolutely great fixtures sporting a great design . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  some of the showers have windows in side of them ' you can shower AND enjoy the view down Michigan ! or close the waterproof drapes. </s>
<s> 've never had anything but a great experience with the staff here . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  front desk ; doorman ; etc are all great. </s>
<s> 's a lobby bar that still feels intimate and has nice energy. </s>
<s> screen TV to catch the latest scores ; too. </s>
<s> course ; Rock Roll music pumps thru the place. </s>
<s> can stay at a " plain " hotel anywhere . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  but this is a GREAT ; WELL DESIGNED ; FUN and MEMORABLE HOTEL that you 'll want to return back to. </s>
<s> I had one concern - it would be the rather crazy charge for parking your car overnight. </s>
<s> daily car parking rate was close to $ 50 per night ; which I 'm sorry to say is about the going rate in the loop. </s>
<s> here. </s>
<s> cool. </s>
<s> wife and I recently stayed at the Allegro hotel in Chicago and were extremely disappointed. </s>
<s> claims to be a luxury hotel ; but the air conditioning in our unit was n't working and the ice maker in refridgerator was unbearably slow. </s>
<s> phoned in these issues to the front desk and the person on the other end assured us these problems would be taken care of. </s>
<s> ever showed up. </s>
<s> from that ; there were so many kids running around we could n't think straight. </s>
<s> is just my two cents ; but I 'd would tell anyone considering staying at the Allegro to pass and look at their other options. </s>
<s> had a reservation for 3 rooms with 5 adults and 2 kids ; got only 2 rooms on arrival. </s>
<s> of the corner rooms with an extra room. </s>
<s> the night it was very cold and we were not able to change the a. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; even though we switched it off ; it went on cooling ; strange ! At night it was very loud from the street. </s>
<s> the morning they uploaded something infront of our window and I stood vertically in the bed ; not what you need ; if you only spend 1 night in a hotel. </s>
<s> came here a few years ago and had it better in mind. </s>
<s> area is in good walking distance to all famous shopping places ; very good. </s>
<s> and fancy. </s>
<s> ; but next time we 'll be looking for a more quiet hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> chicago - It was not really worth it. </s>

<s> ; I ca n't say this hotel was a great choice ; there are many others to choose from in the downtown area. </s>
<s> was initially very excited to be staying at the Ambassador East hotel. </s>
<s> photos online appeared very classy and upscale and I thought staying there would be a pleasant experience. </s>
<s> arrival I was very disappointed - the main lobby was closed for construction making it somewhat difficult to get around. </s>
<s> room was very dated - old furnishings and linens ; damaged tile - it fell quite short for the high price we paid. </s>
<s> is an older building with very thin walls allowing you to clearly hear all other guests in surrounding rooms and also the lovely slam of doors of departing guests in the morning. </s>
<s> are extremely narrow in hallways and room - gives a very claustrophobic feel to the hotel. </s>
<s> stayed at the Chicago Fairmont for four nights for a conference. </s>
<s> fiance accompanied me. </s>
<s> we checked in ; we were given a room with two full size beds despite the fact that our reservation was for one king size bed. </s>
<s> instead of relaxing on the large luxurious bed we had imagined ; we were forced to either sleep in separate beds like Ward and June Cleaver or either cuddle up on a small full size like two college kids in a fraternity house ! We discovered that the coffee maker was n't working and called down to the desk to have someone look at it ; and waited two and half hours. </s>
<s> had issues with the plumbing ; including extremely slow hot water tap in the bathtub which took 45 minutes to fill. </s>
<s> toilet stopped working twice. </s>
<s> returned one afternoon from the art museum to find the maid in our room ; sitting on the bed ; watching the tv and talking on her cell phone. </s>
<s> bellman were rude ; and would n't let my fiance unload our own car which was packed with some of his very expensive camera equipment. </s>
<s> were errors on our bill. </s>
<s> but not least ; we saw a ROACH in the drawers. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> restaurant downstairs was decent ; and the location is fairly good since my conference was in the Hyatt next door but for the price you can find someplace better. </s>
<s> will never ever stay here again under any circumstances. </s>
<s> is my favorite city visit. </s>
<s> wanted to share this special city with a new love and booked us a room at the Swissotel. </s>
<s> is advertised as close to downtown and close to the museums of Chicago. </s>
<s> wanted to share my new love. </s>
<s> was indeed close to the museums but to get to either the shopping district or the Chicago Art Institute it was a long walk ; full of detours ; and it was not easy to grab a cab. </s>
<s> the rooms seemed to be luxuriously decorated the beds were uncomfortable and the rooms just were not very clean. </s>
<s> Room Service was slow ; the food arrived cold ; and the total experience was way so expensive for what we got. </s>
<s> do not think I have ever experienced the level of noise in such a " grand hotel " as the Swissotel seems. </s>
<s> would not recommend the Swissotel because disappointment ; noise ; and cold food should just not cost that much. </s>
<s> prior to my 5-night reservation with the Hilton Chicago I requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light ; facing an open view ; not a close building. </s>
<s> The reservation was made through a conference travel agency. </s>
<s> '
I confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at check-in the clerk noted it in my record. </s>
<s> told me it would be difficult to find ; but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me. </s>
<s> was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers ; tucked into a very dark corner ; facing a wall of rooms. </s>
<s> called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request ; but to " sit tight " and someone would call me. </s>
<s> one did. </s>
<s> calls yielded similar results. </s>
<s> one point I was told I could have a " parlor room ; " with a sofa bed ; at a reduced rate ; but I could not go see the room before committing to moving. </s>
<s> 's real hospitality for you. </s>
<s> that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave ; I ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room. </s>
<s> I had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds. </s>
<s> '
The only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms. </s>
<s> than that ; it was tight quarters with a tiny closet ; two uncomfortably low chairs ; at the desk and in a ' dark corner. </s>
<s> fixtures did n't do much to brighten things up. </s>
<s> I was here at a conference ; I really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for mid-day calls and e-mail ; but instead I got a cave. </s>
<s> ; I spent as little time as possible in the room and next time I am in Chicago ; conference or not ; I will absolutely stay at another hotel. </s>
<s> are much better locations that the Hilton Chicago and looking at the percentage of " inside tower " rooms ; places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service. </s>

<s> my father caled down to the front desk to ask about this the guy at the front desk asked if my dad wanted him to come up and remove the ashtray and matches - something that would clearly not resolve the fact that they were put in a smoking room after being reassured 3 times that the room was non-smoking. </s>

<s> 
We are Intercontinental Ambassadors ' the rewards club and to get to the Ambassador suite level ; we have to ride a private " express " elevator. </s>

<s> we checked in ; the person behind the counter was rude and acted as if we were lucky to get checked-in. </s>
<s> ; there was a language barrier becuase she was Russian. </s>

<s> we were out of our cab ; our bags had been loaded on a cart we were walked into the hotel by a doorman. </s>
<s> rooms were well appointed the entire hotel staff was very friendly. </s>
<s> is a prime location for shopping ; sightseeing or nightlife. </s>
<s> parents booked five nights at The James for its location and good reviews. </s>
<s> had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff. </s>
<s> sent engineers three times to repair the unit ; and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it was n't ; under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty. </s>
<s> my parents request ; the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort. </s>
<s> hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room. </s>
<s> n't book this hotel in the summer. </s>
<s> by the way ; there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings. </s>
<s> Knickerbocker hotel is fantastic ! It 's an old hotel with updated rooms - so you get the old-timey charm and fresh comfort all at once. </s>
<s> hotel has a fabulous location. </s>
<s> 's a one minute walk to the Cheesecake Factory and Bloomingdales ; and about a 5 minute walk to Einstein Bagel Company ' the best bagels and cream cheese EVER ; Macys and Saks. </s>
<s> location ca n't be beat. </s>
<s> 're at one end of the magnificent mile ; so it makes for easy strolling ; as you do n't start in the middle and then backtrack. </s>
<s> hotel staff are super helpful and friendly. </s>
<s> in and out was very smooth ; and the concierge ' Cheryl was amazing. </s>
<s> booked all our dinner reservations and activities for us ; and recommended an incredible restaurant called Carmines which was a 5 minute walk. </s>
<s> was the greatest italian restaurant I have ever been to ; and I ca n't recommend it more. </s>
<s> rooms are small but not too small. </s>
<s> had a beautiful big samsung flat screen ; cordless phones ; a rain shower ; ample clean towels ; and beautiful marble countertops. </s>
<s> hotel rooms have european charm to them and made me feel like I was at a 5 star hotel in Europe. </s>
<s> beds are very comfortable and the duvet is soft like butter. </s>
<s> only complaint I had was that housekeeping woke us up at 8 : 30 one morning when the knocked on our door despite the fact that we had the do not disturb sign on. </s>
<s> we answered and asked her to come back later she seemed a bit miffed. </s>
<s> issue was corrected ; though ; and it did n't happen again during our 4 night stay. </s>
<s> hotel has some unique items on their room service menu - ie - grilled cheese with mini tomato soup for dipping. </s>
<s> cute. </s>
<s> late night menu ; however ; is lacking. </s>
<s> would have been nice to see some soup on there. </s>
<s> being said ; I RARELY order from room service when on vacation ; so I really do n't see that being a big deal. </s>
<s> I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. </s>

<s> had a wonderful experience and I truly look forward to staying there again . </s>

<s> would n't stay anywhere else ! The Fairmont Chicago Millenium Park Hotel provides a rich ; beautiful ; cultured atmosphere. </s>
<s> my stay ; I felt like royalty. </s>
<s> unparalleled design schemes and beautiful ; tranquil views ; the mood during my entire stay was one of bliss. </s>

<s> never received a return call from General Manager Sanjay Mahajan after several voicemails. </s>
<s> will never return to the hotel and will work to spread the word. </s>
<s> also heard from several employees from the cleaning staff that this is common in the hotel. </s>
<s> husband and I recently spent 3 nights at the Ambassador East Hotel. </s>
<s> will never stay at this hotel again. </s>
<s> the steep price we paid to stay there ; we expected a friendly staff and clean room ; which we did not get. </s>
<s> of all ; the rooms are not clean. </s>
<s> found a few bugs in our room and the sheets did not look like they have been recently changed. </s>
<s> we reported this information to the hotel staff ; they did not do anything to help us out. </s>
<s> staff is very unfriendly. </s>
<s> ; there were no clean towels to use in the bathroom. </s>
<s> had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance ; yet was given a room facing the street from which I could hear traffic noise. </s>
<s> asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day. </s>
<s> next morning ; prior to being moved to a quiet room ; the toilet in my original room overflowed creating a large unsanitary flood. </s>
<s> an hour later I was moved to a room which did not face the street. </s>
<s> room was quiet but smaller and darker. </s>
<s> mattresses in each room were very firm ; I would even say hard. </s>
<s> asked if any softer mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same. </s>
<s> checkout I tried to give the hotel a form of payment that differed from the card the room was reserved under ; and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes ; which seemed longer because the van to the airport was waiting right outside ; with other passengers. </s>
<s> The cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later. </s>
<s> '
As recompense for the noise ; flood ; etc. </s>
<s> ; the hotel offered exactly nothing. </s>
<s> a great stay. </s>
<s> Chicago - I stayed at the James Chicago last month when I flew into Chicago as a getaway from school for spring break. </s>
<s> the hotel is supposed to be ' Luxury Liberated ; there is no liberation whatsoever ; I tell you. </s>
<s> of all ; its for people in luxury. </s>
<s> the hotel looks pretty affordable from what they display on the site and a few of the reviews I read ; it is very expensive. </s>
<s> valet parking to internet - everything is charged extra. </s>
<s> lights in the rooms were incandescent and hurt my eyes a lot. </s>
<s> food at the restaurant was as if they served dishes cooked a week back. </s>
<s> hotel staff were snobby and I was definitely not treated well. </s>
<s> the day I checked in ; I was so uneasy that I was glad to check out and get outta there. </s>
<s> for the beautiful view from the 10th floor ' where my room was ; my experience was something I 'd put behind me. </s>

<s> the uniforms of the staff . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  which consists of a small J pin that they wear with nice suits and such ; to the wonderful ; comfortable beds ; the James just makes you feel ultra-relaxed. </s>

<s> really enjoyed the complimentary Kiehl 's products as well as the soft ; cushy beds with futons. </s>
<s> ; it 's just off Michigan ave ; and it 's close to all the shops and restaurants. </s>
<s> 'd definitely stay here if I 'm ever back in Chicago. </s>

<s> pretty much only stay at Hilton properties and have stayed at tons from Hawaii all the way to Budapest. </s>
<s> Hilton is not up to par. </s>
<s> 's clean and the front desk staff is nice ; but in Chicago ; The Drake ; Doubletree Guest Suites ; and even the Hilton Garden Inn are all superior to the Chicago Hilton ' and less expensive. </s>
<s> to other Hilton properties in Chicago ; the rooms were not as well appointed ; the bathrooms in the rooms were smaller and not as nice ; the TV was tiny ; the hallways on the executive floor were very noisy all night long ; and the breakfast you get was more like a Hampton Inn than a 4 star hotel. </s>
<s> you 're going to Chicago and you like Hilton brand hotels ; you can do far better than this place. </s>
<s> became an Ambassador member just before spending Mother 's day at the Chicago Intercontinental ; and received a room upgrade to an exceptional room. </s>
<s> Saturday night stay was the BEST $ 99 we ever spent ' Mother 's day special. </s>
<s> welcoming chocolate covered strawberries began the weekend on a high note ; the concierge continued it by arranging a wonderful dinner ' moderately priced ; and the great Sunday breakfast topped it all off. </s>
<s> in all ; Mother 's day in Chicago was Super. </s>
<s> loved it enough to be back for Labor Day weekend ' another " package " . </s>
<s> stayed at this hotel for a weekend and I thought it was really nice. </s>
<s> bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean. </s>
<s> room also had a beautiful view. </s>
<s> had everything you could possibly need. </s>
<s> almost did n't want to leave the room. </s>

<s> would go back. </s>
<s> clientel was also very helpful. </s>
<s> 'm a frequent business traveler and often in Chicago on trips. </s>
<s> times ; it 's very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown Chicago ; and this was one of those times. </s>
<s> recently had to pay almost $ 400 for one night at the Allegro. </s>
<s> was absolutely not worth it. </s>
<s> hotel was filled to capacity with conventioneers ; so check-in and check-out were very slow. </s>
<s> were very few elevators ; which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests. </s>
<s> morning I checked out ; our elevator stopped at every single floor from the 16th floor down to the lobby ; but the elevator was almost completely full when I got on at the 18th floor ; so I can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs. </s>
<s> room was extremely small and cramped ; even though it had obviously been renovated recently. </s>
<s> TV ; bed ; and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel. </s>
<s> ; the rate was way overpriced for such a small room. </s>
<s> best thing about the Allegro was the room service ; which was prompt. </s>
<s> food was good ; and the prices were very reasonable for room service. </s>
<s> now on ; if my regular hotels are booked ; I 'll just take a cab farther out from the city because it just is n't worth it. </s>
<s> James Hotel -- I had high hopes with a 5 star hotel. </s>
<s> ; I was not impressed by it whatsoever. </s>
<s> Audi cab service ; they contend is best ; was not timely ; kept me waiting for half an hour at the airport. </s>
<s> felt it was quite expensive just because of the location and rich interiors ; but the service was not as impressive. </s>
<s> room service was quick ; but it took long before I could contact them owing to the busy phone extensions. </s>
<s> view from my room was not impressive as well ; although I shopped a lot around the magnificent mile ending up spending a lot of money. </s>
<s> would have loved a more serene place ; but had no other choice this time. </s>
<s> check out they kept me waiting for a mere cheque payment. </s>
<s> could be a nice place for a business personnel but this time it was quite a disappointment to me. </s>
<s> must say ; this hotel is absolutely beautiful. </s>
<s> wife and I were blown away by the penthouse fitness center and pool all the way up on the 42nd floor. </s>
<s> well designed rooms with great linens and pillows. </s>
<s> bathrooms were a nice change of pace from the boring hotel bathrooms we usually see. </s>
<s> an excellent experience here ; great views and close to everything you could want to do in Chicago. </s>
<s> Chicago Hilton is a great hotel our stay there was fantastic. </s>
<s> hotel is placed in the heart of the city were you can find it a easy walk to almost everything from the local colleges to the great restaurant that surround the city. </s>
<s> room itself was clean and the staff was fun and helpful. </s>
<s> ca n't really say anything bad about this place it was a great time and a great place to stay while we were there. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed overnight at the Affinia. </s>
<s> reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel ; not true. </s>
<s> it was a very special occasion ; and also because we were only staying overnight ; we did n't let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend. </s>
<s> ; this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences. </s>
<s> 've ever had. </s>
<s> ; the smells : The linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy. </s>
<s> odors were not mild ; and I found it pretty repulsive. </s>
<s> could n't wait to jump out of bed in the morning ; to get away from the odors. </s>
<s> to sleep and certainly did n't want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary. </s>
<s> did n't discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed. </s>
<s> that point ; I chose not to contact housekeeping because ' a I was exhausted ; and ' b I did n't want to upset my husband ; who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing. </s>
<s> ; the bathroom smelled like vinegar. </s>
<s> this is the cleaning agent used by Affinia ; but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did. </s>
<s> ; the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days ; not a well-maintained property. </s>
<s> ; the elevators : If you stay above the first few floors ; there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop c-view bar. </s>
<s> so many floors to service ; and so many people going up to the c-view bar on a saturday ; these elevators took forever to come ; and were often full they did. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; on one occasion ; there were several bottles ' water and soda left in the elevator ; clearly ; the maintenance crew does n't inspect and clean the common areas frequently. </s>
<s> ; and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived. </s>
<s> ; when we booked ; we asked for as quiet a room as possible. </s>
<s> hotel is located near Northwestern Memorial Hospital. </s>
<s> ; its proximity to Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> ; and the lack of accomodations elsewhere ' due to the Transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same week-end ; led us to stay here anyway. </s>
<s> check-in ; the clerk noted our request ; and said our room was quiet room since it was not " next to the elevators. </s>
<s> " 
When we arrived at our room ; we discovered that we were across from the elevators. </s>
<s> ; she was technically correct that we were n't next to the elevators ; but it was still so close ' 15-20 feet that we could hear the elevator noise. </s>
<s> ; since it was a special occasion ; we asked if we could upgrade. </s>
<s> disingenuous ; snarky ; condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade. </s>
<s> ; the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels ; this is a matter of routine ; not exception. </s>
<s> awful experience all the way around. </s>
<s> reviewers must have very low expectations. </s>
<s> n't explain any of the good reviews otherwise. </s>
<s> Family and I went to this hotel on holiday last month. </s>
<s> was a very bad hotel. </s>
<s> we got there we imediatly checked in and went up to our room. </s>
<s> view from the window was a brick wall. </s>
<s> ? We even asked the Lasy at the front desk ; but she said they could n't put us in a room with a view cause we did n't book one and we could n't upgrade. </s>
<s> ; My Wife is a light sleeper and the trains kept her up at night. </s>
<s> thing is alot of ads boast a hot tub in all the rooms but this is not true ; our room only had a normal tub. </s>
<s> ; the tub had no stopper ; so we could only take showers. </s>
<s> room was also very small compared to other hotels with around the same prices. </s>
<s> Ambassador Hotel is located in Downtown Chicago right off Lakeshore Drive in the heart of the hotel industry downtown. </s>
<s> would recommend you look to one of those other hotels if you are wanting a place to stay downtown. </s>
<s> rates at this hotel indicate that it would be a top of the line place to stay ; when in fact ; we had a pretty unpleasant experience. </s>
<s> started with someone who was obviously a new employee checking us in. </s>
<s> have no problem with this ; except the fact that this person was the only one on duty and had difficulties checking us in and had no one to assist him. </s>
<s> checking in ; we went up to our room and were a bit disappointed. </s>
<s> pictures do not accurately depict the size of these rooms ; they are very tiny and offer very little room to store luggage where it is out of the way. </s>
<s> beds were not very comfortable and when we called room service for extra pillows ; they took over an hour to arrive. </s>
<s> will not be staying at this hotel anytime in the future. </s>
<s> stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers recently ; and I was completely dissatisfied. </s>
<s> I arrived the clerk was very rude to my guest and myself. </s>
<s> finally got all of our things figured out and went to our room. </s>
<s> is a river right outside and i constantly heard boats passing by. </s>
<s> bathroom was disgusting and not to mention ; very small. </s>
<s> did not have a very pleasant experience at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. </s>
<s> never thought I 'd be able to stay at a hotel and feel completely at home. </s>
<s> am a mother of two children ; one of which has severe asthma and allergies. </s>
<s> have spent more time in hospital emergency rooms than my own living room for the past two and a half years. </s>
<s> when my sister was getting married in Chicago ; I was extremely anxious. </s>
<s> front desk associate ; Rosa ; was wonderful. </s>
<s> told me that they have Allergy friendly rooms. </s>

<s> booked a room ; but was still really worried. </s>
<s> should n't have been. </s>
<s> breathed as easily in that beautiful room as he did in our own home. </s>
<s> even a little better. </s>
<s> had an air purification system for our room. </s>
<s> smelled so fresh ! While my husband took our daughter to the Big Bar for Nachos ' she never stopped talking about how " totally cool " it was ; I ordered room service for my son. </s>
<s> man who answered the phone was so patient and accommodating. </s>
<s> son has a lot of food allergies ; so I was pretty much ordering off menu with specific details. </s>
<s> 's always a little humbling ; but the staff treated my order with the grace as though they did special orders all the time. </s>
<s> was actually able to enjoy my sister 's wedding. </s>
<s> only problem with my stay is that it was too short. </s>
<s> 're coming back for our first family vacation since Ethan was born. </s>
<s> you ; Hyatt Regency Chicago ; for making this family 's visit possible and positive ! I enjoyed my stay at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> staff was friendly and helpful from the time I checked in all the way through checkout. </s>
<s> hotel was very clean and well maintained. </s>
<s> beds were very comfortable ! The hotel restaurant 'lounge was very cozy and a nice way to unwind after a long day. </s>
<s> only thing I was unhappy about was the fact that internet service is not complimentary at this hotel. </s>
<s> reccomend this hotel and I will stay there again on my next trip to Chicago ! If you asked me two years ago ; I would have recommended the Talbott Hotel without hesitation to anyone who asked. </s>
<s> ; I have definitely changed my mind. </s>
<s> this hotel is located in a nice area of Chicago ; surrounded by great restaurants ; shops and affluent people ; it has really begun to slowly downgrade. </s>
<s> noted by my reviews ; I am incredibly serious about customer service. </s>
<s> you 're in the hospitality industry ; there is really no excuse for falling short in this category --- but alas ; the Talbott really has. </s>
<s> door staff do n't say a word ; the desk people acknowledge you only when they are not doing a million other things ' which they always are and the staff have an air of snobbishness. </s>
<s> since we ; the customers ; are paying to stay at their over-priced hotel. </s>
<s> the most annoying aspect of my latest stay was that I had to walk down 11 flights of stairs to get to the lobby of the hotel because I waited a solid 15 minutes for the elevator ; which ; when it arrived ; was packed to the brim. </s>
<s> get that it 's an old hotel ; but it is incredibly annoying that they only have two elevators for the entire place and when one is down for construction ; the other one overflows with people and I am forced to walk ELEVEN flights to simply get to my dinner reservation on time ' which I didn 't. </s>
<s> '
I will not continue giving this hotel my business and have other better recommendations to give to friends who plan on visiting. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel ; in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> my three days there I experienced the worst service of my life ! We made reservations before-hand and upon arrival our room was already booked. </s>
<s> took us nearly two hours to actually get into our room ' After being given the wrong key !. </s>
<s> we entered the room ; the sheets were stained with what seemed to be cherry kool-aid. </s>
<s> am going to assume that it wasn 't. </s>
<s> a night on the town we were bummed for money by three homeless men outside the hotel. </s>
<s> arriving in our room and hoping for a nice hot shower ; we found a note on our door with a " sorry " note explaining they did n't have any hot water. </s>
<s> the next morning we were awoken by housekeeping ' we had a DND sign on our door. </s>
<s> we decided to wake up and go out for breakfast. </s>
<s> to find out our car was broken into in their parking garage. </s>
<s> filed a police report and the police asked the managers for a video of the surveillance. </s>
<s> for us their surveillance was out of memory to record anymore. </s>
<s> to say we left early the next day and I will never return to such a dreadful hotel ever again. </s>
<s> Chicago Water Tower - My friends and I decided to take a vacation to Chicago following our college graduation and we stayed at the Hotel Sofitel. </s>
<s> rooms were incredible ; it was the first time I slept on a king-sized bed ! All the decor from the little hand soap containers ; to the wall paper had a touch of luxury. </s>
<s> did n't really spend much time in the hotel bar ; because it was so close to all the nightlife. </s>
<s> ; we chose not to eat too many meals in the hotel ; but the breakfast we had was classy and delicious. </s>

<s> staying at the Amalfi Hotel I may never stay in a regular motel again ! Right off the bat instead of a 40 foot counter with snooty workers or kids that started two days ago they have individual desks for check in with people that ' gasp have a clue as to what they are doing. </s>
<s> got the steakhouse package deal at the on-site Keefer 's Steakhouse restaurant the food was the highest quality and cooked to perfection. </s>
<s> room was spacious had robes and slippers ; a stocked mini-bar ; The mattress was comfy ; and the whole room was clean. </s>
<s> staff was amazing and had no problems bringing extra towels and pillows for my wife. </s>
<s> the morning the continental breakfast was served on each floor instead of herding into the lobby which I loved cause I love breakfast but not crowds. </s>
<s> for me the hotel was close to a lot of shopping ; my wife was in heaven however ; and we spent a large portion of the day on the magnificent mile attempting to max out my credit cards. </s>
<s> whole trip I believe was made special by the atmosphere of the hotel and its staff I would recommend the Amalfi to anyone visiting Chicago. </s>
<s> stayed at the Swissotel Chicago while I was on holiday recently and I have to say ; that you definitely get what you pay for ! I was initially attracted by their inexpensive prices for the luxury that they promised. </s>
<s> was sorely mistaken. </s>
<s> first problem I had was when I got there they told me that they had double booked the suite I had reserved. </s>
<s> gave me a discount but had to downgrade me to a regular room. </s>
<s> should have left then but I decided to keep an open mind. </s>
<s> we were all settled in my husband and I went to The Palm restaurant. </s>
<s> husband has food allergies and they got his order wrong so we had to send it back three times. </s>
<s> time we asked them to fix it ; they stormed off angrily and would return in a huff. </s>
<s> dinner ; we went back to our room. </s>
<s> sitting on the bed I knew it would be a long night. </s>
<s> mattress was hard and the blankets had a bad smell to them. </s>
<s> I went to the restroom ; the toilet had not been cleaned from the previous patrons ! My husband grabbed a blanket out of the car and we used it instead of the smelly one. </s>
<s> just did n't want to bother the desk staff after the cold reception when we had walked in. </s>
<s> tried their massage service the next day and the massage therapist was very unprofessional. </s>
<s> pressed really had and hurt my back. </s>
<s> it was because he was distracted with all the texting he was doing off and on throughout the session ! For lunch we tried Geneva restaurant in the hotel and the food was not cooked all the way. </s>
<s> decided to eat it anyway and got food poisoning about an hour later ! Once I got sick ; I was done. </s>
<s> went to the desk and demanded a refund for the next two nights because I was not going to sleep there one more night. </s>
<s> made a formal complaint with the manager who seemed to act like it was our fault and that we were being unreasonable. </s>
<s> a lot of arguing ; he finally refunded us and we went to a different hotel. </s>
<s> was the worst place I had ever stayed ! I think a Super 8 Motel would have been more luxurious ! This was my first time staying at the Hard Rock hotel in Chicago and I have nothing but hate for the entire experience. </s>
<s> building itself is maintained ; however the staff is rude and inept to the point of making their customers feel physically ill. </s>
<s> while the outside appearance is fine and dandy ; my room 325 ; was repulsive. </s>
<s> soon as the bellboy threw my luggage onto the room 's ground and verbally demanded a tip ; I noticed insects of all kinds scurrying around ; the room was pungent with what smelled like human excrement ; before I could say anything to the bellboy he had taken his tip and fled. </s>
<s> I went to the front desk and was made to wait for over a half hour ; a complete waste of time ; because as soon as I had reported my problem I was told that no other rooms were available and I would have to make do ; they did however say I could stay the night free of charge. </s>
<s> next morning as I was set to leave I decided I would try the breakfast ; in hopes of finding one redeeming quality. </s>
<s> me tell you ; that breakfast tasted like space food with dirt and mold ; the worst breakfast I have ever had in my entire life. </s>
<s> the employees are arrogant and callous ; with the work ethic of a 2 year old child ; they can not cook ; the room for me was poorly maintained ; however they are good at refunding your money. </s>
<s> stayed three nights recently at the Hilton Homewood Suites- Downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> I ca n't rate this establishment highly. </s>
<s> person at the front desk was disorganized- and took over 10 minutes even to find my reservation. </s>
<s> I finally got my key ; the desk person just thrust the keycard at me like she was happy to be rid of me. </s>
<s> did n't get any better when I got to my suite. </s>
<s> bed was poorly made ; and I found a couple of long blonde hairs on one of the pillows. </s>
<s> room was very stuffy ; and I swear might have even had a vague pet smell. </s>
<s> shower was not very clean- notable hard water stains on the shower door ; and the bathroom sink had a small continuous drip. </s>
<s> ; the carpets did n't seem fresh and even had high traffic dirt noticable. </s>

<s> had limited equipment that was in poor repair. </s>
<s> floor in there was even slippery ; which made it a definite trip hazard. </s>
<s> the indoor pool looked good ; as I dipped into it ; the water felt a bit slimy and did not have a good smell. </s>
<s> in all ; the amenities ; the unfriendly service ; and the sub-standard cleanliness makes this hotel one I would definitely not recommend to anyone. </s>
<s> that is paired with their sky high room rates ; it 's just not a place that should earn any repeat guests. </s>
<s> visit Chicago ; but this was my first stay at this location. </s>
<s> able to secure a good rate through travelzoo. </s>
<s> the room was clean and was nicely decorated. </s>
<s> very disappointed in the service. </s>
<s> on a Saturday night - waited 20 minutes for extra pillows - called for 15 minutes but found out the third shift crew came in 20 minutes late. </s>
<s> received an incorrect folio under my door 'another guests that was staying at this location. </s>
<s> called the front dest to inform them of the error - and they explained that this was made in error and would be corrected. </s>
<s> opened my credit card statement and found that I was charged for three different rooms - one on the date of my visit and two a week later. </s>
<s> called the hotel and guest services took the information and forwarded to their accounting department. </s>
<s> a message to call the billing department ; have called three times - but have not received another reply back. </s>
<s> booked our room at the Swissotel on Hotwire for $ 88 ' unbelievable rate ! and were extremely impressed with the Swissotel. </s>
<s> staff was so polite and catered to our every need. </s>
<s> room was oversized ; clean ; and had a large bathroom. </s>
<s> had a partial view of Lake Michigan ; which was an added bonus. </s>
<s> the 42nd floor ; they have a spotless workout room and pool with a view of the city and lake from 3 sides. </s>
<s> ! We sat in the hot tub and looked down on Navy Pier. </s>
<s> ca n't wait to go to the Swissotel again ! Sofitel Chicago Water Tower - Staying at the Sofitel Chicago was honestly a fairly mediocre experience. </s>
<s> the rate that we got ; the room was really underwhelming. </s>
<s> lot of the decor was tacky and the feeling was too forced. </s>
<s> hotel bar was overpriced and when we decided to leave ; the concierge was unhelpful in letting us know about the surrounding nightlife of any sort. </s>
<s> furniture did n't feel uncomfortable but I woke up in the night several times and did n't rest well. </s>
<s> would much rather prefer a generic hotel for the money we spent. </s>
<s> ! That is all I can say ! My girlfriends and I recently went on a little ' excursion to Chicago for a girls weekend and we stayed at this beautiful hotel. </s>
<s> rooms were beautifully decorated in a comfortable ; modern style. </s>
<s> beds were so comfortable and cozy with the softest bedding I have ever felt on a hotel bed. </s>
<s> views were just as amazing. </s>
<s> could even see Lake Michigan from our suite. </s>
<s> only dined in the hotel once during our trip ; but it was the best time we had. </s>
<s> Aria Restaurant was so elegant yet fun. </s>
<s> clean and just a great atmosphere. </s>
<s> staff was extremely professional and courteous ; going out of their way to ensure our stay was a pleasure from the moment we walked through their doors. </s>
<s> recommended ! A must see next time you visit this area. </s>
<s> had stayed at Amalfi for my weekend visit to Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel was easy to find and was close to many establishments for a night in the city. </s>
<s> valet staff was pleasant and courteous. </s>
<s> room was very comfortable and spacious with a large bathroom. </s>
<s> free WiFi was a big plus. </s>
<s> a frequent traveler myself ; I have frequently faced problems with hotel food. </s>
<s> ; Amalfi provided a breakfast bar on each floor with delicious pastries. </s>
<s> dinner ; I was able to order food from Harry Caray 's Tavern from across the street. </s>
<s> was pleasantly surprised at food options available. </s>
<s> am totally in love with this hotel and would highly recommend it to my friends. </s>
<s> Sofitel Chicago Water Tower ; while seemingly a good idea in theory ; has many drawbacks. </s>
<s> first glance ; it appears quite luxurious and grand ; but some of its shortcomings can not be overlooked. </s>
<s> hotel is quite tall ; coming in at 32 stories ; and the noise from adjoining floors and rooms is sometimes quite annoying. </s>
<s> staff members do little to try to ameliorate the situation for the dissatisfied guest ; so it seems as if your pleas for help go unnoticed. </s>
<s> hotel tries to adopt a French flavor ; but its efforts fall short. </s>
<s> only real French influences are found in the names of restaurants and bars. </s>
<s> hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city ; but this location also adds to the less-than-cozy feel of the establishment. </s>
<s> same complaint about the guest rooms and noise applies to the hotel in general. </s>
<s> city 's traffic and noise both detract from the ability to fully enjoy one 's stay here. </s>
<s> ; I would not recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> a different choice. </s>
<s> all the hype and rave reviews of the Talbott Hotel ; it seemed to me that it would be a mistake to NOT stay there ; not the other way around. </s>
<s> Talbott Hotel website claims to have " opulent accommodations ; impeccable service ; and unexpected delights. </s>
<s> " 
The last time I checked ; " opulent " had a bit of a different meaning than " easily outdone by the senile 90-year-old landlord of your college apartment ; " " impeccable " was n't code for " rude and unfriendly ; " and " unexpected delights " were more fun than a faint but obvious stain on your sheets at a hotel. </s>
<s> ; my stay here simply was n't worth the money or the hassle involved in making the correct reservations. </s>
<s> a lot less ; I could have been treated rudely and had a mediocre stay in a more casual environment. </s>
<s> in old tower. </s>
<s> was nice and room service was very good. </s>
<s> Wi-Fi was expensive as was the bottled water. </s>
<s> the price of the room ; at least there should at least have been water. </s>
<s> would rate the value as sub-par. </s>
<s> restaurant menu was not great ; food mediocre by comparison to other downtown Chicago restaurants and the service was below average especially since there were only three tables in use in the entire restaurant . </s>

In summary ; I will go to the M . </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> you are a fitness room user ; the $ 16 per stay per person is a good deal at this hotel. </s>
<s> was very disappointed with this hotel. </s>
<s> have stayed in other Swissotels and enjoyed them very much ; but the service can only be described as aloof. </s>
<s> was no warmth during the prolonged checkin procedure ; and the woman repeatedly asked me to provide information I had given her minutes ago. </s>
<s> ; indeed. </s>
<s> service took forever to pick up ' good sign in a way 'busy because they are good ; but the food arrived very late and very cold. </s>
<s> man tried to replace it ; but than took another hour ; and I was never given a price reduction ; free dessert ; or anything to apologize. </s>
<s> for cleanliness ; they must be next to godly ; as they knocked on my door at 0800 ; despite the fact I had a doorknocker requesting no service ' I 'm a late sleeper. </s>

Very disappointed with my stay. </s>
<s> hotel clearly did not help build the chain 's reputation. </s>
<s> stayed at Hotel Monaco and upgraded to a suite. </s>
<s> was disappointed with the room layout ; and shabby furniture. </s>
<s> bumped into the coffee table and the top almost crashed to the ground. </s>
<s> make up mirror in the bathroom didnt work ; the TV reception was very poor and overall the room just wasnt worth the $ 450 we spent there. </s>

<s> is a located in a fantastic spot on the Magnificent Mile ; right near the Chicago River and the NBC building. </s>
<s> had a double room in the main tower. </s>
<s> room was very clean and updated. </s>

<s> ; parking is high $ 45 valet 'day. </s>
<s> ; we had a great stay and would recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> paid $ 90 on Priceline and felt that this was a reasonable price. </s>
<s> not enjoy my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. </s>
<s> ; the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful. </s>
<s> was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle. </s>
<s> when we finally got the reservation sorted out ; the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees. </s>
<s> I paid well over $ 250 per night for the Romance package reservation ; it was below my standards and I will not be heading back to the Omni Chicago Hotel any time soon. </s>
<s> booked a room at Swissotel Chicago because I thought the price was reasonable ; and at the base price it was ; however ; it ended up costing more than I had planned for ; as you have to pay for parking and other amenities. </s>
<s> service was not very good ; considering they market themselves as a luxury hotel. </s>
<s> was no one there to help us bring in our bags when we had a difficult time doing so ; and the staff were cold. </s>
<s> in all ; I would say it was an average experience . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  not luxurious like they claim it to be. </s>
<s> we were stranded in Chicago for two days since our flight home was canceled ; our airline put us in touch with hotels. </s>

<s> ca n't wait to go back again ! Palmer House a Hilton Hotel - I travel with my cat ; and finding good ; pet friendly places to stay can be difficult ; so I 'm really glad a friend pointed me to the Palmer Hilton in Chicago. </s>
<s> rooms were large ; comfortable ; and well-kept. </s>
<s> points for the extra-wide bathroom mirror ; double bonus points for having an outlet near but not behind the desk ! Too many hotels force you to move furniture just to plug your laptop in for work. </s>
<s> the self and and valet parking options were a bit pricey ; but the hotel location is actually convenient enough that I may forgo my car entirely next time and just walk. </s>
<s> lot of the major " must-see " places ; like Millenium Park or the Art Institute ; are just a couple blocks away ; and multiple bus stops and subway stations are within walking distance as well. </s>

<s> recommend to others. </s>
<s> Monaco is a luxurious hotel situated in the heart of Chicago. </s>

<s> Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago - Despite its somewhat odd name ; I found staying at this hotel to be a delightful experience. </s>
<s> hallways and high-ceilinged lobby give the feel of a mansion as you walk in. </s>
<s> rooms maintain this atmosphere ; as they are impeccably cleaned and tastefully furnished. </s>
<s> beds are nice and soft and very easy to fall asleep in. </s>
<s> coffee every morning ; excellent for coffee lovers like myself. </s>
<s> thing to watch out for : The texture of the towels feels a bit rough. </s>
<s> want to bring you own. </s>
<s> this is only a minor distraction from an otherwise great stay. </s>
<s> highly recommend the Millennium Knickerbocker. </s>
<s> International Chicago Magnificent Mile is shrouded in glamour ; but underneath the facade fades away. </s>
<s> " classical architectural landmark " should be translated to " old and boring. </s>
<s> found this hotel via Google and have regretted it ever since. </s>
<s> size was small and unaccommodating ; and that was one of the newer rooms ! Everything was free except for the gym ' why that would n't be free with the price I paid I do n't know. </s>
<s> hotel is overpriced for the quality and size of the room that you get ; and I would not recommend staying there. </s>
<s> husband and I snagged a great deal on a weekend trip to Chicago ; and decided ' at the recommendation of friends to stay at the Palmer House Hilton. </s>
<s> only word we can use to describe it is " amazing " ! Walking into the lobby feels like stepping back in time ; it is simply breath-taking. </s>
<s> sure to check out the ceiling ; I have never seen one so beautiful outside of Europe. </s>
<s> checked-in without any issues and were assigned a very lovely room with the most comfortable bed I have encountered in any hotel. </s>

<s> were hungry and tired when we checked into the Chicago Sheraton. </s>
<s> nice clerk at the front desk got us checked in efficiently and with a warm smile. </s>
<s> made us dinner reservations at Shula 's ' giving us time to shower and change and arranged for a bellhop to take our bags up to the room for us - what service ! We enjoyed our steaks and the bottle of wine that was recommended by the waiter at Shula 's - truly a lovely meal. </s>
<s> we returned to our room we were delighted to find that the towels had been replenished and the bed turned down ! We enjoyed the view from our room before turning in and having a very restful night 's sleep in an incredibly comfortable bed. </s>
<s> to the Chicago Sheraton for getting everything just right ! Staying at the Swissotel in downtown Chicago is not so much the typical stay so much as it is an experience. </s>
<s> only is the hotel located in a great area to get to all local attractions ; but while you are at the hotel you will have many amazing accommodations at your disposal. </s>
<s> are two gourmet on site restaurants and a lounge to relax and get great food. </s>
<s> rooms are over sized and the beds are among the most comfortable you will ever find. </s>
<s> ; the service is award winning so anything that you do not already have at the Swissotel will be at your fingertips with their assistance. </s>

<s> amenities and fixtures are sleek and attractive as well. </s>
<s> of all ; the hotel has breathtaking views of the city and the water - both the river and the lake. </s>
<s> you 're working in the area ; it 's the best choice for that part of town ; and I prefer it to the nearby Hyatt and Monaco. </s>
<s> stayed here 2 nights for a business conference. </s>
<s> food was pretty good. </s>
<s> they had these really good mints that I could n't resist. </s>
<s> room was very comfortable and the bed was great. </s>
<s> I was annoyed by many issues. </s>
<s> ; their internet went down for a couple of hour when I was there on a break from the conference. </s>
<s> would n't have been big deal except I needed to do some business while it was down. </s>
<s> ; the internet was n't available in the conference rooms. </s>
<s> suppose the conference I attended would have had to pay extra for it. </s>
<s> ; The chair in the room was too low for the desk so I was in an awkward position while using my computer which gave me a back ache later. </s>
<s> ; on the second night my key did n't work. </s>
<s> I asked for a new one which also did n't work. </s>
<s> I asked for another one and the same thing happened. </s>
<s> the front desk asked a security guy to meet me up at my room so I did n't have to go back down to the lobby a third time. </s>
<s> he came back a little later to tell me I was in the wrong room ; which I wasn 't. </s>
<s> ; he came back with the right key. </s>
<s> ; the TV had one remote control for changing the channels and a different one for the volume. </s>

<s> Hotels : The Sheraton Chicago Hotel Towers - While the Sheraton Chicago is an ok place to stay I simply can not recommend it over others in the area. </s>
<s> the room itself was ok our bathroom was quite small and even worse it was quite moldy. </s>
<s> indoor pool was not only small but also too cold. </s>
<s> the worst ; the hotel 's food services were quite limited and expensive. </s>
<s> stayed at Omni Chicago for 2 nights in early July ' July 1-3. </s>
<s> reason we chose this hotel was simply because of a great deal we got on TravelZoo. </s>
<s> got pretty good rate that included a valet parking and vouchers for food 'beverages. </s>
<s> also signed up for their loyalty program ; which was so worth it. </s>
<s> was concerned at first that we would be treated like a second-class guest because of the price we paid. </s>
<s> I was totally wrong ! They treated us extremely well. </s>
<s> our arrival ; I got an email asking if we needed anything. </s>
<s> ; I asked for a fridge to store the baby milk. </s>

<s> also got complimentary beverages as part of the loyalty program. </s>
<s> ordered OJ and hot chocolate. </s>
<s> both were so good that we ordered them again the next morning. </s>
<s> we were very disappointed that the hot chocolate tasted pretty horrible. </s>
<s> tasted like left-over coffee mixed with water and a bit of chocolate : Also ; we ordered Belgian waffle for our breakfast ; which was supposed to come with whipped cream and strawberries . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but we got a plain waffle. </s>
<s> ; we had to call the restaurant and wait for a while to get those. </s>
<s> is why I did n't give " 5 " for service. </s>
<s> ; I reported these issues to the front-desk when checking out ; and the front-desk staff took care of it by not charging us for that meal. </s>
<s> thing is that it 's quite noisy at night even though we were on the high floor. </s>
<s> could hear siren going on off during the night. </s>
<s> this is out of the hotel 's control though. </s>
<s> I would say that it did n't bother us at all. </s>
<s> baby could sleep very well. </s>

<s> " 
Never has a hotel answered my call so rudely. </s>

<s> just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel. </s>
<s> had requested a high floor ; quiet room. </s>

<s> windows are not well insulated ; because the traffic ; car horns and sirens continued all night long. </s>
<s> the first night two drunk parties woke us up in the hallway. </s>
<s> safe in our room did not work. </s>

<s> of the pictures under the tv had been removed ; leaving a screw sticking out of the wall. </s>
<s> lights are so dim ; that is next to impossible to read. </s>

<s> room key cards did n't work ; so we returned to the lobby where they recoded them. </s>
<s> returning to our room ; they did n't work again and we stood there trying over and over again until finally we succeeded with no help from the staff. </s>

<s> booked the reservation on priceline for $ 75 'night which was the cheapest rate I could find anywhere during a convention week. </s>

<s> told the customer service rep that I had never heard of such a practice ; but she said ; in a very smug manner ; that I was told back in January. </s>
<s> honestly do n't remember being told of the cancellation policy ; but think it is a unprofessional practice to capture some additional dollars since it is not an industry standard to require a seven day cancellation policy when you book directly with the hotel. </s>
<s> ; for one ; will never stay at a Hard Rock hotel and will make sure that my friends and business associaties know of this unfair practice. </s>

<s> hotel information said it closed at 2am so we came back to hotel at 1230am for a " night cap " ; that was last call. </s>
<s> was fine for us ; but the bar was full and many people were coming back from their night wanting a " night cap " but did not make last call. </s>
<s> night ended listening to many unhappy people complaining and receiving no sympathy from the employees. </s>

<s> a disappoitment ! The room we stayed in had 2 double beds. </s>

<s> Hotel - So ; I booked a stay at the Talbott hotel ; which came heavily recommend to me by pretty much everybody I talked to. </s>
<s> a bit on the pricey side ; I have no regrets choosing this fine establishment. </s>
<s> do recommend for all you looking to save a penny not to valet park. </s>
<s> arrived in the afternoon ; maybe around two or three and got the keys to my room without much delay. </s>
<s> thing I noticed was how large the rooms are. </s>
<s> stayed in a double queen room and there was plenty of space to move around. </s>
<s> drapes are aesthetic and pleasing to the eye. </s>
<s> pillows are soft and comfortable. </s>
<s> bed is framed with a beautiful brown coating. </s>
<s> bathrooms are roomy with a glass shower and bathtub combination and the two marble sinks are very convenient. </s>
<s> is even a reclining chair and ottoman for me to relax on. </s>
<s> food is a whole different matter. </s>
<s> Little Market Brasserie gives you a wide assortment of food from so many cultures from around the world. </s>
<s> French lemon flavored dishes were delicious and the short ribs were made well. </s>
<s> thought I got them from wherever they originate from ' definitely not Chicago. </s>
<s> also have the choice of eating outside on little tables enjoying the view ; when it 's not to windy that is. </s>
<s> ; the spacious and beautiful hotel is a great place for anybody willing to indulge themselves. </s>
<s> a terrible experience my family and I had at Affinia Chicago ! First of all ; we reserved a room with 2 queen size beds and received only 1 King size bed with a cot. </s>
<s> we got to the room ; we found hair balls on the floor as if a cat had previously stayed there. </s>
<s> an absolute terror Affinia was and I will never be going back ! Last weekend my wife and i decided to take a weekend trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> looking for a hotel we were n't all that interested in price ; but more of a relaxing getaway in the heart of downtown. </s>
<s> did some research and and came across the Amalfi Hotel Chicago. </s>
<s> sparked my interest was it 's location and the fact that they offer in room spa treatments. </s>
<s> in Chicago 's river north area ; it is close to the magnificent mile so we can get all of our shopping done while staying relatively close to the hotel and also do some sightseeing along the chicago river on one of many chicago boat tours ; both of which were fantastic ! After a long day out on the town we came back to the hotel to induldge in their in room spa treatments. </s>
<s> wife got the whole works ' facial ; manicure and pedicure ; and hot stone massage therapy ; while i enjoyed a deep tissue massage to get rid of some of the pain from walking around all day ! For dinner we went downstairs and enjoyed a fabulous dinner at Harry Caray 's Italian Steakhouse. </s>
<s> steak I 've ever had ; hands down. </s>
<s> we were finished with dinner we just wanted to go back to our room and relax so we hopped into our comfortable king size bed ; put in a movie with their in room dvd players and beautiful 32 inch HDTV 's. </s>
<s> anyone looking for a nice relaxing getaway to the great city of Chicago ; I would recommend The Amalfi Hotel Chicago to anyone. </s>
<s> offer anything you could ever want in a luxury hotel plus more. </s>
<s> quaint and romantic ; yet masculine. </s>
<s> 've noticed that at most Chicago hotel bars it 's hard to get a drink much less a seat but I guess because it 's a small hotel that was not a problem at the Talbott - plus people take their drinks out to the seating in the lobby because it 's so inviting - cozy and comfortable - love that ! Would love to stay again but I must say that I was surprised by all the comments on the comfortable beds - ours was too firm. </s>
<s> note there is no gym on the premises - but walking and shopping is enough of a workout ! Stayed here in November 2011 on a leisure trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> is very dated ; with some rooms that just are n't good enough. </s>
<s> desk staff was rude. </s>
<s> not be staying here again - prefer the Swissotel and the Hyatt properties ' Regency is similarly priced ; and Park Hyatt is 3x more and a list of boutique hotels in the area as well ' Kimpton ; etc. </s>
<s> : - The only hotel that opens onto Michigan Avenue ; very close to all of the excitement - Eno Wine Bar has a great selection of cheeses - Rooms are clean Cons : - Some hotel rooms just make no sense - our first room was tiny and had a window overlooking a ledge ' effectively no view ; and our second room had two windows that looked out onto a brick wall ' actually no view - You have to pay for everything - internet ; gym ; and the pool ' which was not available due to renovation . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> rooms were very big and luxurious ; everybody was friendly and showed a fabulous display of customer service. </s>
<s> room service always got there when they said it would and it was nice because it was 24 hours so I could get anything whenever I wanted. </s>
<s> price of this hotel for my stay was unbeatable especially because I got great service and I saved a lot compared to the rates of other hotels in the area and their two restaurants were exquisite. </s>
<s> you are ever going to be in the Chicago area and need a hotel to stay in I recommend this hotel ! My experiences with the hotel were not pleasant. </s>
<s> moment we got to our room ; the room was not done. </s>
<s> were missing soaps ; shampoo and towels ; which just goes to show how disorganized the staff was. </s>
<s> hotel had told us that they would bring a trundle bed for the children ; but it took us four calls to the front desk to finally get them to bring it. </s>
<s> restaurant was overpriced for the food ; and selections were limited at breakfast. </s>
<s> place was not kid friendly at all we needed to get a cab to get to the kid friendly attractions ; and there were many conferences going on in the hotel. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel for families. </s>
<s> staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel ; I can honestly say that I will take the time to book a room ; ahead of time ; on my next visit to Chicago. </s>
<s> were thrilled to see how beautiful the hotel was ; at first because it seemed like it would be a nice place. </s>
<s> outside of the hotel was pristine ; but our room was filthy ! We requested a non-smoking room ; but it had obviously been smoked in before ; as you could still smell the stale smoke in the air. </s>
<s> fact ; we were told that the entire hotel was supposed to be non-smoking ; but the hallway smelled like cigarettes as well. </s>
<s> top it off ; room service brought us the wrong item. </s>
<s> we checked out ; we saw that they still tried to chage us for the item ; even after we sent it back. </s>
<s> would also have to point out that Michigan Avenue is a bad spot for a hotel that claims to be so high class. </s>
<s> outside of our hotel were drug dealers and prostitutes. </s>
<s> could n't even go to the gas station after 8 p. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> because I was too scared to leave the hotel. </s>
<s> pool was closed on our first night there because of some convention that the hotel was holding ; thus keeping us from using the hot tub that we were looking forward to. </s>
<s> the price of the room I would say this place was a definite disappointment. </s>
<s> have learned my lesson to check out the room before I agree to stay in it next time. </s>
<s> place gets 1 '2 of a star from me. </s>
<s> hotel is located in an hard to fins location in Chicago ; the dining room for dinner is uncomfortably crowded ; the room service is hard to reach ; overall it was not a pleasant hotel stay. </s>
<s> stayed at this Hotel for 1 night. </s>
<s> just wanted to stay in downtown Chicago. </s>

<s> - For our fifth anniversary ; my husband and I stayed at the Sofitel in Chicago and we absolutely loved it. </s>
<s> the long flight from California ; the thing we needed the most was some quality rest and relaxation. </s>
<s> ; of course ; the Sofitel did deliver. </s>

<s> had such a wonderful time at the Sofitel that we unfortunately did n't have enough time to see the nearby Magnificent Mile or the Hancock Tower. </s>
<s> the end of our stay ; we decided that we will do a proper tour of Chicago the next time we visit the Sofitel. </s>
<s> the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago claims to be an affordable upscale hotel in the heart of Chicago ; it is somewhat expensive ; starting at $ 200 per night. </s>
<s> are very few special discount rates available for the budget conscious traveler. </s>
<s> rooms are modern looking and a little less cozy than one might prefer. </s>
<s> carpeting in the rooms is a little outdated and somewhat dirty in a few areas. </s>
<s> views from the rooms are not as great as they could be. </s>
<s> hotel seems to be understaffed and the heating unit in the room is hard to adjust to the right temperature. </s>
<s> the hotel is located on Chicago 's famous Michigan Avenue ; it is a $ 40 taxi ride from O 'Hare airport and a $ 36 taxi ride from Midway airport ; both rather pricey options. </s>
<s> you chose to drive there ; the valet parking charge is a hefty $ 53. </s>
<s> ; not very budget friendly. </s>
<s> in all ; even though the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago is close to some of the major Chicago attractions ; it is only an average hotel on many levels. </s>
<s> elevator system was impossible. </s>
<s> seems they were trying to improve it but only made it worse. </s>
<s> people waited 15 minutes and some bailed out to the stair wells. </s>
<s> happened several times. </s>
<s> had read about it before booking but guess I did n't take it seriously. </s>
<s> 'd be a deal breaker for any future return unless I heard clearly it was improved. </s>
<s> ; I always think it 's lame that you have to pay extra for WiFi. </s>
<s> recommendations North Michigan Avenue and Lake front areas are best. </s>
<s> Chicago - I recently stayed two nights at the Fairmont while I was in Chicago for a job interview. </s>
<s> hotel was actually just a block from my interview location ; which was super convenient. </s>
<s> room was pretty nice ; clean and with windows that actually opened ! I found an iron and fullsize ironing board in the closet ; which was great because I always forget to ask for those. </s>
<s> think there was an extra fee if you wanted wifi access in your room ; but the lounge downstairs had free wifi and plenty of cozy seating. </s>
<s> a pleasant and convenient experience ; I 'd definitely stay there again. </s>
<s> is best hotel bargin in Chicago if you are not overly unhappy with a small room. </s>

<s> is a great hotel chain that really provides a the sense of escape and fun to all of their hotels. </s>

<s> has a 4 star resturant which we enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere an amazing Italian meal. </s>
<s> wine list is one of the best in a city of great restaurants. </s>
<s> Kimptons have a social hour 5 to 6 with wine at all of their hotels. </s>
<s> sit in a designer ; kind of London circa 1968 couch with a fire place nearby and have that lost art form of relaxation with you fellow guests. </s>
<s> are super animal friendly and provide complete services to your dog if you wish to bring it. </s>
<s> exercise room is great and there is a spa here as well. </s>
<s> are two other Kimptons here but for the money the Allegro is the best value and location. </s>

<s> could not have found a better room for those two nights of peace and quiet. </s>

<s> bathroom was also impressive. </s>
<s> water pressure was not something I had to mess with to get perfect ; and the heater took no time at all to warm up. </s>
<s> though I had brought my own shampoo and conditioner ; I did give the amenities in the bathroom a try ; and like everything else they exceeded my expectations. </s>
<s> did not get a chance to check out the conference rooms ; however ; my husband had nothing but great things to say about the qualities of the facilities. </s>

<s> we arrived the check in process was fairly quick ; however the staff seemed in a bad mood all around. </s>
<s> seemed as if we were taking up their time. </s>
<s> we got to the room we tried to use our personal computer to look for attractions ; and after having to pay $ 10 a day for wifi it was a total waste of money the speed of the internet was extremely slow. </s>
<s> free workout area was also not up to our expectations but since it was free we didnt complain. </s>
<s> we would never stay at this hotel again and we do not recommend it. </s>
<s> entrance and room was spacious and modern ; yet elegant. </s>
<s> was very easy to get around to many places because it is in the middle of all the action of Chicago. </s>

<s>  big shocker for the city in general ! The Hotel Sofitel Chicago Water Tower bills itself as a 4-star luxury hotel ; but the luxury is evidently in the eye of the beholder. </s>
<s> with trite modern art and modular ; cheap-looking furniture that looks straight out of the latest Ikea catalogue ; this 32-floor hunk of glass has to be one of the ugliest hotels I have ever seen. </s>
<s> Urban chic " design does not equal comfort ; the seating and bed furniture are made more for the design floor than for actual use. </s>
<s> service is expensive ; slow ; and the food you eventually do get is mediocre in quality and flavor. </s>
<s> hotel features two bars : the Cafe des Architectes Bar ; and the simply named Le Bar. </s>
<s> French names and trendy modern outfittings do not a good hotel bar make ! Excellent service ; fair prices ; friendly and competent staff are what make a bar great ; none of which you will find at either of these bars. </s>
<s> des Architectes is also a restaurant ; offering " seasonal menus featuring contemporary cuisine with French roots ; " which means small portions and large prices at questionable quality. </s>
<s> the old standby filet mignon did not stand up to its reputation ; coming out a little dry hunk of meat rather than a succulent steak. </s>
<s> this one by ; if you 're looking for a comfortable ; enjoyable stay in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> Water Tower is dry. </s>
<s> ; location ; location. </s>
<s> a great find ! Excellent ; well-run ; small boutique-type hotel on a tree-lined street near all the action without being in the oppressive crunch of it. </s>

<s> great and friendly guy ; but we were waiting for a call back ; not the arrival of a service tech - keep in mind it was late and we were already in bed. </s>
<s> Al was not able to fix the DVD player ; he graciously told us " order a movie on us " - thru the in-house movie selection. </s>

<s> off the architecture and feel of the hotel is just amazing. </s>
<s> beautiful ! The views from our corner suite was breathtaking and the accomodations were flawless. </s>
<s> fact that we could have an apartment like setting rather than a cold hotel room made all the difference. </s>
<s> the big tub in the bath to the entertainment system and work area ; everything is in place to make your stay like being at home but with an awesome view of the Chicago Skyline. </s>
<s> took advantage of the Executive Club for desserts and breakfast and had dinner one night at the Palm restaurant. </s>
<s> food ! We will definitely stay at the Swissotel the next time we visit Chicago. </s>
<s> experience at the Ambassador East Hotel was truly terrible. </s>

<s> hotel was recommended by the wedding party. </s>
<s> was a terrible choice. </s>
<s> the special discount we got because of the wedding ; the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels. </s>
<s> staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children. </s>
<s> kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason. </s>
<s> place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items. </s>
<s> son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart. </s>
<s> ; I would say I was very displeased with the staff ; the hotel 's attitude towards children ; and the expense of the hotel. </s>
<s> the plus side ; our window had an excellent view of the city. </s>
<s> ; I would not return here again. </s>
<s> Affinia is virtually the perfect hotel for a visit to Chicago. </s>
<s> wife and I stayed in an upgraded suite. </s>

<s> hotel was fairly neat. </s>
<s> ; once we got to the room ; and onto the bed ; we found the bed to be noisy. </s>

<s> ; we had to wait half an hour for another room to be cleaned and prepared. </s>
<s> such a well reviewed hotel ; I was highly disappointed with the amount of time I had to spend to get settled into a room. </s>

<s> nearby sucks as most of Chicago or pay 50 for valet to go through your car. </s>
<s> were dusty and gross. </s>
<s> location is notorious for having super sensitive scales on the mini fridge ; so when you barely touch it you 'll get a bill at 3 in the morning under your door. </s>
<s> I been on a higher floor and had a better view it would be a 4 star but not this time. </s>
<s> Chicago - Everything about my stay was fantastic. </s>

<s> to chicago for a week in may ; decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton ; we were not disapointed. </s>
<s> it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level. </s>
<s> had 2 double beds with a bathroom each. </s>
<s> beds and pillows were too die for ; so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles. </s>
<s> the staff were very helpful. </s>
<s> lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful. </s>
<s> 2 blocks away on Harrison is a cafe called " Orange " which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast ; the cafe and the staff are suberb. </s>
<s> a 15 min wait on a sat sun morning. </s>
<s> booked an American Girl Place package at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. </s>
<s> that we 'd have a room with a nice view ; apparently their idea of a nice view is of another building ! Ended up getting a smoking room when we booked non-smoking ; cost us $ 100 more a night than we were told ; and staff was incredibly rude at the restaurant. </s>
<s> never recommend coming here for any reason whatsoever ! I had wanted to stay in this hotel since I had heard about how historic it is and I was highly disappointed with my stay there. </s>
<s> room that I was given was dirty and when I went back to the front desk to inquire about it ; they disregarded my concerns. </s>
<s> took them a very long time to get me a new room and they whole time they were very unprofessional and did not make me feel welcome. </s>
<s> did not stay in the hotel all night since the people in the rooms around mine were unruly and were making noises all night long. </s>
<s> left that night but not before demanding a refund. </s>
<s> went here with the family ; including our dog Marley 'They are very pet friendly. </s>

<s> also seems that it would be a great place to have a wedding or to host an event. </s>
<s> will definately be coming back next time I need to come to chicago definately a fine four star hotel ! We stayed at this hotel with our two teenage daughters duing a part business ; part family fun trip in July. </s>
<s> were very impressed with the location ; within walking distance to great restraunts and shopping ; inlcuding Water Tower Place ' a great mall !. </s>
<s> were quite disappointed with the room cleanlinees and size. </s>
<s> bedspreads were filthy and so thin. </s>
<s> room decor is in dire need of an upgreade. </s>

<s> beware- its cheaper to take a taxi to the airport than the airport shuttle ! Millenium promotes the airport shuttle but take a cab ! I just left the Conrad Chicago and have nothing but good things to say. </s>
<s> used Hilton points to stay there but paid $ 35 'night to upgrade to a junior suite. </s>

<s> never ate in the hotel so I ca n't comment on the food or the prices. </s>
<s> is a Starbucks across the street ' Michigan and an Espresso bar attached to the Nordstrom that is on the ground floor of the hotel. </s>
<s> was very nice to have the little mall right under the hotel. </s>
<s> location of the hotel could not be better. </s>
<s> were walking distance to everything. </s>

<s> will do my best to make sure that future employees of my company do I have to stay here. </s>
<s> the reservation was made ; an early check-in was arranged -- due to travel arrangements ; my travel companion and I were to get to the city in the early hours of the morning. </s>
<s> had arranged an early check-in without having to pay for the night before. </s>
<s> was no fuss raised when we agreed on this and so we assumed it would be fine. </s>
<s> we got there ; however ; there were no rooms available for us for hours and they refused to keep our bags. </s>
<s> were forced to change clothes and wash up in the public restrooms of the office building where our first meeting took place ; and cart our bags around with us. </s>
<s> offered insincere apologies and did n't offer to comp us anything for the inconvenience. </s>
<s> rest of the stay ' one night was nothing to praise. </s>
<s> guess not having bugs would count as positive ? I would definitely never recommend that anyone stay here. </s>
<s> Chicago was a great choice for my wife and I. </s>
<s> could n't resist the elegant Aria Restaurant and the accommodations. </s>

<s> the moment we checked in ; the staff produced a positive atmosphere with genuine hospitality. </s>
<s> wife even suggested we should have had our wedding reception in their beautiful ball room. </s>
<s> ; I would rate Fairmont Chicago a 10 '10 ! After reading good reviews about the Affinia Hotel in Chicago ; my husband and I decided to spend two nights there to celebrate our 30th anniversary. </s>
<s> ; the hotel missed the mark for us. </s>
<s> did not expect to find bedbugs underneath the mattress in a 4-star hotel. </s>
<s> my husband and I have had a bad experience with bedbugs ; as a rule ; we always check underneath the mattress before settling down for the night in any hotel. </s>
<s> I brought this to the attention of the front desk staff ; they practically accused us of planting the bugs there. </s>
<s> was very humiliated and disappointed in the way the situation was handled. </s>
<s> to say ; we made the decision to pack our bags and went elsewhere to celebrate our anniversary. </s>
<s> have written a letter to the hotel chain and hope that they will be more responsive to the situation. </s>
<s> have also reported the incident to my credit card company to alert them that I will be refuting the charge for the one night the Affinia charged to my account because we missed the cancellation deadline. </s>
<s> booked our hotel stay thru Yahoo and requested a room for 4 with 2 beds. </s>
<s> we got to the hotel ; not only did they not have a room for us ' we pre-paid ! ; but they said they could not guarantee what we had requested online ; they could only give us what was available. </s>
<s> hotel staff was rude and condescending and only after I got upset did they finally tell me they did have a room for us. </s>
<s> you book online - beware ! You may not get what you paid for. </s>
<s> did not stand by their promise they advertise in each room. </s>
<s> really enjoyed staying at this hotel. </s>
<s> separated living room and bedroom made it feel like I was renting a nice furnished apartment instead of a hotel room. </s>
<s> kitchen was a comfort since I could prepare a meal for myself if I wished ; and the refrigerator and microwave was a must since I never finish my meals when I go out to eat. </s>
<s> felt more at ease here rather than the detatched feeling I have with most hotels. </s>
<s> would recommend staying at this hotel if you want to feel comfortable and welcome in a sophisticated atmosphere. </s>
<s> traveling in Chicago I stayed at the Sofitel on Chestnut Street. </s>
<s> the hotel was a beautiful and comfortable as the advertisements suggest ; service was severely lacking. </s>
<s> arrived late at night and had one peaceful dreamy nights sleep before being woke up at dawn. </s>
<s> reserved a room on one of the lower floors unaware of the construction happening in the area. </s>
<s> complained that I had not been informed of the construction and requested another room. </s>
<s> complaint was totally disregarded. </s>
<s> was told there were no other rooms in the whole hotel available. </s>
<s> I explained that the noise was bothersome I was treated rudely. </s>
<s> woman at the front desk actually ask me if I thought she could make the workers stop. </s>
<s> understand that the staff has no control over the noise. </s>
<s> did however know about the construction. </s>
<s> I did not have at the time I booked. </s>
<s> that would have swayed my decision. </s>

<s> James Hotel met and exceeded our expectations. </s>
<s> haven of cool ; uncluttered comfort in a hot ; crowded but congenial city. </s>
<s> within steps of some of the greatest art ; architecture ; culinary and cultural opportunities anywhere in North America ; the staff of the James provided us with a home away from home for the week we visited. </s>
<s> check-in was quick and flawless and the king suite a calm ; restorative oasis. </s>
<s> is difficult to over-praise the friendly ; attentive staff ; this is a hotel that truly has its act together ! The day before our visit ended ; we experienced problems with the room 's air conditioner. </s>
<s> the technician was unable to quickly solve the problem ; we were immediately upgraded to a one-bedroom apartment with stunning views of the Chicago skyline. </s>
<s> eagerly await the opening of new James Hotels in other cities. </s>
<s> stayed at the Allegro Hotel while interviewing for a position in Chicago. </s>
<s> read the reviews and they were mixed ; but since the property was suggested by the organization ' due to location ; I booked a room. </s>
<s> to the reviews ; the room was extremely small ; was cold ' the heater blew in cold air in - 2 degree weather ; and just generally uncomfortable. </s>
<s> was no closet so I hung my suit on the doorknob of the door of the adjoining room. </s>
<s> bathroom was extremely small and although tidy ; not especially clean ' it was dusty. </s>
<s> bed ' which was supposed to be a queen but was really a full was quite low and the sheets were hard. </s>
<s> I arrived late ; I ordered room service. </s>
<s> was so little space in the room that the wait staff had to approach the desk 'table sideways. </s>
<s> there is free wireless ' a plus ; I kept getting kicked out of the system and had to ; no lie ; reconnect on-line a record 16 times. </s>
<s> ; to top it all off ; the television stopped working just a little before midnight. </s>
<s> was only there for one evening ' not even 12 hours but that was enough for me. </s>
<s> is supposed to be a 4 star boutique hotel but I 've stayed at better 2 star properties. </s>
<s> the positive side ; the staff is nice and friendly ; the food is reasonably good ; and the lobby is really vibrant. </s>
<s> is a martini bar ' although as I was coming in ; a hotel guest was complaining about it being unsually smokey that looked interesting. </s>
<s> though ; not the best stay I 've had. </s>
<s> wo n't be staying again. </s>
<s> a hotel that touts its luxury location in Chicago the Talbot is very poor ' think Motel 6 at a Hilton price. </s>
<s> is threadbare and the walls are paper thin. </s>
<s> are so worried about the mini-bar they constantly do these random room checks ; so privacy and sleeping in are unheard of. </s>
<s> the prices they charge $ 350. </s>
<s> price for two people. </s>
<s> seems like the money spent on remodeling the exquisite lobby ; which was happening while I stayed ; could have been better spent on better insulation and more up-to-date furnishings for the guest rooms. </s>
<s> I guess the Talbot is more concerned with first impressions than they are returning guests ; which I wo n't be. </s>
<s> room was very pretty ; and the location is great ; but the hotel is so big and they do n't have the staff to take care of everything. </s>
<s> heating in our room was loud ; making it difficult to sleep. </s>

<s> hotel has so many guests that the lobby was too loud to relax in. </s>
<s> did n't get great service at the hotel bar ; and the bar ran out of bar snacks because so many people were in the bar area. </s>

<s> yeah ; we were in a room that looked down at the construction ; we were on the 15th floor and could not hear a sound ; it was very quiet. </s>

<s> were cramped and lacked soap and shampoo ; while the rooms were bare in terms of furniture. </s>
<s> did n't feel like a guest but rather someone who was just being shuffled in and out. </s>

<s> kitchen only featured a microwave and stove top and the bathroom felt more akin to a walk-in closet. </s>
<s> the room sucked I did n't have to stay that much time in it ; it 's only half a block from Magnificient Mile ! This hotel is amazing ; I would recommend everyone to stay at least one night here if they had the chance. </s>

<s> will definitely be back ! When you check into a hotel after being stuck in a airport ; you areusually not in the best of mood. </s>
<s> ; working in a upscale hotel ; do encounter many guests checking in who this has happened to. </s>

<s> a 30 minute ordeal at the front desk they put us in a room with 2 doubles. </s>
<s> room was nice ; nothing specacular ; a little on the small side but nice. </s>

<s> called the desk and asked for some and they said that I could n't have any and that only the maid could come and set up the bed. </s>
<s> husband was ill and I wanted the bed set up so I would n't disturb him. </s>
<s> they were un moved and would n't bring the sheets. </s>
<s> ended up sleeping on the mattress with bath towels over it and another bath towel as a blanket. </s>
<s> could have given me a set of sheets and a blanket ; I did n't pay that much a night to sleep on a bare mattress. </s>
<s> ! Lack of concern for the customer. </s>
<s> had purchased this deal of off groupon. </s>
<s> just say we found a bunch of hidden treasures. </s>

<s> next day i eagerly showed the fronk desk and manager the photos ; and they offered me a $ 68 refund. </s>
<s> was very dissapointed ; and dirty sheets that made us very uncomfortable and sleepless and I broke out on my face with ACNE ' i never had a acne or skin issues im positive something in those dirtyy sheets. </s>
<s> drove 4. </s>
<s> hours to enjoy Chicago and we stayed the hard rock based on reputatuion ; and unfortunitly we were very disspointed. </s>
<s> was DISGUSTING ! I then wrote a Email to management and HEARD NOTHING BACK. </s>
<s> even a response or apology. </s>
<s> just really expected alot more. </s>
<s> here as a treat to myself while in Chicago recently for a concert. </s>
<s> totally LOVED IT here ! When you called either the Front Desk or Room Service ; the phone was answered with " Hallo Mrs ' Name " which was a great personal touch. </s>
<s> at the front desk ; went out her way to help me - storing some things in a safe for me before I could book into my room. </s>
<s> room was wonderful - the bathroom was luxurious. </s>
<s> was on the 30th floor and the views were superb. </s>
<s> ordered room service and it came quickly and the guy was so friendly and nice. </s>
<s> doormen were great too and I wore jeans and a tshirt one day and they still opened the door for me ; so no snobbery there. </s>
<s> ; cozy bathrobes were available in the bathroom ; the lights went on in the wardrobe ' never seen that before ! ; tv was HD ready and flat screen. </s>
<s> bed was like sleeping on a cloud - best sleep for a while. </s>
<s> I stay here again ? ? Oh yeah ! No problem - just need to save up first ! I try to stay at the James every time I happen to be in Chicago. </s>
<s> are other good choices in town ; but nobody has what the James offers : superior service - aka class meets efficiency - ; metropolitan design and comfort with an attention to details I found only at the W in Seoul ; and what always plays a role meaning a convenient location . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
Then they get to you with small unexpected touches that make the difference ie : I was about to take off and drive North ; it was a hot July day . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> one of the staff members handed me a bottle of water. </s>
<s> small gesture. </s>
<s> and appreciated. </s>
<s> management AND the staff understand what we expect and more importantly ; what we need. </s>
<s> they consistenly execute against that. </s>
<s> stayed at the Talbott twice in the last few weeks. </s>
<s> was very pleased with every facet of my stays. </s>
<s> staff ; from doormen to front desk ; to concierge ; to housekeeping ; were wonderful. </s>
<s> rooms were nicely sized and clean ; and well stocked. </s>
<s> will return to the Talbott anytime ! Amalfi Hotel Chicago - I stayed two nights at Amalfi hotel during last weekend. </s>
<s> horrible incident really ruins everything in my trip. </s>
<s> morning I left my leather belt on the bed ; and when I got back after my breakfast ; my leather belt disappeared. </s>
<s> talked with the manager and they said the hotel was not responsible for the lost. </s>
<s> someone went into my room when I went out for breakfast ; and hotel people should be the only people have access to my room. </s>
<s> manager was not helpful and they did n't take the responsibility in this issue. </s>
<s> were friendly ; room was well kept like a typical Hyatt location. </s>
<s> is huge ; with two buildings and over 2000 rooms. </s>
<s> location ; close to Michigan Ave and the subway. </s>
<s> is $ 48 'day. </s>
<s> ! I bid on it on Priceline for $ 59. </s>
<s> were greeted by staff with excellent customer service skills. </s>
<s> room was such a pleasant surprise ; from the flat screen TV ; the full size shower with rain showerhead hand held shower wand ; the wall attached toilet with flushing options ' on the wall ; the comfortable bed ; the lovely lighting options ; etc . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
The size of the room was snug ; and very comfortable ; as would be ; in a historic hotel. </s>
<s> was also quiet ; and I know that the hotel was sold out. </s>
<s> sister was in the room next door. </s>
<s> did not hear her TV. </s>
<s> also loved walking less than a block ; to the shopping and restaurants on North Michigan Avenue. </s>
<s> - I 'm always surprised by the amount of value I get for staying here. </s>
<s> only had to pay $ 279 for the room but the value I get from this room is more than the amount I paid. </s>
<s> room was quite enjoyable to stay in. </s>
<s> 's all the small things that the do correctly that make this hotel superior. </s>
<s> service ' Housekeeping was fast but still handled with class. </s>
<s> amenities were n't too fancy or flashy ; but it just got the job done. </s>
<s> though I have back problems ; the bed was firm enough that it did n't bother my back. </s>
<s> also ordered room service 1 night and got the Roast of lamb. </s>
<s> red wine reduction needed more work ; but all in all it was a nice meal. </s>
<s> best part of this hotel though is its view. </s>
<s> the $ 279 I spent ; I was able to get a room from the 49th floor and the view is just breathtaking. </s>
<s> it being in the center of Chicago ; I was able to see almost all of Chicago from there. </s>
<s> in all ; I would recommend staying here again. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed at the Conrad Chicago on our 1st anniversary tripped and had a WONDERFUL experience thanks to the staff. </s>
<s> only is the hotel and a great location with many places to eat and socialize within walking distance ; but they rooms were also clean and quiet. </s>
<s> staff was helpful and accommodated our requests. </s>
<s> 'll definitely be staying here again next time we visit Chicago ! Also if you stay you MUST eat at The Restaurant. </s>
<s> food ! We stayed at the Ritz Carlton two weeks prior ; and in comparison the Sofitel does not come close. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> get one free ; choose the nicer option ! Pros : Room Service : Quick ! 15 minutes tops. </s>
<s> : Large bathroom with a separate shower and tub. </s>
<s> : Very impressive ; and the doormen are on top of opening the doors and hailing a cab for you. </s>
<s> : Close to the train station and MI Ave. </s>
<s> Cons : NO TOP SHEET ! We asked the others at the conference ; they confirmed . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there is no top sheet. </s>
<s> just sleep with the duvet cover over you. </s>
<s> : - Small ; and not a fan of the modern decor. </s>
<s> Broken closet door ; the bottom track was bent. </s>
<s> the last day my husband removed the closet door completely so I could get to my things. </s>
<s> Barely any storage : closet was teeny tiny anyways ; almost no bigger than a tall locker ; only the top drawers of the nightstands open. </s>
<s> Shower : Horrible water pressure. </s>
<s> The cleaning staff did not replace shampoo ; soap ; etc. </s>
<s> to call the front desk ; and they delivered within 10 mins. </s>
<s> - The cleaning staff did not replace our duvet cover during the three nights we were there ; realized this as I still noticed a stain we made the first night. </s>
<s> made sure not to leave the " save the water " card out. </s>
<s> changed our towels ; but not the bedding ? ? ? - Our room was at the end of the hall across from where the staff enter ; and you could heard that door slam shut all hours of the day. </s>
<s> They charge for Wi-Fi ! - You can change the settings on the tv . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> brightness ; etc. </s>
<s> allegro - I have always had had a good experience with kimpton hotels ; and the allegro in chicago is no difference. </s>

<s> my new fiance told me about his business trip to Chicago I was quite annoyed. </s>
<s> because he insisted I come along. </s>

<s> loved it . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and so did I ! I was so bummed about being all alone for most of the weekend ; but the decor ; wonderful staff and massages made up for it ! I spent my time in the spa and the asian restaurant and could n't have asked for a better experience ! I am definately coming along on the next business trip ! The Swissotel is totally understaffed and lacking any charm or atmosphere. </s>
<s> was clean ; comfortable and had great views but if you wanted to check-in ; use the concierge ; check-out ; or report a problem to the front desk ; forget about it. </s>
<s> booked this place through Priceline. </s>
<s> so I ca n't complain too much as I did n't pay a lot for the room but I have stayed at 4 star hotels in the past as well as another Swissotel. </s>
<s> left a lot to be desired. </s>
<s> minibar fridge in my room did n't work so forget about a cold beer. </s>
<s> ; the internet 'movie 'guest services console did n't work so I had to go to the business office to access the internet. </s>
<s> it was time to checkout the console still was n't working. </s>
<s> 's better than the Holiday Inn but way below expectations for a 4 star hotel After reading some of the most recent reviews I 'm really perplexed. </s>
<s> did n't know what to expect ; but I was most pleasantly surprised. </s>
<s> as all the past reviews ; both negative and positive ; have stated ; you ca n't beat the location of this hotel. </s>
<s> 's perfect. </s>
<s> had a big spacious room in the old tower. </s>
<s> avoided the expensive pitfalls of the hotel extras such as bottled water and items in the room fridge. </s>
<s> beds were great ; the rooms were kept clean and the staff was very friendly. </s>
<s> martinis in the hotel bar. </s>
<s> really ca n't understand the negative reviews. </s>
<s> know you ca n't please everyone ; but in some cases I simply do n't believe their claims. </s>
<s> 've traveled a lot and have stayed in plenty of hotels. </s>
<s> is a great hotel ! Have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted. </s>
<s> Bar ' draught Stella and Guinness which was being upgraded at the end of March when I was last there ; good food ; lovely staff ; large clean rooms ; comfortable beds ; spot on location for the Golden Mile ; Joey 's Pizzas next door are fantastic. </s>
<s> any bad reviews you read about this hotel as the authors must either have been very unlucky or impossible to please. </s>
<s> recommended The Talbott Hotel - Stayed at the Talbott last weekend with some friends ; and it 's fair to say that we were all disappointed in our stay. </s>
<s> of us stayed in a room with two queen beds ; and while we thought it would be enough space for all of us ; it was anything but that. </s>
<s> main room itself actually had a large amount of open floor space ; however ; it was actually too much space given what could 've been provided. </s>
<s> 'd think a room with that much space would have more useful furniture ; like usable table. </s>
<s> only furniture they provided were two arm chairs and two tiny side tables. </s>
<s> four of us were students ; yet not a single one of us could find an acceptable surface with which to do work on ; despite having ample floor space for a desk or table. </s>
<s> room is advertised for 2-4 people ; but the bathroom would not be able to support 3 adults ; let alone four. </s>
<s> was no space to move around the bathroom despite having two sinks ; essentially rendering parallel use in the bathroom absolutely useless. </s>
<s> spacing 'design by the architects. </s>
<s> in-house restaurant was also a bit disappointing ; it felt like all the effort went into the ambiance and decor ; but none went into finding decent chefs ! The table they gave us in the corner of the resturant was a bit cramped as well. </s>
<s> was farther from the University of Chicago than we would 've liked ; but it was aleast close to Washington Square Park. </s>
<s> ; the hotel is decent at best ; especially for the high price they charge. </s>
<s> are probably better options in Chicago ; in my opinion. </s>
<s> family chose to stay at the Chicago Hilton during our last trip to the city. </s>
<s> wanted something luxurious and centrally-located without having to pay exorbitant prices. </s>
<s> can honestly say we made an excellent decision in picking the Hilton. </s>
<s> staff treated us well ; the rooms were clean and roomy ' we loved the Serenity beds ; and the hotel itself is stunning. </s>
<s> was like stepping back in time. </s>
<s> loved that the Chicago Hilton was close to numerous attractions. </s>
<s> weather was lovely ; so it was great to walk to Navy Pier ; Sears Tower ; and the Adler Planetarium. </s>
<s> will definitely stay at the Hilton the next time we are in Chicago. </s>
<s> away from this hotel. </s>
<s> few months back me and my wife decided to get out and have a nice pampered away from home weekend. </s>
<s> at different options for this weekend we decided to go with the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. </s>
<s> claim " Experience the extraordinary " and this sounded great. </s>
<s> we arrived at hotel we were met buy a closed front door and nobody to help with bags. </s>
<s> front desk clerk explained that our room was not yet ready and to goto the bar for some complemenatry drinks. </s>
<s> waiting 2 hours for our room we finally can start to relax. </s>
<s> upon entering room the smell of something horrible is overwhelming . </s>
<s> front desk informed us there was no other rooms and they would bring up some air freshner. </s>
<s> packed our bags and headed over to " x " hotel and were able to get to our pampered weekend away from home. </s>
<s> really wish I could say that I liked this hotel ; but the whole experience was just plain awful. </s>
<s> first warning sign should have been when I made my reservation. </s>
<s> person I spoke with when placing my reservation had absolutely no idea what he was doing. </s>
<s> first he tried to book me into the wrong hotel ; and then when we finally got it sorted which hotel I was actually wanting ; he booked me for the wrong dates. </s>
<s> read me the right dates ; and it was only when I called back two days later to confirm that I found out he 'd given me the wrong dates. </s>
<s> did get it fixed ; but I already had a bad feeling about my stay. </s>
<s> came actually staying at the hotel. </s>
<s> people at the check-in desk were downright rude. </s>
<s> there was the room. </s>
<s> was supposed to be in a non-smoking room ; but the room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. </s>
<s> hotel staff refused to believe me ; but did let me change rooms to one that did n't smell of cigarettes. </s>
<s> ; I might as well have stayed in the first room. </s>
<s> was short towels ; and it took four calls 'over a period of 12 hours to the front desk to get some. </s>
<s> sheets had not been changed ; made obvious by the crumbs and fresh stains that littered them. </s>
<s> ; I was able to get fresh sheets ; but like the towels ; it took several hours for them to be delivered. </s>
<s> this is a pet friendly hotel ; lucky me I got stuck in the room next to the room filled with yappy little dogs. </s>
<s> walls were so paper thin ; all I could hear all night was barking. </s>
<s> I complained about it ; the staff refused to believe me ; and said that the walls of the room are so thick I should n't be able to hear anything from next door. </s>
<s> right. </s>
<s> was excited to use the pool ; but just like my room ; it had n't been cleaned recently. </s>
<s> ; I tried the fitness center. </s>
<s> the equipment was broken. </s>
<s> tried to cut my stay short ; but of course this hotel would n't work with me at all. </s>
<s> even refused to comp my stay for all the grossness I had to deal with. </s>
<s> will never stay with Hilton again ; and I will be sure to let everyone know what a nightmare this stay was. </s>
<s> husband and I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for our wedding anniversary - and what a pleasant stay we had ! From the first moment we walked in ; we were overwhelmed at the classy elegance of the lobby. </s>
<s> casually mentioned that it was our anniversary ; and after we came back from dinner ; we found champagne and strawberries awaiting us in the room. </s>
<s> staff was professional but friendly ; and made us feel so welcome. </s>
<s> room was immaculate ; the furnishings were so plush - we did n't really want to go home ! Room service was prompt ; and the views were spectacular ! We are definitely going to make this visit a yearly repeat. </s>
<s> James Chicago - The hotel was awesome and its location was fantastic. </s>
<s> really loved the service and the staff was very friendly. </s>
<s> were unlimited bath products ; bath robes ; free wifi and a great gym. </s>
<s> was glad to see good vegetarian options and the one I had was pretty delicious. </s>
<s> will certainly stay there again ! I was lucky enough to get a " 4 star " hotel off of Priceline for $ 70 - I was luckier that I got the Knickerbocker ! From check in to check out the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. </s>
<s> rooms are small but cozy. </s>
<s> reading the reviews from other guests I was somewhat scared of what I would find - they must have stayed at a different hotel. </s>
<s> am a very frequent traveler and felt that the rooms and the hotel met the " 4 star " rating. </s>
<s> ; the rooms and bathrooms were small ; but what historic hotel in a big city is n't ? The decor and quality met my expectations. </s>
<s> lobby and bar were very inviting. </s>
<s> ; I would stay here again and again. </s>
<s> wife and I went to Chicago to enjoy our weekend and stayed at Hyatt Regency. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago has ruined our family holiday weekend. </s>
<s> of all ; if you are not a diamond or platinum member ; you need to reserve the room atleast 10-15 days in advance. </s>
<s> have to pay extra $ 20 for the welcome credit option. </s>
<s> will give you a credit of $ 75 for the 2 days. </s>
<s> only used $ 20 and the rest was forefeited. </s>
<s> talked to the manager and he said we ca n't use it on our next visit. </s>
<s> management of the hotel is full of cheap minded people. </s>
<s> you know most of the hotels let you use their wi-fi for free ; Hyatt Regency management asked us to pay for using their wi-fi. </s>
<s> of this place ; if you want to enjoy your weekend in Chicago ; Hyatt Regency should be the last place you should consider staying. </s>

<s> St Journal or USA Today is not complimentary. </s>

<s> Ambassador East Hotel ; located in downtown Chicago ; is one of the BEST hotels I 've ever stayed in. </s>
<s> wife and I went into the city on a weekend getaway and found the Ambassador East on a hotel booking website. </s>
<s> rates are very ; very reasonable for the high class and luxury that they provide. </s>
<s> was pleased to know that they allow pets as we decided to go into the city last minute and could n't find anyone to watch our dog for the weekend. </s>
<s> was more than pleased with the friendly staff and felt like their hotel put an extra emphasis on knowing their customer ; which is nice because most places in Chicago are very impersonal. </s>
<s> in all i was very pleased with our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in the downtown area. </s>
<s> '5 Stars. </s>
<s> recently completed our first visit to Chicago and were pleasantly surprised by the Affinia Chicago hotel where we stayed. </s>
<s> hotel has gone to great lengths to offer extra services to their guests ; including individual pillow choices ; complimentary kits with items designed to enhance the city visit ; and fine dining in two on-site restaurants ; one of them roof-top with amazing city views. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. </s>
<s> over Memorial Weekend for 2 nites ; 2 rooms. </s>
<s> Hotel ; we always love breakfast in morning ; and drinks in even when applicable. </s>
<s> the corner from magnificent Mile ; and close to lots of restaurants. </s>
<s> was great ; we even checked in early before noon ; and other room available less than hour later. </s>
<s> fruit was available to us ; and bell guys are cool. </s>
<s> are on small side compared to other homewoods but no complaints here ; house cleaning kept our room clean ; and we felt safe ! Upon entering Homewood Suites ; I was greeted by incredibly friendly staff and my breath was taken by the beauty of the hotel. </s>
<s> I saw my room ; I was immediately relieved because it provided all of the amenities needed for my week-long business stay ' refrigerator ; microwave ; stove ; dishwasher ; flat panel TV. </s>
<s> of all ; the hotel has an on-site fitness center where I was able to work off all of the extra calories I consumed during the delicious complimentary breakfast. </s>
<s> could n't resist their omelettes ! The hotel is in the heart of Chicago and I must say ; the city view from my room was priceless. </s>
<s> recommended ! No excuse for a hotel like this to have cold showers on three consecutive days and then to tell customer that engineering will look at it and that we should have told them sooner. </s>
<s> would n't expect a cold shower at a budget hotel ; let alone an Omni. </s>
<s> location and the bar is nice. </s>
<s> Omni Chicago Hotel offers all the great amenities in comfort that is expected of a luxury hotel ; particularly speedy and easy wireless internet access and nice-sized plasma tv 's. </s>
<s> windows are big enough to give a spectacular view of the city skyline while reclining on a great sofa in a comfortable and luxurious living room ; before sleeping in a king-sized bed of either feather or foam pillows ; which is particularly relaxing after taking a bath or shower in the spacious bathroom. </s>

<s> ; the vast fitness center is just as worthy to use ; as well as the whirlpool ; Jacuzzi and the indoor swimming pool. </s>
<s> is an easy activity to achieve via the two rooftop sundecks. </s>
<s> nice aspect that is n't so common to find is the ability to have small pets stay with you in the hotel. </s>

<s> stayed here because of the enthusiastic positive reviews on Trip Advisor and Yelp. </s>

<s> a positive note ; the tea from room service tasted delicious ; employees were abundant and friendly ; the location is great ; and it 's very easy to get a taxi. </s>
<s> the future ; I would reluctantly stay here for business. </s>
<s> would not stay here for pleasure. </s>

<s> chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. </s>

<s> I stepped into my room ; I soon found that everything in the room was not cleaned up. </s>

<s> really recommend the hotel. </s>
<s> LOVED it. </s>
<s> ONLY problem we had was with the David Burke Steakhouse. </s>
<s> service was horrible ; they switched our order with the table next to our 's and the only compensation was they took off a $ 7 side dish we ordered ' and they were nice enough to NOT charge us for the other side dish we DID N'T get. </s>
<s> N'T go there. </s>

<s> would not hesitate at all to stay at Sofitel Water Tower Place next time I 'm in Chicago ; in fact I look forward to my next visit. </s>
<s> service was only subpar and then rooms needed better cleaning. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> did n't go to the city for the hotel room. </s>

<s> 've stayed in quite a few hotels in the downtown area and none have ever impressed me more than this one. </s>
<s> will definitely be staying there again on our next trip into the city. </s>
<s> Fairmont Chicago-Do n't waste ' all ! your money at the Fairmont ! We checked in after an exhausting day of travelling and the concierge staff were extremely rude and condescending to myself ; my wife ; and my daughters. </s>
<s> make matters worse ; construction and street noise from outside was so bad ' on the 12th floor ; no less ! that we all had trouble getting to sleep despite a day of travel. </s>
<s> awakening ; we discovered that the toiletries provided were not only far too small for a family of four ; but also so low-quality that I could have mistaken them for CVS generics. </s>
<s> saving grace of this hotel is its location -- at least we were within walking distance of all the museums we came here to see. </s>
<s> unfortunately stayed for 3 nights at the Knickerbocker Hotel . </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> I pulled the bed away from the bedhead and watched as little rice sized brown bugs scurried over the white sheets . </s>

<s> " 
When I arrived at the hotel at 11 : 45pm I was told they did n't have a room for me and that I 'd have to move to the Four Points Sheraton which they paid for. </s>
<s> was a major inconvenience to have to move and completely unacceptable that my confirmed room was given away. </s>
<s> was told that they overbooked and did n't get as many cancellations as they expected. </s>

It was nice that they did have fruit. </s>
<s> think that once the kinks are worked out that this will be a great hotel -- they just need to get the basics down ! My friend and I visited Amalfi Hotel last week when we were in Chicago and found it to be a great place ; very sophisticated and luxurious ; with lots of attention to detail in the decor and wonderful customer service. </s>

<s> was a wonderful experience being at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> am eager to visit there again. </s>
<s> stayed here for one night ; and found it a hotel that concentrates on conferences rather than your normal guest. </s>
<s> found it hard to get a room in the city for that particular night and so we paid above the odds for this - $ 200 for the night. </s>
<s> felt when we checked in that if you were n't with the conference ; then why were we staying in the hotel. </s>
<s> guy at the main door did n't even hold it open when you are trying to lug your bags into the lobby ; we then had to que for 15-20 minutes just to check in. </s>
<s> were not given any information about the hotel and when I rang down to reception at one stage to find out if there was a business centre in the hotel that I could access the Internet through ; I was just short of being asked why did n't I bring my lap-top with me so I could use the Internet access in the room . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
! I found the staff very rude and not helpful at all and would not recommend this hotel for a tourist. </s>
<s> location ; clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay. </s>
<s> in an area with plenty of stores The Mile and restaurants. </s>
<s> lobby is on the 6th floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall I would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family ; friends or on business. </s>
<s> subway to Wrigley is a 1 '2 block away from the front door. </s>
<s> arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from California. </s>
<s> did n't know about the renovation when I made the reservations ; but that did n't bother me very much. </s>
<s> was helped by a man at the front desk named Ben ; who was friendly enough ; but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay. </s>
<s> gave me NO information about anything. </s>
<s> had no idea where breakfast was served ; or even if there WAS breakfast. </s>
<s> was also an EXTREMELY unpleasant woman working behind the desk 'she was n't wearing a name tag but was African American ; slim with short hair who seemed to be actually radiating hostility. </s>
<s> made me very uncomfortable and needless to say ; made me feel unwelcome. </s>
<s> actually felt like I was putting her out by staying in the hotel. </s>
<s> encountered her again the next morning when I had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit ; and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness. </s>
<s> also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners. </s>
<s> matter what may be going on in one 's life ; when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile. </s>
<s> was appalled by her demeanor. </s>
<s> room was alright ; there was no clock which I found very odd. </s>
<s> I came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and I was constantly confused as to which one was correct ; especially upon waking up in the morning. </s>
<s> would have been nice to have a clock. </s>
<s> was also no literature on local sites ; maps ; restaurant menus ; or even anything with the hotel 's name and address in the room. </s>
<s> ; the mattress was the absolute worst mattress I 've ever slept on in my life. </s>
<s> woke up every morning with a sore back and neck. </s>
<s> 've had better sleep on a hard ; lumpy futon. </s>
<s> was absurd. </s>
<s> another person posted ; my tub did not drain either ; and I was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found. </s>
<s> they were around somewhere ; but I was n't made aware of it at check-in ; and I did n't want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like I was a burden to the employees. </s>
<s> hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance ; but I absolutely would not stay here again. </s>
<s> 've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel ; which was a bummer because it was my first visit to Chicago and I had pretty high expectations. </s>
<s> had heard good things about the Ambassador East and decided to stay there on vacation with my husband -- what a mistake ! First off ; they charge for being able to use the internet ; which should be a given these days ; especially for how much you pay for the room. </s>
<s> " champagne " was cheap ; I could have spent $ 15 to get my own bottle. </s>
<s> King room was just as small as a double room anyway. </s>
<s> bed was really hard ; and crudely made. </s>
<s> there was someone new on the staff that did n't know how to make a bed ; but besides that ; the sheets were starched to military stiffness. </s>
<s> was so uncomfortable ! When I asked if we might get some new sheets ; the staff were so incredibly rude and told me I was basically stuck with what I had because they 're " all that way " . </s>
<s> was appalled ! Anyway ; we gave it a shot and stayed there that night ; in the mediocre luster of the room design. </s>
<s> did n't sleep well and did n't particularly enjoy ourselves ; especially because apparently there was a wedding going on in the building because we could hear the party ! I mean ; talk about the opposite of peaceful ! Again ; we tried appealing to the staff to have our room moved away from the party ; but they said they could n't move us because of the romance package. </s>
<s> a jip ! After the kind of " fun " we 'd had ; we realized we could n't handle anymore. </s>
<s> called for a manager the next morning and fought with him for a couple hours. </s>
<s> wanted to just cancel the second night of our stay ; and he said he 'd do that ; but that we 'd still be charged a percentage of it ! After telling him everything that had happened and how displeased we were ; we finally got him to not charge us and left to go stay at another hotel that was actually relaxing. </s>
<s> East - I had a really bad experience at this hotel. </s>
<s> stayed here with my girlfriend during Christmas and their bed was horrible. </s>
<s> made some creaking noise and when we complained about this to the reception ; they said that they could not do anything about it. </s>

<s> My stay at this hotel was rather miserable to say the least. </s>
<s> the service was timely ; the amenities were simply not up to par. </s>
<s> ; the two queen beds in the room were in decrepit condition. </s>
<s> ; they only had two small pillows on each bed. </s>
<s> had to request more. </s>
<s> bathroom was small and it took us forever to locate the hair-dryer ; which turned out to be in the closet ' which makes no sense. </s>
<s> suppose the TV was nice ; but we have a nice TV at home. </s>
<s> the worst of all was the lack of a pool. </s>
<s> other hotels in the area offer a nice pool ; which I believe are a staple of any good hotel. </s>
<s> breakfast was cold and bland. </s>
<s> ; they stopped service early ; which was disappointing since they really should adhere to the times that they posted. </s>
<s> ; my stay was not up to snuff and I would certainly look for a different hotel next time we go to Chicago. </s>
<s> Hotel Allegro located in the Chicago Loop ; provided my wife and I with one of the worst hotel experiences in recent memory. </s>
<s> ordered the weekend Liquid Therapy package 48 hours prior as noted on their website ; but to our surprise when we arrived ; our names were nowhere to be found in their system ! No room ; no accommodations at the restaurant ; nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot. </s>
<s> weekend away turned into the weekend from hell when we were asked to take a smaller room than I originally booked ; and never did they offer us a replacement dining option ! I have a receipt and credit card statement that shows our reservations being made on time. </s>

<s> of Hyatt were very friendly and helpful ; other than the failure to deliver the reserved room. </s>

<s> THREE consecutive nights. </s>
<s> was simply inadequate soundproofing - even 14 floors above the street ' OK - 13 floors as there is no 13th floor. </s>

<s> was one of the best times we ever had in Chicago. </s>
<s> considering several hotels in the area ; my family and I finally decided ; unfortunately ; on Homewood Suites ; for our long weekend vacation. </s>
<s> ; the experience left much to be desired. </s>
<s> breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries. </s>
<s> linens on one of our beds seemed dirty ; and when I told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced ; the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude. </s>
<s> would not come back here ever. </s>
<s> Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago - I must say ; I was disappointed with my stay here. </s>
<s> 'm currently on crutches due to a recent foot injury and was hoping to get a room close to the elevator. </s>
<s> guess most of the rooms were unavailable ; but the man at the front desk was very rude to me when he explained they were unable to make special accommodations. </s>
<s> I am supposed to be clairvoyant and make such requests in advance. </s>
<s> ; to get to my room I had to make a right out of the elevator and walk down a hallway ; turn left and walk down another hallway ; and turn left again and walk down yet another hallway. </s>
<s> room itself was nothing special. </s>
<s> had trouble sleeping due to poor air circulation and a stiff mattress. </s>
<s> bathroom was also just okay and on the smaller side. </s>
<s> of the bathroom lights was burnt out and it took them 3 DAYS to replace the bulb ! Needless to say I was not impressed and would not recommend this place. </s>
<s> - We just came back from a trip to Chicago where we stayed at the hotel for two nights. </s>
<s> just wanted to explore Chicago area so we picked this hotel because it has easy access to public transports ' bus ; subway ; airport. </s>
<s> is well until we were shown our room. </s>
<s> we made a reservation we insists on having the room with lake view. </s>
<s> got the exact opposite. </s>
<s> raised the issue and got to talk with the manager who like his subordinate is less than willing to listen to our concern and we had to give up. </s>
<s> next complaint is the bathroom. </s>
<s> would you need the bathroom to be that big ? ? We brought some friends in Chicago over to hang out and we were jam-packed in the bedroom and it feels very small while the bathroom is virtually empty. </s>
<s> use of space. </s>
<s> restaurant at the first glance seems nice with cozy big red sofa and high ceiling and has a nice selection of menu. </s>
<s> problem is when the food actually got served. </s>
<s> was unbelievably cold as if it 's prepared in advance. </s>

The James Chicago-My wife and I had an excellent stay at the James. </s>
<s> stayed at one of their marvelous 1 bedroom apartments which were much more affordable than we expected. </s>
<s> wife loved that there was a wet bar and that the bathroom was so large. </s>
<s> enjoyed that the living room was separate from the bedroom so that I could watch TV late at night while she slept. </s>
<s> was clean and well kept ; I would recommend it highly. </s>
<s> - Last week my family stayed at the Monaco for two nights while visiting my brother in Chicago. </s>
<s> we went in not knowing what to expect ; going off the suggestion of a friend ; we were pleasantly surprised at the amenities the hotel provided. </s>
<s> rooms were very spacious ; with plenty of furniture to lounge around with your kids. </s>
<s> bathrooms were kept clean and the staff helped us out with figuring our way around the city. </s>
<s> are frequent shuttles to and from O 'Hare ; so getting there was a breeze too. </s>
<s> also recommend seeing a show at the Chicago Shakespeare theater while you 're staying ; since its not too far from the hotel. </s>
<s> - Stayed here for a week and loved it. </s>
<s> room was on fifth floor which has a great view. </s>
<s> pleasant staff ; big rooms and bathrooms. </s>

<s> - I was very disappointed by the Amalfi Hotel. </s>
<s> hotel is inconvieniently situtated ; far from public transportation. </s>
<s> you do n't bring a car ; you will need to take expensive taxis if you actually want to do anything in Chi town. </s>
<s> the flip side ; the rooms are decent ; and the food was good ; though not enough to offset the location. </s>
<s> a disappointment. </s>
<s> a quaint ; warm and friendly place to stay ! Very accomodating . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> had 2 dble beds and bathroom was fine . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> a bit small compared to USA hotels . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but compared to european travel . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the place was palatial ! Would def. </s>
<s> stay here again. </s>
<s> is great too ! Whatever you do ; do NOT stay at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> made that mistake ; and it was terrible ! The bed linens were obviously not clean - there was even a stain on the comforter - and the housekeeping staff there absolutely did not care about doing a good job. </s>
<s> room was only " cleaned " twice in a week 's stay ; and even then only the barest minimum of effort seemed to go into it. </s>
<s> did n't even empty the trash cans ! As for the " in-suite " kitchen ; it was awful. </s>
<s> were hoping to save money by cooking in our room ; but with one broken eye on the stove and a nasty ; greasy microwave ? It seemed a better idea to eat out ; and avoid any more unpleasant surprises from their lackluster in-house food. </s>
<s> did n't hear good things about their breakfast offerings ; anyways. </s>
<s> I were you ; I 'd avoid this place like the plague. </s>
<s> know I 'm certainly never going back ! The Palmer House Hilton was recommended to me by a friend who had visited Chicago the previous summer. </s>
<s> was very happy with the location ; and was able to visit the nearby Lake Michigan and Millennium park ' beautiful !. </s>
<s> rooms were good size ; and the right amount of luxury for the price. </s>
<s> did n't use room service much ; but when I did everything was in order. </s>
<s> husband and I came to the Ambassador East Hotel for my sister 's wedding. </s>
<s> hotel had been very helpful and professional in helping us coordinate a wedding with over 200 guests. </s>
<s> we arrived we were impressed by how organized they were ; helping us check and get our guests situated. </s>
<s> were even nice enough to let us leave guest gift bags in each of our guest 's rooms. </s>
<s> rooms were clean and beautifully appointed ; with a view of the city. </s>
<s> held the rehearsal dinner 'groomsman party in the pump room which has a gorgeous bar complete with celebrity photos on the wall. </s>
<s> my sister was married in a church downtown ; we held the reception in the large banquet hall. </s>
<s> the hotel was great about shuttling all of our guests and helping us arrange dinner ; the DJ and all of the wedding 's decorations. </s>
<s> had a great time. </s>
<s> East Hotel is highly recommended ! I got a Sunday night stay for only $ 50 off of Priceline. </s>
<s> ; so it would be hard to complain . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but this was truly a great hotel ; even if I paid double. </s>
<s> first impression you get when you walk through the sliding doors of the Hyatt Regency Chicago is WOW. </s>
<s> lobby is beautiful with a upscale mall type of look to it with an open area that has a restaurant ; plenty of couches ; seats etc to people watch and a lake with water fountains. </s>
<s> take the escalator to the concierge 'directory 'check in area. </s>
<s> hotel let me check in at 12pm ' I had a 3pm check in time. </s>
<s> suggest you call ahead like I did so they know you are coming early. </s>
<s> women at the desk was friendly and when I requested a higher level floor she was more than happy to look it up and even told me " I have a room on the 18th floor with a veiw of the river or you can go higher with no view " . </s>
<s> thought it was pretty nice to give me that information so that I wouldnt get stuck with a room with a view of a wall. </s>
<s> rooms are big ' I had a doubles room The beds were beautiful with great pillows ; blankets ; headboards etc. </s>
<s> Ipod alarm clock was a nice 21st century touch to the room. </s>
<s> to plug in your ipod ; listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of touring Chicago. </s>
<s> view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries. </s>
<s> great feature is the concierge area 's computers that gives you access to printing your boarding pass before you get to the airport. </s>
<s> simply look at the screen ; click on your airline icon and following the instructions. </s>
<s> had my boarding passes in about a minute. </s>
<s> in handy when I got to OHare and was able to skip a long line of frustrated passengers. </s>
<s> was only in the hotel for 1 day ; but it was by far one of the better hotel experiences I have had and I travel alot. </s>
<s> is a business hotel ; but definitely a great choice for families and couples. </s>
<s> would stay here again when Im passing through Chicago. </s>
<s> - There are some hotels that you should avoid and this is one of them. </s>
<s> I specified a non-smoking room ; the stench of cigarettes assaulted me as I entered. </s>
<s> complaining ; I was put in another room. </s>
<s> took almost an hour as the front desk was understaffed and I had to wait in line. </s>
<s> still ; the room I was transferred to had a broken TV. </s>
<s> this time ; I was too tired to complain and simply went to bed. </s>
<s> least the bathrooms were clean ; although I thought the bed smelled a bit weird. </s>
<s> could n't sleep well at all though due to the noise from the street. </s>
<s> a terrible experience. </s>
<s> Chicago Hotel My family stayed here for a quick ; half-week vacation last month. </s>
<s> booked through Travelocity ; and got a good deal ' for the quality ; a bit over $ 200 a night. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> rooms are - big- ; it felt a bit wasteful getting a second room for my 2 daughters ; but they loved it and had a blast. </s>
<s> rooms are well furnished and well maintained ; and the height of the hotel gives a great view over surrounding buildings. </s>
<s> ate at the restaurant for one meal and have to say it had a good selection ' try the braised beef ; but eat out cause theres so much within 2 blocks of the hotel. </s>
<s> ; head down to the Navy Pier if you have the time. </s>
<s> hotel will drive you ; and the painted glass museum impressed me ; let alone the kids. </s>
<s> only regret is that we did n't stay longer ! Fun times ; and a good hotel. </s>
<s> - I had a reservation at the allegro in chicago ; and this was honestly the worst reservation I have ever made. </s>
<s> rooms were small ; had an odor ; and the location was far away from chicago 's otherwise convenient public transit. </s>
<s> your stay somewhere else if you can. </s>
<s> you 're standing in a craptastic excuse for a shower buttnaked and cold with soap in your hair because the water from the shower head has gone from a weak spray to a dribble to nothing coming out at all ; nothing in the world will ever convince you to stay here again. </s>
<s> worst part is that the hotel knows this is a problem ' they told me that it happens to the upper floors ; and I was n't even staying on the highest floor ! as if that makes it ok. </s>
<s> can look past the " rustic " decor of the room and take it for what it is - an inexpensive place to crash ; but c 'mon ; a girl 's gotta shower. </s>
<s> you just ca n't find fault with a hotel ; even if you tried. </s>
<s> was the case with Sofitel ; where we 'd never stayed before. </s>
<s> 's a sleek ; modern ; sophisticated hotel with European touches. </s>
<s> spent three days there on a leisure weekend ; we had a 29th floor king room looking directly at the Hancock Building ; at a total cost including taxes and lugs of about $ 165 a night. </s>
<s> room was average sized ; well-appointed ; everything in it worked ; and it had a fabulous view of the Chicago high-rise jungle ; including snippets of the lake. </s>
<s> public areas were wonderfully decorated. </s>
<s> restaurant served a good breakfast at ; for Chicago ; reasonable prices. </s>
<s> staff was excellent. </s>
<s> wife broke her ankle several weeks before we visited and was on crutches. </s>
<s> staff loaned us a wheelchair and was very helpful in assisting her. </s>
<s> hotel is excellently situated for visiting The Art Institute or Millennium Park. </s>
<s> is an " old classic " of a hotel ; and the main lobby is a must see ; but I would not stay there again. </s>
<s> problem with any hotel dating from long ago ' the current one was built in 1923-25 is that ; even with extensive remodeling ' which was done in 2007-2009 it is hard to create spaces that are comparable to what is expected today ' in many cases the walls are load bearing so can not be changed too much. </s>
<s> had a reasonably sized room ' king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries. </s>
<s> ; there was no coffee machine in the room - something I have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days. </s>
<s> major complaint about this stay was the Executive Lounge. </s>
<s> is usually worth while to pay the extra for access - in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors d 'oeuvres in the evening along with a modest wine at a modest price. </s>
<s> Since we are currently at the diamond level in the Hilton Honors program ; we get access for free at the Hiltons but I usually upgrade at other chains such as the Hyatt. </s>
<s> '
At the Palmer Executive Lounge I ordered a couple of glasses of wine ' there was a bartender on duty and was slightly surprised by the cost - $ 9 'glass which came to $ 21. </s>
<s> for two with tax and tip - and was even more surprised by the wine. </s>
<s> was about the worst wine I had tasted in many years. </s>
<s> did n't think it was even as good as Trader Joe 's cheapest $ 2. </s>
<s> wine that I tried a couple of weeks ago. </s>
<s> I did n't get a look at the bottle to see what it was ' although I did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard. </s>
<s> noticed that a couple of groups in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in - and I can understand iot at the prices they were charging. </s>
<s> then occurred to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time. </s>
<s> checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red wines by the glass - the same three varietals as at the bar. </s>
<s> cabernet was a William Hill at $ 10. </s>
<s> 'glass from room service. </s>
<s> presume that what I had had at some time been a William Hill that had been left to turn to vinegar. </s>
<s> was slightly more expensive from room service ; but I hope that it was in a lot better condition. </s>
<s> the James was once considered an elegant ; chic establishment ; it has lost its luster. </s>
<s> small rooms are filled with cheap Ikea type furnishings ; Our tiny bathroom flooded with water that escaped the shower curtain. </s>
<s> and flushings from neighboring rooms sounded more like protective levies collapsing. </s>
<s> 2 small elevators could not handle the guests ; and many of us were forced to walk down several flights of stairs rather then wait for extended periods of time. </s>
<s> thin windows could not contain street noise and sidewalk conversations were heard throughout the night. </s>
<s> was rather provocative to listen to the couple next door carousing ; but also rather tacky unsettling. </s>
<s> took more then 30 minutes for the valet to bring our car after we checked out. </s>
<s> hotel has lost it and the James sysndicate will have a difficult time competing in New York 's Soho when they try to open in September. </s>
<s> Yorkers will not tolerate shabby incompetence. </s>
<s> points : 1. </s>
<s> guess they gave me the worst room. </s>
<s> 's small room with a king size bed even though I 'd requested a room with two queen beds. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> roll away bed was available so I had to sleep on the floor. </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> point : 1. </s>
<s> location. </s>
<s> have recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel and although I have stayed there a variety of times before ; for both business and pleasure ; my experience this time was particularly poor. </s>
<s> right when I checked in to the day I left I felt like I was constantly around unfriendly people who did n't want to be at work their to do their jobs. </s>
<s> room was dirty the whole time even though the maid came every day ; and when I was trying to sleep at night it was so loud in the hallways ; I could n't sleep. </s>
<s> my next visit to Chicago I wo n't be staying at the Hyatt Regency. </s>
<s> visiting the Chicago area ; we chose the Hotel Monaco Chicago for our stay. </s>
<s> one of the premier luxury hotels in Chicago ; we held high expectations but were quickly disappointed in what we recieved. </s>
<s> problems began as soon as we arrived. </s>
<s> attendant was not friendly nor did she have the smile that is suppose to be the symbol of Kimpton. </s>
<s> ; when we went to our room only to discover that we had not been given what we had paid for ; the situation only got worse. </s>
<s> than apologize for the error ' my credit card receipt was on hand we were blamed for the indescrpencies in rooms and told that not only was the room we had reserved and paid for more than two months unavailable ; we would not recieve a refund of the price difference of the two rooms. </s>
<s> could not believe that a top 40 U. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> hotel that is suppose to be committed to excellence could make such a blunder ! With no choice but to retreat back to our room ; we were pleasantly pleased with all of the amenities that we did recieve during our stay. </s>
<s> beautiful hotel in the Chicago Loop ; but do n't go expecting to be treated with respect or professionalism. </s>
<s> wife and I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago and ; after our experience there ; we will not be returning. </s>
<s> a hotel that markets itself as " luxury ; " we were expecting to get a big bang for our buck. </s>
<s> were disappointed ; to say the least. </s>
<s> of all ; we stayed in the King Deluxe room and it was uncomfortably small. </s>
<s> space was used poorly - my wife and I could not walk around the bed at the same time because there was so little space. </s>
<s> decor seemed rather dated and not of the best quality. </s>
<s> they said our room woudl be ready at 3 ; we had to wait almost an hour past that for our room to be ready. </s>
<s> the staff did offer a complimentary drink as an apology ; they did n't seem terribly upset or apologetic about the inconvenience this caused. </s>
<s> noise at night from the city is horrible - even with the radio on in our room we could hear traffic and pedestrians on the street well past midnight. </s>
<s> hotel would not move us to a different room. </s>
<s> in all ; I felt that we paid $ 100. </s>
<s> for a luxury hotel and got a $ 40 Motel 6. </s>
<s> will definitely not be back anytime soon. </s>
<s> traveled to Chicago to visit with our daughter who lives in the city. </s>
<s> our suprise what once was a lovely older hotel is now under major renovations. </s>
<s> is the lobby and gusts are required to walk down to the basement to get the one . </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  elevator that is working to the second floor to register. </s>
<s> first room was recently renovated . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> stark white walls ; no amenities at all. </s>
<s> had to enter the room and find their way to the bed to turn on the light to the room. </s>
<s> furniture includes a bed that is close to the groud ; a cold blck slab functioning a a desh and metal chair. </s>
<s> fride ; coffee maker ; iron ; or even a picture on the stark white walls. </s>
<s> asked to change our room and then were put in one of the older suites on the 15th floor. </s>
<s> this room was attractive ; we were greeted to jack hammers at 8 every morning. </s>
<s> staff were all very nice but the accommodations were lacking. </s>
<s> shore drive I read the reviews on Trip Advisor for this property which had it ranked as ' 1 in Chicago. </s>
<s> got a king room overlooking Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> view was beautiful. </s>
<s> room was also impeccable. </s>
<s> and bright ; very fresh and modern. </s>
<s> find it very hard to fault any Sofitel 's. </s>
<s> service ; attentiveness of staff ; cleanliness and luxury are always top notch. </s>
<s> was great ; head left from the lobby and you reach a bunch of european style cafe 's and restaurants. </s>
<s> ahead of the hotel on Michigan Ave is a shoppers paradise. </s>
<s> great place to stay ; and much better value than Park Hyatt. </s>
<s> do find some of the charges in luxury hotels to be a bit crazy ; such as for the internet. </s>
<s> you are paying top dollar ; a few inclusions would be nice. </s>
<s> House A Hilton Hotel - The Palmer House is a terrible place to stay at. </s>
<s> the hotel may look nice ; the food is horrible ! During my first night 's stay ; I tried to take a bath in my room 's bathroom and saw a spider crawl out from underneath the faucet. </s>
<s> will never stay here again ! My $ 200 Gucci sunglasses were stolen out of my bag on the 16th. </s>
<s> filed a report with the hotel security and am anxious to hear back from them. </s>
<s> was such a disappointment ; as we liked the hotel and were having a great time in Chicago. </s>
<s> room was really nice ; with 2 bathrooms. </s>
<s> had 2 double beds and a comfortable hideaway bed. </s>
<s> had a great view of the lake and park. </s>
<s> hotel charged us $ 25 to check in early ' 10am. </s>
<s> was in business in Chicago ; so I decided to choose what I thought would be a relaxing hotel to treat myself a bit. </s>
<s> should have known when the woman at the front desk rolled her eyes when I asked for some of the complimentary apple cider advertised. </s>
<s> told me ; " It 's by the signs " in a " you-idiot " kind of voice. </s>
<s> bad the signs were too far away from me to read without my glasses ! I was ashamed and did not ask for anything from the front desk again. </s>
<s> room itself was horribly decorated and nothing special. </s>
<s> " I 'm too ugly to steal " furniture patterns and colors did not say " luxury " to me ! I went down to relax by the pool with my laptop ; to get some work done. </s>
<s> ; the pool was overrun with about five rowdy kids. </s>
<s> parents in sight. </s>
<s> would have reported them to the front desk ; but was shamed by the aforementioned apple cider incident. </s>
<s> God I left my laptop in its case ; or it would have been ruined by all of the water that was splashed on me ! The " free breakfast " tasted like cardboard ; it was something akin to a free breakfast at a $ 60-a-night hotel. </s>
<s> only tried it once because it made me feel sick when I ate it. </s>
<s> only good thing about my experience was leaving this overpriced motel behind to go to work ! The name Conrad ' the most luxurious of all Hilton hotels should illicit nothing but images of pure elegance and luxury ; however ; the Conrad in Chicago ; IL did obviously not receive the memo. </s>
<s> entering the hotel ; we were not greeted by any of the hotel staff. </s>
<s> ; we were not offered any help. </s>
<s> desk receptionist was beyond rude. </s>
<s> snide remarks towards my wife and me set the tone for a the rest of our stay. </s>
<s> getting our card ; we were finally offered help with our luggage. </s>
<s> young man who helped us could barely handle our luggage. </s>
<s> ; he somehow found more strength when it was time to collect his tip. </s>
<s> received the tip he deserved ; which he scoffed about and groaned under his breath as he walked away. </s>
<s> first looking at the room it was beautiful. </s>
<s> ; closer inspection revealed that the room had NOT been cleaned since the last visitor had left. </s>
<s> was hair in the sink and around the toilet. </s>
<s> was even a used bar of soap in the bathtub. </s>
<s> fact was not met with any apology by hotel staff. </s>
<s> ; I was told that was preposterous and that the room had indeed been cleaned to the highest of standards. </s>
<s> later ; someone came into the room to " investigate " . </s>
<s> they saw the mess that had been left ; they offered a menial apology. </s>
<s> another two hours later ; housekeeping arrived. </s>
<s> level of incompetence even extended to the valets in the parking garage. </s>
<s> the most incredible display of stupidity of our visit ; the valet actually brought the wrong car to me. </s>
<s> was half tempted to take the car that was brought to me ' it was certainly an incredible make and model ; but my better judgment prevailed. </s>
<s> informed the valet of his mistake ; to which he replied ; " Sorry dude ; I read your ticket wrong. </s>
<s> " 
I know that he did not smoke in my car ; but he smelled so strongly of smoke ; that the smell melted into my seat. </s>

<s> are so many better hotels in Chicago -- please spend your money elsewhere. </s>
<s> House A Hilton Hotel I had a business trip to Chicago last week and I decided to stay at the Palmer House after reading the online reviews. </s>
<s> I was the only one travelling and I was going to be at the office most of the time ; I decided to take a single bed guest room. </s>
<s> was a bad decision. </s>
<s> single bed guest rooms were small ; there was hardly any place to walk. </s>
<s> the bathrooms were smaller than the average hotel bathroom. </s>
<s> though I came to the hotel only to spend my evenings and nights ; my 3 day 4 night long stay at the hotel was disastrous. </s>
<s> beds were not comfortable and I was tired in the morning even after a good 8 hours of sleep. </s>
<s> the room service and dining is decent ; the quality of the rooms left a bad impression of the hotel in my mind. </s>
<s> place seems to be good only if you stay in the executive luxury suits which I hope is bigger than my room. </s>
<s> house was a huge disappointment and I will not be staying here if I ever visit Chicago again. </s>
<s> loved it here ! My boyfriend and I booked this hotel online and were a little worried what it would be like since we paid next to nothing for our 3 nights here. </s>
<s> I 've paid more to stay at the Santa Barbara Motel 6 ! Gorgeous hotel ; great staff ; fun bar 'lounge area and we were most impressed with the room. </s>
<s> large windows in the bathroom were the best -- I took a bubble bath one night while looking at the views of Navy Pier and the skyline. </s>
<s> remember thinking ; " This is really living . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> " 
The room was comfortable and quiet ; again with great views just like in the bathroom. </s>
<s> is a wonderful town -- I have nothing but good things to say about it. </s>
<s> n't wait to come back ! I have traveled to Chicago many times for business ; and so I have expectations of hotels based on reasonable comparisons. </s>
<s> was nothing dramatically wrong the Sheraton ; but it was simply overpriced for the quality of the hotel. </s>
<s> almost looked as if an accountant walk through the hotel looking for places to cut costs. </s>
<s> carpets were old ; there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom ; towels and linens were older than I expected ; the rooms were in need of some redecorating ; etc. </s>
<s> during the week I was paying $ 349 per night for a room ; and it simply was not near the quality I expected for that price. </s>
<s> positive to notice that the fitness room was quite good. </s>
<s> of aerobic machines with TVs ; weights ; etc. </s>
<s> location is also quite good ' perhaps the reason for the high price with close walks to Michigan Avenue and the river. </s>
<s> summary ; I think you can find a much nicer hotel in a much better price in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> only stayed here for five days ; but I will definitely never be going back. </s>
<s> architecture is kind of cool ; but the customer service was very poor. </s>
<s> do n't know how much these people get paid ; but they must not think it is enough. </s>
<s> at the The Continental was alright ; but it was overpriced. </s>
<s> hotel felt really crowded and the service was impersonal. </s>
<s> are many better places to stay in Chicago. </s>
<s> ; I traveled to Chicago for a business conference and was lucky enough to stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. </s>
<s> whole experience was wonderful ! The room was spacious and beautiful ; and the bed was so comfortable that I had no problem falling asleep ; as I normally do at other hotels. </s>
<s> staff were polite and courteous ; and after a delicious breakfast in the restaurant ; I went to my conference with a smile on my face. </s>
<s> Millennium Hotel Knickerbocker sounds fine ; and the website is pretty ; but the reality is an over-hyped ; overpriced ; reality-isn 't-as-good-as-fantasy package. </s>
<s> catering they offer is a joke ; you can pick up better food for half the price at a dozen or more places in the Chicago area. </s>
<s> the rooms were cleaner than most ; there was a lingering unpleasant odor from the cleaners they used that aggravated my sinuses ; and when I called to complain about it ; a nasal-voiced clerk blew me off. </s>
<s> rooms look small but cozy when you book online ; but when you get there in person ; you realize just how tiny they are. </s>
<s> to fit inside of one makes you think of being in a sardine can -- did I mention that it smelled like cleaning solution ? I also found a hair on my supposedly clean bed ; which made me wonder just how thorough their housekeeping staff is. </s>
<s> fact ; it looks like all of their rooms are comparatively small ; you 'd get better prices and a far better room from the Hilton. </s>
<s> stayed here through Hotwire and got an amazingly low rate- $ 60 some odd dollars nightly for a 2 night stay last May. </s>
<s> room they had us in was small and had no view of anything except the wall of the other part of the hotel ; but it was very clean ; tastefully decorated and cozy. </s>
<s> had a great vacation ; walking all over town until we ended up near the Planetarium which was where we then turned around and saw the skyline of Chicago and were just wow. </s>
<s> anyway ; the hotel is great ; the service was great ; the room was very nice- I would recommend this hotel to anyone though I work at the front desk of a hotel myself and the previous person 's comment about how she was n't able to get adjoining rooms ; well ; internet sites do n't guarantee things like that anyway- you 've got to call the hotel direct and verify things like that. </s>
<s> 's a note about that on internet sites as well- no room type 'location is guaranteed. </s>
<s> stars out of 5 for this hotel. </s>
<s> Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel has seen better days. </s>
<s> had fond memories of staying there when it was considered the finest hotel. </s>
<s> booked a room to celebrate a special occasion and found a highly-priced ; not so great property. </s>
<s> had to look at five suites before I found one where the upholstered furniture was to my liking ; some of the other rooms carpet was not clean ; the refrigerator was dripping water ; and the balcony was littered with cigarette butts. </s>
<s> finally settled for a room ; only because the bellman was friendly and apologetic but as over priced as it was I should have turned around and walked out. </s>
<s> sent a letter to the management when I returned home ; but it had been a month and I never received an answer. </s>
<s> are plenty of other places to spend your money. </s>
<s> n't leave it at this hotel. </s>
<s> went to stay in the Millenium Hotel Chicago. </s>
<s> ; first ; being from rural midwest I was surprised at the price in general ; but kind of accepted it when I was assured by my cousin 'whom I was visiting in Chicago said it was normal. </s>
<s> I check in ; service seems fine. </s>
<s> get checked in ; room seems ok. </s>
<s> couple of hours later ; a lady comes into my room ; not a hotel employee ; just some lady. </s>
<s> out ; they cross checked the rooms. </s>
<s> 'her and I went down and complained. </s>
<s> out they double booked the room ; not that they were full ; but they were full on THAT room type ; Standard ; as well as the Superior Rooms. </s>
<s> than simply upgrade one of us for the mistake they asked which one of us would like to " move up " . </s>
<s> argued with them for 20 minutes ; they did n't budge ; our only option was for one of us to fork over an extra $ 60 for a Corner Superior. </s>
<s> 'the lady ; her name was Sharon decided to split the difference some ; she gave me $ 20 and I moved. </s>
<s> get to the new room about 20 minutes later ; nobody ; but Sharon helped me move. </s>
<s> get there ; the bed was thrown together ; not made ; and the bathroom was n't clean ; the garbage had a kleenex in it 'I was n't going to check if it was used. </s>
<s> called down ; it was now 5PM. </s>
<s> answer ; I called for 10 minutes and finally got a hold of someone. </s>
<s> told them about the state of my room. </s>
<s> said they would have someone up " right away " . </s>
<s> waited 30 minutes and a lady comes in ; not in uniform ; but she did a hell of a job cleaning. </s>
<s> switched out the garbage ; wiped out the whole bathroom ; vaccuumed around me ; and switched out the bedding ; all told she was in and out in 10 minutes. </s>
<s> did n't say two words to me ; but she did clean. </s>

<s> from Iowa I live in Chicago and have frequent occasion to recommend hotels to friends and business acquaintances. </s>
<s> recently put up a candidate ' and his family we were recruiting for our company at the Conrad. </s>
<s> had had good luck with this hotel when it was a Le Meridien. </s>
<s> was a disappointment for all concerned as a Conrad. </s>
<s> the plus side ; our guests were able to check in early with no problem and they generally liked their room. </s>
<s> the downside . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
They learned after the fact that all rooms with two beds have no bath tub ' only a shower. </s>
<s> guests moved to a room with a bath tub and found hairs in it ; which they had to clean themselves. </s>
<s> the coffee bar had no caffeinated coffee and our guests asked for some ; they were told it would be delivered immediately. </s>
<s> they called 30 minutes later the front desk admitted that they had " forgotten. </s>
<s> " 
While the concierge and doorman were quite helpful ; our guests told us that the front desk personnel were sullen and unresponsive. </s>
<s> guests were generally under whelmed by one of the " five best hotels in Chicago. </s>
<s> " 
Conrad has a long way to go to compete with the Four Seasons ; Peninsula and Park Hyatt. </s>
<s> beautiful hotel with a wonderful view. </s>
<s> dinning selection is one of the best I have seen in Chicago. </s>
<s> have stayed many places downtown Chicago and nothing matches this. </s>
<s> am a single mother with two children and the concept of having a day care facility on site is just not great for me but for my children as well. </s>
<s> shopping area has great selections right outside of the doors. </s>
<s> biggest thing that I have to say is that the Customer service was great with everything that I needed. </s>
<s> give the hotel a 5 out of 5. </s>
<s> have stayed in the Talbott a few times and had always liked it. </s>
<s> time was my first visit in 2 years and I was disappointed. </s>
<s> hallways are now looking tired and the carpets need to be replaced. </s>
<s> had asked for a corner room but instead was given a small and very dark room looking out onto a wall 10 feet away with multiple noisy vents immediately outside the window. </s>
<s> lights had to be kept on throughout the day even through the days were bright. </s>
<s> bathroom was tiny and would be difficult to manage with 2 people in the room. </s>
<s> AC unit rumbled on permanently with background white noise even when switched off. </s>
<s> stayed there before I know there are better rooms but this one was the same price as the others I have been in and the risk is getting it again. </s>
<s> small things contributed - the lobby brownies are no longer ; there were no cup lids for the lobby coffee ' so you could n't walk out with the coffee and I got a newspaper only on the last morning of a 5-night stay. </s>
<s> construction noise was not too bad but does start at 7. </s>
<s> and goes on until around 8pm ; including weekends. </s>
<s> Chicago - I booked the Sheraton hotel after I read all the good reviews about it on tripadvisor and I would say the hotel is truly outstanding as it was described. </s>
<s> check-in was really easy and the staff were very welcoming and gave me a lake view room on the 10th floor. </s>
<s> was amazed at how spacious and delicately decorated the room was when I walked in. </s>
<s> was also such a nice surprise that the coffee machine actually provides Starbucks coffee. </s>
<s> bathroom was large and clean and the shampoo and conditioner provided were very really nice. </s>
<s> 's a little annoying that the WIFI needs extra charge per day ; but sometimes that 's just inevitable. </s>
<s> location of this hotel makes it very convenient to almost go anywhere you want. </s>
<s> is located at the heart of downtown Chicago and within walking distance to Navy Pier ; Magnificent Mile ; Millennium Park ; Art Institute ; the Loop District ; perfect for a new visitor to the city. </s>
<s> dining at Sheraton was also great. </s>
<s> especially enjoyed the steak and wine at the Shula 's ; I would say one of the finest in the country. </s>
<s> ; Sheraton is a great hotel for anyone visiting Chicago and I would definitely recommend it to all my friends. </s>
<s> at this hotel for labor day weekend and it was pretty awful. </s>
<s> staff were relatively friendly ; but that 's where the positive aspects stop. </s>
<s> was rock hard and VERY uncomfortable. </s>
<s> did n't work properly and the air conditioner was always 5 degrees warmer or colder than what you wanted. </s>
<s> though I think $ 10 for 1 day of internet is RIDICULOUS ; I bought it because I needed to download a powerpoint for work and send off a few emails. </s>
<s> was UNGODLY slow and barely better than dialup. </s>
<s> ended up finding a starbucks to use their wifi so I could actually get something done. </s>
<s> was overpriced ; as expected. </s>
<s> experience ; definitely would n't stay here again. </s>
<s> and beautiful ! i stayed two nights here and the room was immaculate. </s>
<s> of the staff were extremely nice and welcoming. </s>
<s> food was delicious and fixed to perfection. </s>
<s> entire hotel was clean ; warm and inviting. </s>
<s> definitely stay here again and recommend to any of my friends traveling to the area. </s>
<s> have recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and the visit was most unpleasant. </s>
<s> hotel was loud and the staff was very rude. </s>
<s> the fancy lights and designs are just a distraction from the snobby people who stay there and the people who work there that seem to hate their jobs. </s>
<s> hotel food was old ; it seemed like they were making it all at once for all the people staying there. </s>
<s> beds were hard and uncomfortable and it was an over all bad experience in what looked like a " nice place to spend a vacation " My wife and I 's stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers proved to be the perfect complement to our time spent visiting and exploring the Windy City. </s>
<s> our arrival ; we were immediately welcomed by the beautiful design of the first-floor lobby and the friendly demeanor of the desk and bell service staff. </s>
<s> seemingly no time at all we were in our clean and well-furnished room with a beautiful and peaceful view of Lake Michigan. </s>
<s> terms of accommodations ; I have never personally stayed at a hotel that I could complement more. </s>
<s> our very first night ; my wife took advantage of a message therapy session while I swam a few laps in the heated indoor swimming pool. </s>
<s> followed our time apart with a very relaxing time at the Chi bar ; which had a very enlivening and laid-back atmosphere. </s>
<s> to our rooms ; I could n't help but remark to my wife about the quality of our room and the bed in particular. </s>
<s> had a very comfortable night 's sleep and woke up just on time thanks to a spot-on wake up call from the desk staff. </s>
<s> a quick bite to eat the LB Bistro ; we headed out to sight-see. </s>
<s> ; I ca n't recommend the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers enough. </s>
<s> far as this customer is concerned ; it is the only place to stay if you are in the Chicago area and are looking for accommodations with the best customer service ; atmosphere ; and amenities. </s>
<s> could n't recommend it more. </s>
<s> Palmer House Hilton is located in the heart of the theatre ; financial and shopping districts of downtown Chicago. </s>

<s> rooms was clean and quite nice looking. </s>
<s> hotel 's restaurants are amazing. </s>
<s> hotel would definately exceed your expectations ; whether you are a business traveler or there on vacation. </s>
<s> stayed at The Talbott for 3 nights on business and was very pleased. </s>
<s> staff was friendly as can be immediately confirming the lore of the midwest. </s>
<s> was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious. </s>
<s> free wi-fi came in handy as I needed to work remotely while there. </s>
<s> from the comfort of the bed to the staff and location made this a great stay. </s>
<s> ; and I got to workout at the huge Equinox right next door for free. </s>
<s> Talbot hotel is an elegant place to take you wife or husband for a weekend getaway. </s>
<s> personally yours romantic package was fabulous. </s>
<s> check in we opened our room door and found a romantic atmosphere. </s>
<s> was rose pedals and luxurious bathrobes. </s>
<s> felt like it was our honey moon all over again. </s>
<s> hotel was an absolute dream to stay in. </s>
<s> could n't have picked a better hotel to spend in such luxury. </s>
<s> enjoyed the set up of the rooms and the space they offered. </s>
<s> room decor was extremely elegant and the location was great as well. </s>
<s> honestly felt like I was at a spa ! The price was very reasonable as well. </s>
<s> would definetly recommend this hotel to everyone I know. </s>
<s> you ever get a chance to spend a night here definetly choose the suite rooms ! It 's so frustrating when a hotel posts a deal prominently on its website ; claiming said deal is available on certain dates. </s>
<s> ; when you call to make a reservation based on that deal ; they tell you it 's not available. </s>
<s> are rooms available ; but not the deal. </s>
<s> they try to condescendingly tell you they can only sell so many rooms at such a deal. </s>
<s> get that. </s>
<s> just SAY that on the website. </s>
<s> Here 's a great deal . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but only a small number of people will actually get it. </s>
<s> " 
So much for the great reviews about service . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> could n't even get past the first phone call without being frustrated and annoyed. </s>
<s> form ; Conrad ; bad form. </s>
<s> Intercontinental Chicago Magnificent Mile The outside of the hotel itself is as the name says is pretty magnificent despite being set in what has to be the filthiest section in the city. </s>
<s> the cost of the rooms starting at 179. </s>
<s> a night ; you would think they would have a competent parking attendant. </s>
<s> was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room ; and if that was not enough. </s>
<s> top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork. </s>
<s> to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account. </s>
<s> would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations. </s>
<s> Hotel Chicago - Concierge was extremely pleasant and helpful. </s>
<s> room was spacious and the beds were super comfortable ' better than my bed at home ! One thing I was not happy with - one of the glass cups they provided was not cleaned very well. </s>
<s> usually never use the in-room glasses just for that reason ; so I called and had them bring some paper cups. </s>
<s> than that ; absolutely no complaints. </s>
<s> free Wi-Fi was much appreciated for keeping up with emails etc. </s>
<s> to mention the beautiful view ! WARNING : FOOD POISONING ALERT ! The room was dirty ; the shower had mold and the handle in the shower my daughter cracked her head open on. </s>
<s> elevators were absolutly terrible they made me dizzy every time i went on it. </s>
<s> hade pasta night and they put out a bowl of noodles and sauce and i couple of rolls well you get what you pay for. </s>
<s> was worse is the sauce must of had bad meat in it because my family got so sick. </s>
<s> one thing that was nice was the location which was right by michigan avenue. </s>
<s> second night we left and went to another hotel which was 80 bucks cheaper and 100 times nicer. </s>
<s> NOT STAY HERE It was my first time to visit Chicago and I would say ; i 'd definitely go back ; not just because of the Air and Water Show that we really enjoyed ; but most importantly ; because of the hotel that we stayed in. </s>
<s> Millennium Knickerbocker is not just accommodating to their human guests ; but with pets too. </s>
<s> first I was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog ; but I was surprised it turned out the other way. </s>
<s> 've experienced being denied reservations because of my dog and that 's really frustrating ; it 's just nice that there still are other hotels that are pet friendly. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends if they plan to visit Chicago. </s>
<s> Hotels --- The hotel was a nice place to stay. </s>
<s> was amazed by the beautiful interiors and the fact that they allowed pets. </s>
<s> time I wont have to leave my pet at home. </s>
<s> one bedroom apartment I stayed in ; was spacious and comfortable ; not to forget the relaxing bathroom ! Most importantly ; I did not miss my gym. </s>
<s> gym had almost everything I needed. </s>
<s> time I would love to explore more into your menu of services. </s>
<s> enjoyed shopping around the magnificent mile. </s>
<s> leaving Chicago ; I had a flight early morning ; which I had informed the staff earlier. </s>
<s> gave me a wake up call and even packed me breakfast for the journey ; which was quite fresh and tasty. </s>
<s> Audi cab facility ; I must say ; was quite a relief. </s>
<s> will recommend the Lake hotel to my company HR for any business visits to Chicago. </s>
<s> for the wonderful stay and food. </s>
<s> had a great experience staying at the Conrad Chicago ; the service was top notch ; the price was good ; but out of everything the service was outstanding. </s>
<s> would definitely stay there again when in the area and would suggest it to anyone looking for a good quality hotel in a great location. </s>
<s> next to the shops at North Bridge ! I stayed at the millennium Knickerbocker for 3 nights while on a business trip ; as it was conveniently located a few blocks away from the office I was visiting ; and just about everything else for that matter. </s>
<s> lobby was absolutely beautiful ; and the staff was beyond courteous and extremely helpful. </s>
<s> rooms were elegant and spacious ; and I instantly felt right at home. </s>
<s> large flat screen TV as a nice touch and TV options were many. </s>
<s> headed downstairs to the bar for a drink ; and was amazed at how well kept it was ; as well as how nice everybody was. </s>
<s> this was my first time I asked the bartender about the area around and he gave me great advice about some places to check out. </s>
<s> in all this was a great experience ; and next time I 'm in the area ; I will definitely be staying here. </s>
<s> 'd recommend the Millennium Knickerbocker to anyone traveling to Chicago. </s>
<s> chose to stay at the ' Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel during a recent trip to Chicago because I had heard they had good reviews. </s>
<s> ; were these reviews wrong ! I had terrible service from the moment I walked in the doors. </s>
<s> was not greeted by the receptionist ; it was like I was n't even there. </s>
<s> room was NOT ready for me when I got there ; even though I got there AFTER my required check-in time ; then once I was allowed to go to my room ; it was filthy ! It was as if they did n't even clean it ; so I do n't know what the hold up was. </s>
<s> were no towels ; shampoo or soap in the bathroom. </s>
<s> worst part was that there were bugs in the tub ! The place was the most disgusting place I 've ever been to ; and it is supposed to be one of the nicest ! It should be the nicest for the price they charge. </s>
<s> do not recommend staying here ! Stay at your own risk ! While it was a nice hotel ; but i am rather frustrated with them ! During our stay our room was cleaned twice by housekeeping. </s>
<s> first day was fine. </s>
<s> day my diamond earrings came up missing. </s>
<s> they were missing while in the packing up and checking out process. </s>
<s> biggest mistake was not staying there and dealing with this further. </s>
<s> we had a family reunion and funeral to get to. </s>
<s> the front desk was great and said they would handle it ; I believe they say these things just to get you to go on about your way ! We filed a police report and the GM of the hotel is supposed to be working on it. </s>
<s> have called several times but receive no answers. </s>
<s> keep telling us the cleaning staff have been there 10 years . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> that dose n't matter to me ! If they are not held accountable what 's to stop them from taking anything. </s>
<s> is a dishwasher in the room ; and they found my daughters ring ' which was in the same glass with my diamond earrings in the dishwasher. </s>
<s> say I put the cup in the dishwasher. </s>
<s> ; I am on vacation ; trust me i 'm NOT doing dishes ! Second ; why would I wash one glass and leave the other dirty dishes in the room ? So ; while it is a nice hotel . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> lock up your things of value ! They may come up " missing " and you 'll be left frustrated ! My family and I were in Chicago for a friend 's wedding. </s>
<s> had asked around to find a hotel that was nice ; but affordable and were pointed in the direction of the InterContinental Chicago hotel. </s>
<s> hotel appeared very nice ; and to have all the amenities : Room service ; WiFi ; clean rooms. </s>
<s> ; as it turned out ; appearances can be deceiving. </s>
<s> begins at the desk ; where the clerk was downright rude and uncaring. </s>
<s> said they did n't have any rooms available because we did n't make arrangements. </s>
<s> was getting late ; and we had no place to go ; there were n't any hotels nearby and my kids were starving. </s>
<s> asked if there was anything he could do ; and he said that I will have to ask someone else because he was busy. </s>
<s> talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing ; the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night. </s>
<s> ; our expectations for what would be the normal amenities for a hotel stay was above standard ; because this room was n't even clean and the wifi did n't work. </s>
<s> ordered room service ; and it never came ; even after several complaints. </s>
<s> does n't end there either ; when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us for the room service. </s>
<s> ; this was a very frustrating experience ; and I would n't stay there again. </s>
<s> - I was extremely unhappy with the attitude of this hotel 's staff toward customer satisfaction. </s>
<s> specifically asked for a big room on one of the lower floor because I have fear for heights ; but instead they put me on the top floor of their building. </s>
<s> I asked for an exchange they said they were full. </s>
<s> not come again. </s>
<s> Suites- I wish I had nicer things to say about this hotel- my most recent trip to Chicago was actually pretty enjoyable ; but only because I did n't have to spend too much time in my hotel room. </s>
<s> room was filthy ; I came in to see some strange pair of underwear on my bed ! It took room service all day to come by and take care of it. </s>
<s> there was the issue with the car- I needed to bring my car on this particular visit to the Windy City ; and the hotel charged me $ 42 a day to keep it in their lot ! Outrageous if you ask me. </s>
<s> will give credit where credit is due ; though ; and say that the pool was lovely. </s>
<s> the gym was disgusting and sweaty. </s>
<s> absolutely need to clean up their act if they ever want my business again. </s>
<s> staff and customer service ; very clean and spotless. </s>
<s> and luxurious with a beautiful ocean view. </s>

<s> give it a five star. </s>
<s> Talbott Hotel was very classy ; professional ; and luxurious. </s>

<s> was treated like i was royalty when i was there ; when in checked i was greeted by all of the people working behind the front desk and was offered a tour of the hotel. </s>
<s> took my bags and put them in my room while i was taking the tour and they even escorted me to my room right after we were done. </s>

<s> rooms are more than you can expect for a hotel. </s>
<s> services are abundant ; leaving no room to complain. </s>
<s> their fine diners ; you can not go wrong with enjoying a peaceful meal while relaxing. </s>
<s> this hotel ; it is truly an all-in-one hotel. </s>
<s> are meeting rooms and business centers ; leaving unfinished work not be a worry during the stay. </s>
<s> addition ; the spacious swimming pool is just the thing needed to relieve yourself of stress. </s>
<s> views from the rooms are breathtaking. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend staying there ! The hotel definitely does n't match its 4. </s>
<s> rating. </s>
<s> receptionist was very unhelpful and dishonest ; and I do n't feel welcome at all. </s>
<s> booked a non-smoking room ; but upon arrival ; the receptionist told me that there was no non-smoking room left. </s>
<s> course he was lying. </s>
<s> argued with him for 5 minutes ; before he reluctantly gave me a non-smoking room. </s>
<s> checkout ; they tried to charge me $ 40 upgrade fee each day ; because I requested a non-smoking room. </s>
<s> was completely ridiculous. </s>
<s> had to go argue with the receptionist again before they agreed to take away the charges. </s>
<s> room was quite small ; the TV was broken ; so I had to call someone to fix the TV. </s>
<s> the wireless network banned my IP address ; so I had to talk to their tech-support -- the tech support was quite friendly ; knowledgeable and helpful -- I guess this was the only bright point of the stay. </s>
<s> stayed here in the last weekend of September 2010 for the Bears vs Packers Monday Night game. </s>
<s> room rocked ! I had a pretty big flat screen ; and a super soft bed. </s>
<s> room was clean and stylish ; and the staff was very courteous from check-in to check-out. </s>
<s> favorite part was the amazing bathroom - way better than mine at home. </s>
<s> definitely had a great escape that weekend and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to relax. </s>
<s> Conrad Chicago hotel had some of the worst service I have ever dealt with. </s>
<s> got the Executive Room with a king size bed. </s>
<s> I got in ; the sheets were stained with some type of chocolate or mud. </s>
