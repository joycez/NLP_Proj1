<s> time I visit Chicago ; I will be staying at another hotel. </s>
<s> Chicago - I would say Hilton Chicago is one of the best hotel I 've ever stayed. </s>
<s> I first entered the hotel ; I was amazed by the luxurious decoration of the lobby and the welcoming staff to help me check in. </s>
<s> receptionist was so thoughtful to put me in a room on the 10th floor so that I could enjoy the splendid view of Michigan Lake. </s>
<s> I walked into the room ; I was really impressed by the size and layout of the room. </s>
<s> spent the evening watching sports while enjoying the sunset over the lake. </s>
<s> can you beat that ! The location of the hotel was also perfect since it has lots of nice restaurants and bars within walking distance and it 's so nice to take a walk around the area after the dinner. </s>
<s> all ; I loved Hilton Chicago and would recommend anyone who plan to spend a great night at Chicago ! I had a large ; roomy ; clean 2 bed room with a large bathroom ; big minibar snack assortment and was tucked away nicely in the corner so that there was no hall noise. </s>
<s> Service here was absolutely incredible ; from the doorman to the front desk ; to the gentleman who delivered my toothpaste to my room when I requested it. </s>
<s> ; you get a little outside noise ; but it is a big city ; that is not unusual ! I really enjoyed my stay here and strongly recommend it. </s>
<s> recently had the displeasure of staying at the Conrad Chicago. </s>
<s> the hotel came with some recommendations from various online websites ; my experience was anything but pleasent. </s>
<s> of all ; they tell you that check in time is at 3pm. </s>
<s> I arrived at the hotel at 3 : 30pm and checked in only to discover that my room was not ready. </s>
<s> waiting for nearly an hour for the room to be ready ; I decided to go settle in. </s>
<s> carpets in the room smelled old and musty. </s>
<s> ; the bathroom was not in the the cleanest of states and there were numerous noticeable chips ; scratches ; and dents in the furniture. </s>
<s> the bed was comfortable ; I just could n't get over the musty smell coming from the carpet. </s>
<s> was very difficult to get the air conditioning to set a comfortable temperature and I did not have a very good nights sleep. </s>
<s> in all ; my experience was not the worst I 've ever had ; but far from anything worth writing home about. </s>
<s> is located 1 '2 mile from the train station which is quite hike when you 're traveling with luggage and 'or kids. </s>
<s> seem to cash in on guests who arrive in private car by charging exorbitant parking 'valet fees. </s>
<s> feature either double or king sized beds ; no queen beds at all. </s>
<s> you want a little extra leg room in your bed ; the price jump from double- to king-sized is stiff. </s>
<s> with any kind of view pay a healthy surcharge ; too. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel. </s>
<s> was always courteous and helpful - from the front desk staff at check-in to wait staff in Aria restaurant ; to the maid who cleaned my room. </s>
<s> rooms were recently updated ; with large flat-screen TV 's ; beautiful linens ; and exceptional toiletries in each room. </s>
<s> room even had a view of Monroe St. </s>
<s> harbor. </s>
<s> is truly a first-rate hotel. </s>
<s> is south of the river and east of Michigan Ave -- as we normally stay north of the river it seems a little out of the way ' if that 's possible in downtown Chicago ; however its location significantly lowers street noise. </s>
<s> hotel has excellent access to Millennium Park ; the Aon center ' there is a connecting concourse ; and is about 4 blocks from shopping on North Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> ate dinner in Aria and it was fantastic ! Room service for breakfast was quite good as well. </s>
<s> ; I 'd stay again in a minute if I had business in the loop ; or leisure plans in Millennium or Grant Parks. </s>
<s> ; awesome service. </s>
<s> ; the people are amazing. </s>
<s> ; and the nice bartender who serves after last call ' at least ; that 's what I was told - I of course do n't drink save this place from one star. </s>
<s> seriously blah ; small ; non-luxury rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable - and for a card rate of $ 725 'night ; even in a major city ; the rooms better be awesome. </s>
<s> 've had waaaay better rooms in NYC for $ 350 'night. </s>
<s> Good thing I had a corporate rate. </s>
<s> '
And my room was not especially big ; despite what the below reviews say. </s>
<s> here 's the main problem. </s>
<s> on the 10th floor ; the guy blowing the whistle to summon cabs downstairs woke me up at 6 ; and 6 : 15 ; and 6 : 30 ; and 6 : 45 ; and 6 : 50 ; and 6 : 55 ; and . </s>

<s> now safely ensconced in the Four Seasons. </s>
<s> was really expecting a lot more from a quality chain like the Sheraton ; but a recent stay at their downtown location in Chicago was somewhat of a disappointment. </s>
<s> started with check in ; I had specifically requested a room with a single king-size bed ; but was told at the front desk in no uncertain terms ' OK ; rather rudely ! that because of some banker 's convention that was going on ; I should be happy with the double-bed room that was left. </s>
<s> was all I could do to get a lousy drink voucher for my inconvenience ! The room itself was OK ; nothing special though. </s>
<s> cleaning staff must 've just been through ; because there was a faint aroma of old washrags still in the air. </s>
<s> internet jack was n't working. </s>
<s> took more than two hours for a maintenance guy to come up to fix it ; no apologies given. </s>
<s> the price ; I really expected more in the way of customer service from Sheraton. </s>
<s> guess they 're really no better than anyone else these days ! I love the free breakfast and dinners on weeknights. </s>
<s> hotel is clean and nice rooms The pool needs some updating 'but kids do n't care My friend and I took our granddaughters for a grandma grandaughter outing and this hotel was perfect Sheraton Chicago - Do not let all the decor in lobby fool you ; the rooms at the Sheraton do not match up. </s>
<s> stayed here for two nights ; and I had to ask for two room changes : the first room had a faulty shower ; and the second seemed to be in the process of cleaning when I entered. </s>
<s> also was not a big fan of the unnecessary extra furniture in the room : the uncomfortable chair was arranged so that one can barely see the television while being blasted in the face by the air conditioning. </s>
<s> top of that ; the $ 199 a night rate does not include free internet ; something that I feel should be commonplace nowadays. </s>
<s> restaurants downstairs were alright ; but one can definitely get better for the same or even lower price outside ; especially in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> the Sheraton may have a pretty good reputation across the country ; the Sheraton Chicago does not meet those expectations ; and I would recommend staying elsewhere. </s>
<s> HOTEL IS FANTASTIC. </s>
<s> stayed there on my way through Chicago towards Arizona ; and could not believe the great quality of the hotel. </s>
<s> 'd have thought I was in a Vegas suite. </s>
<s> polite staff ; great housekeeping ; and amazing prices. </s>
<s> my way out ; I was telling the manager about how much I 'd loved the hotel ; and he even offered me an extra night there ! You can safely say that my trip was delayed roughly 24 hours. </s>
<s> stayed in this hotel for a week and I was looking forward to a stay at a top class hotel. </s>
<s> was shocked and disapointed with my stay ; Here are some of my gripes - Room had a broken phone and broken lightbulb - Breakfast service was slow and impolite - Hotel rationed shampoo ' one bottle for two people sharing and did not refill a bottle that was less than half full. </s>
<s> We also shared a bar of soap. </s>
<s> was so disappointed with this hotel ; I paid for a premium hotel and got a very disappointing stay. </s>
<s> you love Brick Walls and Alleyways ; then this view is for you. </s>
<s> asked for a room facing the river ; I get a room facing a Brick Wall. </s>
<s> really pissed me off. </s>
<s> all the great reviews ; I was expecting better. </s>
<s> I came here ; I stayed in a Hyatt in NYC ; and that was awesome. </s>
<s> was nothing about the hotel that blew me away. </s>
<s> wine hour was ok. </s>
<s> was hoping there would be something better food ; but I guess that 's why it 's a wine hour. </s>
<s> ordered room service one night. </s>
<s> was n't really anywhere to eat it ; so I had to eat it on my bed to watch tv. </s>
<s> was my first time coming to Chicago ; and I think it will be my last. </s>
<s> thoroughly disappointed. </s>
<s> - Stayed at the Talbott during my last trip to Chicago ; thought I 'd try it after not loving the Whitehall down the street. </s>
<s> ; I did n't like the Talbott much better. </s>
<s> rooms seemed a little dark for my taste ; and the bathrooms were a tad small. </s>
<s> the hotel is close to some of the main areas of Chicago ; this resulted in a lot of traffic noise for the room ' nothing like late-night honking during an in-room movie. </s>
<s> hotel amenities were of reasonable quality but frankly just not worth the price. </s>
<s> ; I recently stayed at the Affinia hotel in Chicago ; and was very unhappy when I learned of additional charges upon arrival. </s>
<s> I made the reservations over the phone there was no mention of any internet or parking fees. </s>
<s> I arrive I 'm told fee to valet park is $ 49 per day ; plus another $ 10 for internet. </s>
<s> is just plain ridiculous ; and will remember not to stay here in future. </s>
<s> 's too many other fine hotels that do n't charge these fees. </s>
<s> Hotel Chicago - I stayed in the Omni hotel when I had been to Chicago on a business trip. </s>
<s> had checked in online and was pleased to know that the keys were waiting for me at the front desk. </s>
<s> room was spacious with nice comfortable bed ; with a large bathroom and a hot shower. </s>
<s> view from the room was not that great and even though I could hear a little noise from outside ; it did not disturb my sleep. </s>
<s> service staff were friendly and extremely helpful. </s>
<s> Wi-Fi bandwidth was good and helped me access my work computer without any hassles and disconnections. </s>
<s> hotel was close to where I worked and also to Magnificent Mile and several other shopping attractions and theatres. </s>
<s> hotel was not worth it. </s>
<s> the moment we walked into the hotel lobby through check out ; the staff were rude and contemptuous. </s>
<s> were only serviceable ; and certainly did not live up to the pompous self-descriptions on the website. </s>
<s> bathroom porthole and sliding door were odd and inconvenient. </s>
<s> ' fitness centre was tiny and poor. </s>

<s> distance to much of what Chicago has to offer. </s>
<s> 's steakhouse and the Hancock building to name a couple. </s>
<s> hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for Chicago. </s>
<s> should also have more than three stars. </s>
<s> mean three stars is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard ; and this place far exceeds chain hotels like those. </s>
<s> on the room you get ; any price under $ 250 would be a good deal. </s>
<s> 250 - 300 could still be worth it. </s>
<s> in a Junior Suite which was beautiful and spacious. </s>
<s> had the largest flat screen tv I have ever seen in a hotel ' great excuse to catch up on some movies The breakfast buffet was great and was served in the hotels huge atrium which was nice. </s>

<s> in a lower floor in the East tower which was great as there was no waits for an elevator and they were always empty. </s>
<s> Shed aquarium was a complete waste of time and money but the Field musium was amazing. </s>
<s> remains tied with London as my favourite city. </s>
<s> stayed at the Swissotel for a business trip the first week of Aug 2007. </s>
<s> arrived late the first night and got shoved into a hospitality room the first night. </s>
<s> ; this was more than made up when after a strong talk they assigned me a corner room on the 28th floor. </s>
<s> view of the city ; river and Lake Michigan. </s>
<s> fact ; I would say the corner room of the Swissotel has a better view than any other hotel in the vicinity. </s>
<s> room was huge ; and everything was clean and the bathroom was nice. </s>
<s> hotel is very convieniently located to the Magnificient Mile and Millenium Park. </s>

<s> top it all off ; they have the most incredible shower that I 've ever used ' and ; even better ; it 's all " green " . </s>

<s> would recommend the Amalfi Hotel to anybody with good taste that visits Chicago. </s>
<s> Swissotel Chicago hotel aspires to be a tourist 's paradise ; a hotel so grand and luxurious that you 'd rather stay than return home at the end of your trip. </s>
<s> is it really as magnificent as suggested ? True ; you can get a massage ; the rooms have flat screen T. </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> my recent weekend stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel ; i was very disappointed. </s>
<s> chose this hotel after scouring various hotel websites in the area. </s>

<s> noticed spiderwebs in corners ; and a lack of cleanliness in the bathroom. </s>
<s> ; it was advertised that there was an i pod docking station in the room ; however ; it did not work and I had to call down for them to bring a replacement. </s>
<s> ; as a guest should not have had to call down ; these items should be checked to ensure they work properly before a guest checks in. </s>
<s> found the restaurants on site to be crowded ; loud and not to mention an unusally long wait to be served my meal. </s>

I have stayed at Intercontinental Chicago more than once but after my recent visit last month ; I think it has lost its 4 and a half star quality. </s>

<s> was definitely our favourite. </s>
<s> we come back in July to see the play " Wicked " for the second time ; we will be again at Swissotel. </s>

<s> looked nice when I got there ; but for the price I paid ; I was really expecting something far above and beyond what I got. </s>
<s> I was n't dressed right ; or did n't carry the right luggage ; but the front desk clerk was unnecessarily snooty when I checked in. </s>
<s> n't a hotel try to make its guests feel welcome ? When I stayed at the cheap hotels in college ; the front desk employees were always friendly when I checked in and out ; and they would give me good tips on the best way to get to the fun things in the city. </s>
<s> ; I did n't even want to ask for any tips at the front desk because I did n't want to deal with the eye rolling and " too important to be bothered " attitude I got when I checked in. </s>
<s> guess the location was more convenient than the hotels I used to visit ; but I really thought that part of the money I was spending on a nice hotel would pay for a pleasant customer service experience. </s>
<s> ; obviously I can afford to stay at your hotel ; I already booked and paid for the room. </s>
<s> if customer service is n't your number one goal ; making money should be pretty high up on the list ; and making a paying customer feel unwelcome is n't a very good way to secure return business. </s>

Needless to say we are VERY disappointed. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown ; and found it lacking in the quality of their service. </s>

<s> of the complimentary services include fast-speed wireless internet access ; cardio-fitness and indoor pool ; grocery shopping service and coffee ; tea ; hot chocolate or cider all day long in the lobby 's 24 hour convenience shop. </s>
<s> the wireless internet was spotty at best with really slow speed at times ; the indoor pool was far to cold in my opinion and the cardio equipment was left uncleaned. </s>
<s> grocery shopping service was alright ; although a bit on the slow side and then finally the coffee and hot chocolate in the 24 hour convenience shop were both cold and overall of poor quality. </s>
<s> this Hotel on a scale of 1 to 5 ; I would give it a 3 at best. </s>
<s> the hotel looked absolutely lovely from the outside ; my experience went downhill once I walked in. </s>
<s> lighting is very poor ; which creates such a dark and gloomy atmosphere. </s>
<s> mood was accompanied by less-than-friendly staff members who made our check-in seem like nothing more than a huge hassle. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet night or a nice stay. </s>
<s> definitely would not stay here again. </s>
<s> ! I have been to many hotels as a business man ; and have seen my fair share of garbage dump hotels. </s>
<s> wow ; this hotel was great. </s>
<s> staff was prompt ; the room was extremely clean ; and everything just ran like a well-oiled machine. </s>
<s> was particularly impressed with the fact that the front desk gives out free toiletries and other things. </s>
<s> I have to pay 5$ for a stupid toothbrush ; but not here ! I really enjoyed staying at InterContintental. </s>
<s> was very worried about the Chicago area 's reputation of bad hotels ; but this turned out just great. </s>
<s> time my boss flies me out to Chicago ; I know where I am staying ! Our suite at the Knickerbocker are quite nice ; but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal. </s>
<s> ; a member of the staff entered our room mid-day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present. </s>
<s> a tremendous problem ; but when the young woman at the front desk replied " What do you want me to do about it " with the tone of a flippant teenager ; I began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff. </s>
<s> forward to this evening. </s>
<s> a lovely meal off the premises ; we chose to turn in a bit early at 11 : 30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions ; the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room. </s>
<s> prudently and with restraint ; we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs ; but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response. </s>
<s> at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel ; and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume. </s>
<s> one hand I appreciated his honesty ; but on the other ; I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property. </s>
<s> we 're out of options for the evening ; we 've decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being ; but given the circumstances ; the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession. </s>
<s> ; I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night ; a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property. </s>
<s> would n't have been a concern if like nearby hotels ; the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby. </s>
<s> I stay here again ? Maybe on a dare ; or if someone else was footing the bill. </s>
<s> I 've had better experiences in road side motels ; and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests ; and more importantly simple common sense. </s>
<s> - Incredibly overpriced. </s>
<s> rooms were nice and the architecture of the building itself was really pretty ; and it 's really close to downtown ; but not worth shelling out the extra bucks. </s>
<s> n't even include breakfast -- you had to pay for an upgrade to get " complimentary " breakfast ' it did look good though ; lots of fresh fruit. </s>

<s> ; at checkout our room bill was conveniently not available so they mailed it to us ; which we were charged for the 3rd night when our room was actually prepaid. </s>
<s> was courteously taken care of after contacting hotel. </s>
<s> was very small and uninviting and there was very poor selection for appetizers 'food. </s>
<s> more The Amalfi Hotel advertises itself as a " luxury boutique hotel " and as such I expected my experience there to be somewhat better than average. </s>
<s> ; this was not the case. </s>
<s> room I booked was not clean ; in particular the bathroom looked as if someone had done a very minimal amount of cleaning after the last guest. </s>
<s> was hair in the corners of the room leading me to think the floor had not been swept or cleaned. </s>
<s> addition ; although the room was supposed to be a non-smoking room ; I could still detect the odor of cigarette smoke. </s>
<s> will say that the staff was courteous and the hotel is very well situated in terms of the many restaurants ; sites and shops all within walking distance. </s>
<s> ; given the cost of the room and my experience with the cleanliness of the room ; I would not stay at the Amalfi Hotel again. </s>

<s> waiting an hour to check in we were not able to get the room features that we had requested. </s>
<s> were informed that they were " only requests " and not a guarantee. </s>
<s> service was also very slow and appeared to be understaffed. </s>

<s> I first arrived I was impressed with the architecture and location ; but things went downhill in a hurry. </s>
<s> front desk staff was extremely rude upon checking in and even though I had reserved a room with two queen beds ; they told me that " only king bed rooms were available at the time " ; and there was nothing they could do about it. </s>
<s> room itself was a nightmare. </s>
<s> smelled like an ashtray and it was very clear that the bedding was in dire need of replacement. </s>
<s> was also a huge problem with my television ; in that it would automatically turn itself off every 15 minutes or so. </s>
<s> complained about these problems ; but very little was done. </s>
<s> hotel staff eventually did bring me new sheets ; but the quality was only marginally improved. </s>
<s> I was very disappointed with my stay at the InterContinental Hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> the pictures I had seen online I had expected a wonderful hotel ; but what I actually got was on par with what you would typically find at a rundown interstate motel. </s>
<s> room looked like a country club prison cell. </s>
<s> paint on all walls ; doors ; trims ; not especially clean. </s>
<s> platform bed and a long shelf 'desk with an iron chair. </s>

<s> n't waste your money. </s>
<s> NOT STAY HERE ! My wife and I were visiting family in Chicago and decided to stay at the James. </s>

<s> was also a musty odor to the room. </s>
<s> we called the front desk to complain they were quite rude. </s>
<s> ended up leaving and staying in a different hotel for the duration of our stay. </s>
<s> first inspection ; Sofitel Chicago Water Tower looks like an excellent place to spend a few days in the heart of downtown Chicago ; but appearances can certainly be deceiving. </s>
<s> summed up ; Sofitel is nothing more than a fancy Holiday Inn. </s>
<s> certainly shows that this hotel is part of a chain ; even if it is an international one. </s>
<s> customer service is poor unless you look like you have $ 50 to tip someone. </s>
<s> furniture throughout the establishment looks and feels like it cane from Ikea. </s>
<s> rooms are dirty when you first walk in ; the air feels stale ; and the views are certainly all they 're cracked up to be. </s>
<s> of this is worth a " luxury " price or even worthy of a " luxury " name. </s>
<s> will certainly not be staying here again. </s>
<s> reserved the " Rock star " suite for my boyfriend 's birthday months and months in advanced. </s>
<s> we arrived at the Hotel Monaco ; they told us that they doubled booked the room. </s>
<s> was after many emails to the hotel inquiring about the room and if it was available. </s>
<s> tried to make up for it by providing us with a room with a wonderful view of the river and giving us a ten dollar gift certificate to their resturant - which we did n't even use. </s>
<s> felt we were taken advantage of because we were young. </s>
<s> doorman did n't make us feel any better when he told us that it was n't the first time they did this for the " rock star " suite. </s>
<s> ; the conceirge was incredible with providing us with a bottle of champagne for his birthday and delivered the birthday cake I ordered. </s>
<s> it was n't for the room confusion - It would have been a wonderful stay. </s>
<s> James Hotel in Chicago was a huge let down. </s>
<s> was expecting a truly spectacular experience. </s>
<s> the website it appears to be an absolutely fabulous state of the art hotel. </s>
<s> ; my family 's bad experience started right when we walked in the door. </s>
<s> turns out the room we had reserved had been given to someone else ; and the man at the front desk was extremely rude. </s>
<s> had to wait for an hour for the house keeping service to prepare a new room for us. </s>
<s> room had an odd smell and we had to ask for towels and hand soap as they were n't already in the room. </s>
<s> one thing that was good about the place was the fabulous gym. </s>
<s> in all ; I feel that we paid way too much for what we got. </s>
<s> time I will look to stay somewhere else. </s>

<s> recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco for five nights ; checking out on Monday ; March 19th. </s>
<s> after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet ; my partner and I noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that was n't present upon checking in. </s>
<s> had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay. </s>
<s> called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at Park One ' their valet company who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival ; and was scraped upon departure from the garage. </s>
<s> garage manager ; Mike Yunan ; did n't call back until I had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel ; Marco Scherer. </s>
<s> he finally got back to me ; the garage manager stated that he would file an " incident report " and claim with his insurance company ; Travelers ; which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff would n't admit fault or liability ; nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage ; which could have verified that the damage was n't present upon check-in ; but was at check-out. </s>
<s> insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location ; contradicting the garage manager. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> they seemed to have my reservation and checked me in fairly easily. </s>
<s> location was fine being that it was central to the city but I found out that it was also a tremendous drawback. </s>
<s> was interesting that the survey I took at the hotel in order to obtain internet access at the hotel asked what my most important quality was in a hotel visit and my response " Quiet " . </s>
<s> visit was anything but ; mainly attributed to the fact that they put me on the second floor ; facing the street. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> and never did return to sleep because of the constant street noise and screeching of the L train that sounded as though it was just outside my window. </s>

<s> forgot my hair dryer but thankfully ; one of the many perks at this hotel ; they provide one for you in your room ! That 's a small benefit compared to the lucious pool and dreamy massages they offer ! I have never had a massage like that before ! My favortie thing about the Omni is the high speed wireless internet that is available to all guests. </s>

<s> staff was very slow ; I am assuming they were all new. </s>
<s> could not say where anything was or what attractions were nearby. </s>
<s> room was set up weird ; the bathroom opened facing the bed ; rather than the hall as most do. </s>

<s> 45 minutes later ; a manager returned my call and stated a double room was available. </s>

<s> 's unfortunate is they continued to place guests into this room. </s>
<s> did not offer any reufunds or perks for my sleepless night in the sauna ! This hotel need a major overhaul ! This is a superb hotel. </s>
<s> rooms are huge ; including a luxurious bathroom. </s>
<s> is clean and service is first rate. </s>
<s> was excellent ' and complimentary for Hilton Honors members. </s>

<s> Chicago ; Millennium Park - My husband and I just returned from Chicago and had a nice trip ; but this was not because of the Fairmont Hotel we stayed at. </s>

<s> checked in quite early ' no problem and was efficiently checked in. </s>

<s> do n't generally require much during my hotel stays ; but suffice to say the doorman ; housekeeping ; the night manager and bartender at 676 ; the day waiter at 676 ; and the concierge were amazing - I never waited more than about 30 seconds for anything. </s>

<s> a regular visitor to Chicago and a freuent guest at the Ambassador East ; I was exceptionally disappointed during our last visit. </s>
<s> service has been eliminated despite the renowned Pump Room being located in the hotel ; there was no in-room directory ; the carpet was torn and stained ; no phone book ; the refigerator and honor bar had been removed ; and the room was so small I had to turn sideays to get past the bed and the armoire. </s>
<s> asked the desk clerk about larger rooms ; and he said they were all the same except for corner rooms - which is untrue ; as there are several larger room types. </s>
<s> did n't even offer to check availablity of other rooms ! In talking with the consierge ; she blamed everything on upcoming renovations - which the hotel has been promising for more than two years. </s>

<s> bad news : Michelle ; the Director of Catering ; honestly made my wedding planning process a nightmare. </s>
<s> we were negotiating the contract ; she promptly responded to my emails and phone calls ; after the contract was signed ; it was a constant struggle to get in touch with her to get my questions answered ; to schedule the tasting ; etc. </s>
<s> frequently took over a week to respond to a simple email ; and she occasionally never returned my email or phone call until I called her a second or third time. </s>
<s> assumed things would get better within the month -- or even the week -- prior to my wedding ; but they actually got even worse. </s>

<s> recently traveled up to Chicago for business and had a terrific 3 day 2 night stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in downtown. </s>
<s> location was perfect as it gave me easy access to Michigan Avenue and the conference center where I was doing business. </s>
<s> hotel room was rather nice with a very comfortable king size bed and a cozy atmosphere. </s>
<s> ordered room service for dinner and it came within 30 minutes so I was quite pleased with that and they serve from their own restaurant which is located downstairs. </s>
<s> food was extremely good and I really enjoyed not having to go out and fight the traffic to find a good place to eat. </s>
<s> had been really tired from my meeting earlier in the day and had no trouble going to bed on the comfortable mattress. </s>
<s> woke up and took a shower and the bathroom was definitely up to standard with any other quality hotel. </s>

<s> was on the 29th floor ; absolutely clean and nice and a breathtaking lakeview. </s>
<s> perfect and service really good. </s>
<s> were always helpful. </s>
<s> 's a little bit far from Magnificent mile and the loop ; but in front of the hotel there are buses ' number6 'waiting there next turn ; not a real bus stop ; but drivers are frindly and you can get on the bus. </s>
<s> time going to Chicago we will again stay in the Swissotel. </s>
<s> Affinia Chicago is a wonderful place to stay ; my husband and I stayed there for a week to visit some family and had an amazing time. </s>
<s> rooms were very well organized and comfortable ; the staff there are very friendly ; and the food there is more then amazing. </s>
<s> are defiantly going back next year. </s>
<s> enjoyed the Hotel Monaco. </s>
<s> location for walking and beautiful rooms. </s>
<s> staff was so friendly and we especially enjoyed the wine reception and getting to meet other guests. </s>
<s> definitely stay there again ! We reserved a room with a sleeper couch a few weeks before our stay. </s>
<s> checking in and unpacking ; we discovered that the sleeper sofa had been removed ' supposedly during renovation. </s>
<s> front desk clerk and bellman never mentioned that there was no sleeper sofa even though they saw all 4 of us check into the room. </s>
<s> ; one of the managers ; was argumentative and did nothing to resolve the problem. </s>
<s> ended up having one of our children sleep on the couch and the other slept on an antiquated rollaway bed. </s>
<s> never spoke to the general manager who was conveniently " absent from the hotel " during most of our stay. </s>
<s> stayed here on more than one occasion over the past decade and had never encountered such incompetence. </s>
<s> had to make several phone calls to receive a miserly discount and we never received an apology. </s>
<s> lack of training of the staff was clearly evident ; as was the cavalier attitude of the management. </s>
<s> - Last week ; I went on a trip to Chicago and stayed at the hotel for two nights. </s>
<s> chose here mainly because its location in downtown with easy access to public transports ' bus ; subway ; airport making it an ideal base for exploring Chicago. </s>
<s> room is not huge but has sufficient space and has nice and cozy decorations. </s>
<s> bathroom is a lot larger than any of us would have imagined and is equipped with branded soap and shampoo. </s>
<s> staffs are efficient and professional yet friendly. </s>
<s> front desk greeted us with smile ; the conceirge is very knowledgable of the area and gave us some insightful advice to improve our plan. </s>
<s> is very helpful if it is your first time here. </s>
<s> did not have a chance to try the restaurant though which is a pity because we really like one of the restaurant 's interiors with cozy big red sofa and high ceiling in addition to the food. </s>
<s> we will try that the next time. </s>
<s> in all ; we had a pleasant stay at this hotel and will come back next time. </s>
<s> had a great time here ! It is centerally located in Chicago so walking around is so easy and pleasent. </s>
<s> staff was amazing and very helpful ! Parking was a bit steep ; but to be expected. </s>
<s> room was very nice and the bed and linens were very confortable. </s>
<s> yoga mat rental was wonderful as well ! Wonderful and relaxing experience overall. </s>
<s> one of my better experiences ; When I first arrived at the hotel and tried to get my room key it was discovered that they were fresh out of keys. </s>
<s> had to wait half an hour while someone ran out to get more keys. </s>
<s> would n't have been as bad but the lobby looked to be in slight disrepair. </s>
<s> I finally got to the room I found the burnt out light bulb and an unmade bed. </s>
<s> room was an ok size for one person but any more than that and it would probably get a bit crowded. </s>
<s> the view from the window was amazing ; and it took away some of the bad for me. </s>
<s> ; it just felt like the owners of the hotel stopped caring ; maintenance took four or so hours to finally come fix the light. </s>
<s> did n't even get housekeeping my entire stay there. </s>
<s> would n't recommend this hotel to anyone in the area ; hopefully it will make them get their act together. </s>
<s> have stayed at several high end places in Chicago and this is still our favorite. </s>
<s> is superb ; staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying. </s>
<s> ; at the front desk ; is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge. </s>
<s> love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program ; high speed internet is gratis ; as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing. </s>
<s> is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains ! We have never had a bad stay at this hotel. </s>
<s> decided to stay at The James last weekend with our kids. </s>
<s> reserved the " Family Adventurer with Paul Frank " . </s>
<s> 's a special offer by the hotel to entice visitors to see the local museums and aquarium. </s>
<s> ended up receiving 2 Chicago City Passes ; which ultimately paid for themselves and 4 tickets for the Chicago Children 's Museum. </s>
<s> kids had a ball. </s>
<s> ended the day with a milk and cookies turn down service and a special pair of pajamas that my daughter adored. </s>
<s> in all ; a great weekend where my kids were the focus. </s>
<s> adults certainly were n't forgotten since we had a great breakfast in the room the next morning. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> I visit this fun city quite often ; I was somewhat disappointed with the service and noise in a hotel that is called " luxury boutique " . </s>
<s> begin with ; our " Experience Designer " was somewhat put-offish and cool. </s>
<s> did not really have a grasp of all the wonderful things to do in Chicago. </s>
<s> she did look up some attractions ; it seems like she may have recently arrived from LA. </s>
<s> far as the room ; it was indeed luxury and had nice lighting and decoration. </s>
<s> ; the noise from the adjoining room was unbelievable and kept us up all night. </s>
<s> likely ; the walls are very thin ; and construction is not the greatest. </s>
<s> wants to hear the neighbors ; especially when they are honeymooners or whatever ! So we probably will not stay there again. </s>
<s> location is great ; the cocktails fine ; the luxury is there ; but other than that ; it is the pits. </s>
<s> Traveler ; San Francisco I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. </s>
<s> husband and I had planned a trip to Chicago for our tenth wedding anniversary. </s>
<s> had gone to great expense to fly his parents in from California so they could have time with their grandchildren. </s>
<s> husband and I had not gone on a honeymoon because he we got deployed to Iraq the week after we got married. </s>
<s> was so excited ! Mark and I had reservations for one of the junior suites. </s>
<s> had n't gone to Chicago before to be tourists and were looking forward to the view which was offered. </s>
<s> ; when we got to our room ; the view was disappointing. </s>
<s> had requested a non-smoking room and were assigned to one ; but it was obvious to us that someone had smoked in there. </s>
<s> am asthmatic and became very ill. </s>
<s> asked to be moved to another room ; but were told there were no other rooms ' even downgrades available. </s>
<s> was done to try to make up for this. </s>
<s> of my health ; my husband and I checked out within hours of arriving for our romantic anniversary weekend. </s>
<s> is not how I had imagined spending such a special time. </s>
<s> ; when I think of my 10th anniversary ; I will always have this memory to tarnish it. </s>
<s> stayed here for a weekend while visiting some friends in town. </s>
<s> was a little pricey ; but definitely worth it ! The staff was super friendly ; the pool was clean and well-maintained ; and they even had a really good veggie burger in the restaurant downstairs ' I 'm a vegetarian. </s>
<s> ; I paid for a room with a lake view and it was gorgeous. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend. </s>
<s> needed an extra night in Chicago after a gratus stay at The Penninsula and won a SkyAuction bid for The James $ 203. </s>
<s> is one of the nicest hotels that I 've ever stayed in. </s>
<s> aside ; we felt it equalled The Penninsula in comfort and level of service. </s>
<s> echo all of the superlatives previously written and would love to stay here anytime I 'm in town. </s>
<s> husband and I loved this hotel. </s>
<s> staff were friendly ; the food on the room service menu was a reasonable price ; and we got an extra ' free coffeepot in our room immediately when we asked for it. </s>
<s> recommended ! Spent three nights in Chicago at this property. </s>
<s> of all ; I have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the Magnificent Mile close to terrific restaurants ; the Art Institute and Orchestra Hall. </s>
<s> hotel has two sides - the historic tower and a new wing. </s>
<s> rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired. </s>
<s> property needs to be renovated. </s>
<s> observations : The junior suite I had was laid out strangely. </s>
<s> small bedroom and smaller sitting room separated by a corridor off of which was the very large bathroom. </s>
<s> mirror over the sink was not over the sink but skewed to the right - made shaving a challenge and messy. </s>
<s> descending in the elevator one morning ; it started shaking so violently that I could barely stand up. </s>
<s> stopped on the 11th floor and I was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a technician shut it down. </s>
<s> This experience was far more powerful than coffee in helping me wake up - an adrenaline rush certainly cures sleepiness ! Reports from my group were of sinks stopped up ; exposed bolts in rooms ; and generally things not working. </s>
<s> the good news - the staff is terrific. </s>
<s> make you feel welcome ; are personable ; have their own personalities ; great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help. </s>
<s> wish they had a better property to work in. </s>
<s> Chicago Hotel - Last monday my wife and I got back from a stay at the Omni in Chicago. </s>
<s> is a decent hotel ; but I wo n't be choosing it again for our stays in Chicago ' usually visiting family. </s>
<s> room has plenty of space ; easy furniture to relax in ; good layout ; and is generally well put together and comfortable. </s>
<s> faults were more centered around service. </s>
<s> had to wait for a half hour on arrival just to check in ; and ; while I understand they have other customers ; I just got off a plane and just want to relax. </s>
<s> by itself I would n't have minded - but wait ; there 's more. </s>
<s> ordered room service the next day ' day 2 of the 3 day onslaught ; not only did it take us a couple tries for the staff to get our order right ; but then it took a while too ! We were waiting like . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  an hour and a half ; and it was just for a pasta dish and a burger ; it 's not like we ordered a 3 course meal with a salmonentree and a creme brulee for dessert. </s>
<s> only did we have to wait ; the staff was n't apologetic when they did arrive ; and ; finally ; we were n't impressed with the food itself either. </s>
<s> be fair ; it was O. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but I had looked around online and we had really expected more. </s>
<s> website seemed appealing ; and then I got live chat service on the website ; which I was really impressed with ; but I am disillusioned. </s>
<s> fairness to the Omni ; it was quiet ; and a nice place for an adult couple. </s>
<s> were n't many if any families ; and they were all well behaved ; so we did get to relax and unwind in peace. </s>
<s> the price and caliber of this hotel ; we just expected better people interactions. </s>
<s> got a spanking deal at this hotel for $ 99 a night. </s>
<s> 's in a good location to the Loop. </s>
<s> transportation options abound. </s>
<s> gripe comes from the fact that we were obviously put in a " crappy " room. </s>
<s> overlooked the back of the building and the roof of a building next to us. </s>
<s> toilet in the room was not bolted to the floor. </s>
<s> than that ; if I needed to stay in the Loop again for something and I knew I was n't going to be put in a undesirable room ; I would stay here again. </s>
<s> name " Hard Rock " might trigger images of hip rockers but you will be sorely disappointed by staying here. </s>
<s> website alludes to musicians and parties but if you 're looking to hob nob with the rich and famous the Hard Rock falls short. </s>
<s> hotel puts on a kitchy show by the decorations in the lobby and around the property but there is nothing exciting about this. </s>
<s> service is mediocre and the rooms are n't clean. </s>
<s> stayed at this hotel last year for a long weekend in Chicago and was very much looking forward to some fun ; exciting romance. </s>
<s> should have picked somewhere else. </s>
<s> your money. </s>
<s> travelling for business I had my family join me and we stayed at the Fairmont Chicago ; Millennium Park. </s>
<s> is breathtakingly beautiful and plush. </s>
<s> rates for rooms ; though not the cheapest choice are quite reasonable for such fabulous amenities. </s>
<s> room decor is elegant modern and my wife says the spa is divine ! Guests of this hotel are able to live in luxury - every room is equipped with complementary coffee ; access to high speed internet ; bathrobes ; and 42 inch flat screen televisions. </s>
<s> the gorgeous city views and live the good life at the Fairmont Chicago ; Millennium Park. </s>
<s> started when I booked the InterContinental Chicago online at the hotel 's site ; and got a server error. </s>
<s> I managed to get my reservation ; and wish I had looked elsewhere on this great Chicago street ; filled with plenty of other options. </s>
<s> server errors continued at check in and did n't let up. </s>
<s> was on a holiday weekend ; but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers ; and I had trouble getting served. </s>
<s> hotel is enormous and does n't give a sense of comfort. </s>
<s> health facilities are also just too big ; so noisy and crowded. </s>
<s> Internet access was $ 18 a day ; kind of surprising when I can go around the corner to a Starbucks ! Next time ; I 'll pick a more intimate place nearby -- without so many " server errors " . </s>
<s> InterContinental hotel is truly a hidden treasure. </s>
<s> deep in sky scraping steel epicenter of downtown Chicago ; the hotel is a taste of both modern day luxury and old time charm. </s>
<s> the tiled indoor pool surrounded by high Romanesque arching ceilings to the rich mahogany furniture and lace curtains in the suites ; the InterContinental was built to satisfy the taste of even the most hardened traveler. </s>
<s> well in advance as it is one of the most sought after retreats in all of Chicago. </s>
<s> chose to stay at a small hotel because we did were looking for a hotel with less crowds. </s>
<s> anticipated we would get better service in a smaller hotel ; than some of the other larger high rise hotels. </s>
<s> did not experience very good service at the Talbott Hotel. </s>
<s> we checked Irena seemed very robotic and aloof. </s>
<s> front desk clerks were neither welcoming nor gracious. </s>
<s> lobby is small and the front desk is just a few feet from the front door. </s>
<s> time we came into the hotel we were never greeted nor even received a smile from the staff ; just a blank stare and gaze. </s>
<s> front desk staff was chilly and stiff ; no greetings ; no smiles and no personality. </s>
<s> had difficulty answering simple questions or requests. </s>
<s> the other hand the bellman Perry was great. </s>
<s> was sociable and very service oriented. </s>
<s> was aware of what is going on in the area. </s>
<s> recognizes the guests and he offered suggestions about things to do in the immediate area ; and where to eat in the neighborhood. </s>
<s> is authentic and he even asked us upon our return " how was that restaurant ? " Tim the concierge was also supportive. </s>
<s> gave us 10 % discount coupons for shopping at the major department stores. </s>
<s> had the largest suite. </s>
<s> requested a rollaway ' extra charge when we made our reservation and we had to ask five different times to have the rollaway bed delivered to our room before it came after 10PM. </s>
<s> the rollaway finally came we had to call back the front desk because they did not deliver a blanket or pillow with the bed. </s>
<s> made our Talbott hotel experience most disappointing was that we may have never received any housekeeping unless we had asked to have our room cleaned. </s>
<s> were out of our room from 8AM and when we returned to our room at 4PM the rooms had not been cleaned. </s>
<s> called the front desk to ask to send someone. </s>
<s> maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening. </s>
<s> room itself was pleasant. </s>
<s> did have a moldy smell and some Frabreez would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much. </s>
<s> were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin. </s>
<s> really liked staying in this area of Chicago but expected first rate service. </s>
<s> service was very weak and unacceptable for this class of hotel. </s>
<s> you want the downtown experience of a lifetime ; with historical living that will bring you back to Chicago in the early 1900 's look no further ; the dining experience is as comfortable as the stay ; service is immaculate ; and just as you think things could n't get any better ; you are only a walk away from one of the most exciting cities in America : Chicago with fine dining and a late night rendezvous as exciting as the nightlife ; you are sure to have your excitement whims met ; and walk away with the memory of a lifetime. </s>

<s> Customer ; Josh Omni Chicago Hotel - Just got back from a 2 night stay at the Omni great hotel. </s>
<s> ; as a 5 star hotel ; it 's nice. </s>
<s> arrived at 4 : 00pm my first day and was all ready to go right when I showed up ' I had pre-booked and paid. </s>
<s> was helped up to my room - er suite ' should and could only be described as a suite - number 535 ; with my bags it was nice to get the assistance right off the bat when I had been traveling. </s>
<s> room was picture perfect ; in all honesty a little too perfect - felt like I had walked into a commercial kind of prevents you from feeling like you can make yourself at home ; do n't want to mess anything up. </s>
<s> say too perfect as the like lighting and color choices for furnishings were like ; formal professional ; not entirely welcoming. </s>
<s> said the furniture and bed was comfortable ; and the room offers anything you need ; so once you get passed the worrying keeping the room neat ; it 's comfortable enough. </s>
<s> you get what you pay for the price is steep but it 's well worth it. </s>
<s> booked memorial day stay ; which gives you 20 % if you book 2 nights ; add in senior discount ' over 55 and AAA ; and saved me a bit keeping it at only 234 'night. </s>
<s> plus was the courteous helpful service ; as mentioned ; as well as other luxury you get at any good hotel like this one. </s>
<s> hotel is well located ; but the service is poor. </s>
<s> seem to cater to large conventioneers ; with service more like a moderate chain hotel - not your typical Fairmont. </s>
<s> are too many specifics to outline here ; let 's just say that from the front desk ; to the spa ; room service which only got my order correct one-day ; to housekeeping which did n't even clean my room one day ' although they sent a manager to inspect the room because the housekeeper said she did clean the room. </s>
<s> ; that 's just what you want to come home to after 10 hrs of meetings ! They did offer me a complimentary breakfast for my inconvenience ! The hotel is large and many times between 5-7 pm there would literally be a long line of guests waiting for an elevator. </s>
<s> 've stayed at this Fairmont twice. </s>
<s> 1st time I attended a conference nearby and the last time l chose it for the price. </s>
<s> it 's not worth enduring such poor service. </s>
<s> was the last time for me. </s>

<s> Saturday night ; my company held a ball in the Crystal Ballroom. </s>
<s> food was excellent ; the hotel chefs were the best. </s>

<s> overall stay at Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel will be forever in my memory. </s>
<s> was a fun filled weekend with great food ; clean rooms ; excellent maid service and all the hotel personnel were polite and willing to fulfill our every need and want ! We will definitely be staying here again ! homewood suites chicago - I paid $ 300 a night to stay at this dump ; and I 'll never do it again ! The room was small ; the bed was lumpy ; and the maid woke me up at 7am to clean the room. </s>
<s> was n't all bad ; though ; since I was able to be the first to the breakfast buffet. </s>
<s> they remodeled the interior and hired competent staff ; it would be an okay hotel ; but for now you can do better. </s>
<s> was attending a training conference in Chicago and opted to book my own room thru one of the online discount programs rather than stay at the rather sterile and pedestrian hotel where the conference was being held. </s>
<s> booked 4 nights at the Intercontinental and was pleased with the elegance and convenient location ' an easy walk to the conference. </s>
<s> the lobby to the rooms ; this hotel lives up to it 's storied reputation. </s>
<s> The indoor pool seems to be imported from the set of a Busby Berkeley movie ! And even tho I was there for a conference ; the hotel 's location on the Mag Mile and a quick jaunt to restaurants and theaters ; made for a very pleasant stay at a very affordable price. </s>
<s> a good start when the front desk is n't willing to tell their customers that they have a problem with your room ! We reserved a King Suite ; and the hotel put us in a Queen Suite without telling us up front. </s>
<s> after we confronted the Manager did they come clean about the switch ; he offered us a free breakfast ; but would not up-grade our room. </s>
<s> whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the Omni. </s>
<s> will not be retuning to this Hotel again. </s>
<s> Chicago - Stayed at Hilton in March and I must say ; Hilton is not what it used to be ! I had a lot of expectations from this place looking at the prices and reputation. </s>
<s> first look is great ; with all the classic ballrooms and lobbies. </s>
<s> comes the bad part ; the rooms are BIG ; just BIG ; not comfortable. </s>
<s> I noticed a stain on the sheets when I entered the room. </s>
<s> have to pay for the Wi-fi here ! I mean seriously ? ? Almost all the hotels now-a-days provide free Wi-Fi in rooms. </s>
<s> found it very inconvenient. </s>
<s> in all ; go stay somewhere else ; it 's not worth the fortune you will have to pay ! Just got back from a 10 day visit to Chicago. </s>
<s> the rate of $ 219 per night ; it was extremely good value. </s>
<s> staff were efficient ; courteous and very friendly. </s>
<s> was given a room on the top floor ' 32nd floor facing the lake and the John Hancock Tower. </s>
<s> rooms were large and very comfortable. </s>
<s> 'Turn Down Service were efficient and thorough. </s>
<s> amenities were very good and replaced daily. </s>
<s> is definitely my first choice for a Hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> is also very close to all the shops ; restaurants and the subway. </s>
<s> a frequent traveler for work ; I stay at many SPG properties. </s>
<s> to all the SPG property in Chicago ; this is by far the worst. </s>
<s> ? 1 They charge you to use the gym. </s>
<s> 12 per day or something like $ 24 for your entire stay. </s>
<s> ca n't even begin on what a rip off that is. </s>
<s> As a Gold or Platinum member ; you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room. </s>
<s> do not offer that option here and you have to make a fuss about it before they give you one. </s>
<s> They do not have wireless internet. </s>
<s> is 2010- enough said. </s>
<s> charge you at least over $ 200 a night ; all the above amenities should be built into that cost. </s>
<s> would never stay here again. </s>
<s> the gloss of a nice building ; friendly staff ; and a wild set of items in the minibar ; this is somewhat below-average hotel. </s>
<s> particular ; the bed and chairs were some of the least comfortable I ever encountered. </s>
<s> two nights ; my wife and I were practically cripped by bed pain. </s>
<s> complained to the staff and were immediately offered the chance to switch to a different room ; but the other room was furnished identically. </s>
<s> owners of the Omni need to stop spending money on bath salts for the rooms and invest in the basic comforts. </s>
<s> should not be lying on the floor ; trying to unkink my back ; thinking longingly of the last Red Roof Inn I visited. </s>
<s> wife and I checked in to this hotel after a rough flight from Los Angeles. </s>
<s> decided to treat ourselves to a nice hotel while visiting our recently graduated son ; and we were not disappointed. </s>
<s> location could not have been better ; as we were afforded easy access to Chicago 's culture and shopping by being just off Michigan Avenue. </s>
<s> a long day of exploring the city ; we enjoyed a fantastic dinner on the terrace overlooking the city. </s>
<s> halibut was cooked just right ; and our waiter made us feel very welcome with some friendly conversation. </s>
<s> ; I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in Chicago ! Upon check in - the lobby was BUSY ! I was tired and not feeling well from a tough road show. </s>
<s> Front Desk person I checked in with was so fast and so nice that I walked away from the desk smiling . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  that alone was such a great feeling. </s>
<s> time I had any experience with a hotel staff member ; I was so pleased ! I have to say - service really is everything to me and I have to give this top marks for that. </s>
<s> added bonus was the location . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
I just think it is perfect for me. </s>
<s> top of that ; I had a meeting down in the loop ; but not quite sure how to get there - a person approached me in the lobby ; asked if he could help me get to my meeting. </s>
<s> thought he was getting me a taxi - but no - he walked me to his SUV and drove me to the meeting ; " just a free service from the hotel " he stated as we drove . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  really ! so cool ! I have n't even talked about the Pump Room yet - great dinner ; very professional service ; and no attitude. </s>
<s> will return - just up date the rooms a little bit ; thats all . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  the curtains need some help. </s>
<s> big rooms but stinky mildew hallways ; fair room service menu and weird elevator set up really hurt my review on the Omni. </s>
<s> was great but there are a lot of other options. </s>
<s> you get a really good deal on the room ; I would n't say no. </s>
<s> Chicago - The hotel is centrally located but lacks charisma even after renovation. </s>
<s> breakfast at the hotel is unreasonably expensive but there 's a wonderful cafe just after a minute walk towards Millenium Park. </s>
<s> sad part is that the hotel does n't have a swimming pool and had to go to neighbouring health club for that. </s>
<s> design of bathroom is good but a double vanity would have been expected and rooms are ok. </s>
<s> disappointment is truely in service where they brought another brand of wine to the room instead of the ordered one. </s>
<s> they informed first about this ; atleast honesty of the staff would have been appreciated. </s>
<s> seems that time arrived to look for the hotels with better experience and reasonable tariff. </s>
<s> making the obligatory trip to the Chicago area to visit family ; we decided to make it fun for the teenage members of our group and reserved a couple of rooms at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. </s>
<s> a great decision ! The rooms are very upscale at a reasonable price with great amenities. </s>
<s> ; according the younger members of the family ; " very cool " ! We ca n't wait to come back. </s>
<s> James Hotel in Chicago looks nice on the website ; but looks can be deceiving ! The employees are extremely rude and the rooms are disgusting. </s>
<s> would definitely advise against staying there. </s>
<s> We had booked five rooms for a conference in the area and I can honestly say we all felt a bit shafted after our stay. </s>
<s> rooms themselves were comfortable enough ; standard hotel fare. </s>
<s> ; the staff was cold and difficult to get ahold of at times. </s>
<s> most importantly ; the wifi service was not offered for free. </s>
<s> a hotel that caters to those on business ; this is completely unacceptable. </s>
<s> Allegro - I stayed at Hotel Allegro ; which is conveniently located in the heart of Chicago. </s>
<s> here for a business meeting ; I felt slightly indulgent and decided to book this hotel. </s>
<s> my initial hesitation ; I must say that I do n't regret my decision at all ! The staff was amazing and very attentive to my needs ; the concierge asked about my busy schedule ; and every night thereafter I would find some wine delivered to my room ! Nothing felt more relaxing than having my own LCD TV ; using the in-hotel overnight dry cleaning services ; and being in the middle of the theatre district. </s>
<s> done a lot of acting in the past ; I very much enjoyed the Cadillac Palace Theatre ; located so close by ! Overall ; I could n't have asked for a more enjoyable 'relaxing experience !

<s> Avoid this place because after they rip you off once they 'll keep doing it later. </s>
<s> can not be trusted at their word Very Very noisy - Constant water running through pipes. </s>

<s> you must stay here ; try to park for free on dead end street ' feed meter on weekdays and take the stairs down to the next street level and you will find a Jewel grocery store for sodas 'snacks. </s>
<s> A can of soda at the hotel was $ 4. </s>
<s> plus 18 % restocking fee ! Stayed in April for two nights. </s>
<s> hesitated selecting the Sheraton becaue I had a very poor stay there earlier this year. </s>
<s> far as I 'm concerned ; that 's two strikes and I wo n't give them a chance at three. </s>
<s> would n't help on arrival ; huge line at c 'i ; lousy room ; malfunctioning remote ; unresponsive staff ; and incorrect bill. </s>
<s> you want to be close to Michigan Ave ; try the Westin or Intercontinental and spare yourself the problems. </s>
<s> do n't understand why certain places never improve. </s>
<s> it that tough to properly train a staff ? I stayed here for a conference and got the conference rate of $ 149. </s>
<s> was worried that I would n't get a nice room ; since it was the weekend before the election and the hotel is across the street from Grant Park ; so it could easily have gotten a lot more for the nicer rooms. </s>
<s> requested a quiet room away from elevators and foot traffic ; and that is exactly what I was assigned ' perhaps because I am also a ' silver member ?. </s>
<s> was a beautiful room with windows on two sides ; a king sized bed. </s>
<s> room was quiet ; comfortable and immaculate. </s>

<s> traveled to Chicago recently with my giant German Shepard dog Rex and picked the Hard Rock Hotel for the perfect location and because a close friend had warmly recommended their pet friendliness. </s>
<s> service truly is incredible. </s>
<s> even had a web-cam so I could check in on Rex while I was out for dinner in the evening and a friendly staff member took him for a walk when I could not make it home from a meeting the day after. </s>
<s> rooms really rock ' pardon the pun. </s>
<s> like the cheap plastic laminated stained carpet decor so common in other places that allow pets. </s>
<s> easy chair looked so good that I was almost afraid Rex would snack on it while I was out ; but he seemed to like the guitar chew-toy that came with the pet package better. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend the Hard Rock Hotel to my friends - whether they travel with or without pets. </s>
<s> my experience the Ambassador hotel did n't seem to be a 3 1 '2 star establishment. </s>

<s> 11th-floor room was clean and beautiful ; and the view looking north to the Drake Hotel and apartments across the street was nice. </s>
<s> in-room coffee service was appreciated ; too. </s>
<s> is n't a lot of room in the bathroom for your toiletries ; but I 'd still take a room in a beautiful older hotel with character over a spacious-but-cookie-cutter room any day ! We got an outstanding rate by signing up for the hotels website newsletter. </s>

<s> from the start ; Victor greeted us and made us feel welcome. </s>
<s> was easy and our room was gorgeous. </s>

<s> we left ; we shook Victor 's hand ' he 's always there ! and told him we 've found our new Chicago hotel !

My wife and I were there for a week due to a business meeting ; and right when I stepped into the hotel ; I knew that this business vacation will be well spent. </s>
<s> customer service was very great ; and an employee even guided us toward our room ! We were introduced to a fantastically lit room with 2 beds ; a flat screen TV ; and even free internet access. </s>
<s> wife loved it ; and kept on using the free shampoo and body bath soap. </s>
<s> I headed down to the lobby for my conference ; I got lost ; and asked one of the people who worked there where my meeting might be held. </s>

<s> highly recommend that whenever you visit Chicago you should stay there ; you will not regret it. </s>
<s> just returned from a long weekend in Chicago with my wife. </s>
<s> stayed at the Affinia hotel and I ca n't even begin to describe what an awful experience it was. </s>
<s> we arrived at 4pm on Thursday ' check-in is 3pm ; our room was not ready. </s>
<s> had to wait til almost 5pm before we could even get into the room. </s>
<s> inside the room smelled like an ash tray. </s>
<s> someone had deactivated the smoke detectors somehow and had been smoking in the room. </s>
<s> decided to just go out for an early dinner. </s>
<s> arriving back to our room around 9pm ; our key did n't work. </s>
<s> had to go all the way back down to the lobby to get a new one. </s>
<s> next morning the maids started knocking on our door at 7 : 30 in the morning ! Why would you try to clean the room that early ? ? ! The ' do not disturb sign was on our door for the rest of the stay. </s>
<s> that early wakeup ; we went downstairs to request a different room due to the terrible smell in the one we were assigned. </s>
<s> front desk employee gave me a very condescending look and sighed when I asked. </s>
<s> we did get a new room but I did n't enjoy the demeanor I encountered to do so. </s>
<s> new room was fairly nice ; and the rest of the stay was relatively uneventful ; but I have a bad taste in my mouth and likely wo n't stay there again. </s>
<s> Chicago Hotel Stayed here for 2 nights on a business conference. </s>
<s> in my room was unreliable and basically unusable. </s>
<s> I called the front desk about the problem ; they seem confused and were less than helpful. </s>
<s> wifi ; I had to rely on the slow 3G connection on my phone for responding to important business emails. </s>
<s> room also suffered from quite a bit of street noise. </s>
<s> recommend that all business travellers avoid this hotel. </s>
<s> booked two rooms four months in advance at the Talbott. </s>
<s> were placed on the top floor next to the elevators ; which are used all night long. </s>
<s> speaking to the front desk ; I was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor ; which I had requested for a better view. </s>
<s> am looking at a brick wall ; and getting no sleep. </s>
<s> also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor ; and were aware of the noise problem. </s>
<s> then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked ? A request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the TOP floor and using that request to justify this. </s>
<s> you decide to stay here ; request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator ! I spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences. </s>
<s> is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain. </s>
<s> the last minute ; my son and I decided to take a quick trip to Chicago to see the Cubs. </s>
<s> checking Priceline I decided to book the Omni because of the great price for airfare and hotel. </s>
<s> arrived at the hotel around noon and our room was ready 'I had called ahead and requested early arrival. </s>
<s> front desk treated us like we were there best customers-very friendly and accomodating. </s>
<s> room was wonderful with all the modern conviences you would expect in an upscale hotel. </s>
<s> room was spotless and the bed was VERY comfortable. </s>
<s> was not one sign of bed bugs as mentioned in a previous review-maybe those bed bugs were from their luggage and were transferred into their room !We then went to the hotel restaurant and had lunch. </s>
<s> service was great as was the food. </s>
<s> also tried several restaurants around the Omni-all within walking distance. </s>
<s> service ; cleanliness and location of the Omni were incredible. </s>
<s> will definitely go back. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed at The Palmer House Hilton last month to celebrate our anniversary. </s>
<s> a wonderful hotel ! We had such a great weekend ; largely thanks to The Palmer House. </s>
<s> amenity we could want was right there at the hotel ; at our fingertips. </s>
<s> the location is perfect -- right in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> stayed in one of their one bedroom king suites. </s>
<s> was exquisite -- so elegant and beautiful. </s>
<s> was easily the most luxurious suite we have ever stayed in. </s>
<s> service was impeccable. </s>
<s> employee we encountered was both pleasant and eager to accomodate any need we expressed. </s>
<s> had our anniversary dinner at the Lockwood Restaurant in the hotel. </s>
<s> was delicious ! We will definitely return to the Palmer House Hilton for our next special weekend getaway. </s>
<s> 've stayed here before but this time around was a marked difference in quality and service - the staff was n't rude ; just incompetent. </s>
<s> example ; we ordered wine glasses for the room because the hotel no longer services a mini bar in the room ; which seemed like a really cheap way to go for this type of hotel. </s>
<s> ; the staff brought us 4 coffee mugs . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
The list of issues goes on unfortunately ; including the low grade in-room movie options - our audio and video did not sync on our rental ; we eventually had to stop watching after 20 minutes. </s>
<s> the room itself was not clean ; the bathroom sink vent holes were black with mold. </s>
<s> the hotel has pulled back on not only amenities ; but training or sufficient staff . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  oh ; but the price point for this hotel has stayed the same. </s>
<s> a newer hotel ; there are many in this great city. </s>
<s> HOTEL ; CHICAGO - REVIEW Hotel is located in one of the best places in Chicago ; magnificent mile. </s>
<s> the hotel is located in a good location ; it is quite expensive. </s>
<s> rooms are quite normal for the expense price which is $ 197-217 for night in guest rooms. </s>
<s> only restaurant and bar is David burkes prime house and others bars are still in construction. </s>
<s> restaurant allows pets like dog which make it bit uncomfortable and disturbing to other rooms due to barking ; movement of them in the hotel. </s>
<s> the stay was quite ordinary. </s>
<s> worth the price ; even a little bit. </s>
<s> week prior to scheduled check-in ; receiving an email for a room upgrade and accepting ; of course ; upon arrival ; nobody knows about it. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nobody was doing anything about it ; I notified them of this stay 's review will be posted on the newly-developing TheChicagoCritic . </s>
<s> ; all of a sudden they figured out the problem and even offered an early check-in. </s>
<s> little ; Too late. </s>
<s> small room with 2 queens instead of the " Select King " I was supposed to have. </s>
<s> didnt open ; TV took forever to change channels and the bathroom fan was not controllable. </s>
<s> faboulous Lodge Net system that every hotel in the world uses for ease of checkout for guests ; well there was no check out feature. </s>
<s> shit hole could n't hold a candle to the Las Vegas Hard Rock ! This a great property ; excellent location and wonderful staff. </s>
<s> was very accommodating and polite. </s>
<s> room I had was on the 23rd floor and was like a suite ; with a living area and a bedroom. </s>
<s> living room was spacious ; with a plasma TV ; a desk and a couch. </s>
<s> beds were very comfortable and the toiletries of very good quality. </s>
<s> the closed they placed an umbrella ; which came in handy ; it rained the whole time I was in Chicago. </s>
<s> internet connection is $ 9. </s>
<s> '24hrs. </s>
<s> place ; I will return for sure. </s>
<s> it was because we booked thru priceline that we were treated like second rate guest - could n't get a room thru Fairmont website as busy weekend with Ryder Cup . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but never have had this experience in using priceline before. </s>
<s> night time check in girl was rude and unhelpful. </s>
<s> were told no options to pay for upgrade or king bed and that we were stuck with two tiny beds and a ugly room. </s>
<s> had comforter with dirt in several places - and a bathroom for handicap with no counter space - had to use ironing board for toiletries. </s>
<s> hotel is huge and not at capacity - may have had a renovation but the good look of this hotel stops at the lobby. </s>
<s> ; rooms ; carpet run down - just not what you come to expect of a fairmont. </s>
<s> have stayed in many all over the world and this is by far the worst. </s>
<s> because we were on a low floor it was not updated . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> we paid as much as other guest and I 'm a Fairmont Gold member. </s>
<s> - great location ; daytime staff helpful at desk - they have two bikes to borrow which is handy. </s>
<s> could be great if you get a higher room. </s>
<s> out the Raddison Blu across street - looked much nicer ! Stayed at the Chicago Hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door I was very impressed. </s>
<s> was quick ; easy and I was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check-in time. </s>
<s> were given a twin room with two bathrooms which was brilliant. </s>
<s> made getting ready to go out much quicker ! The hotel location is great opposite the park ; which is a must see. </s>
<s> located on South Michigan Ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> also recommend the street one block back from Michigan Ave for good shopping. </s>
<s> breakfast I would recommend grabbing a muffin ; croissant or bagel from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant. </s>
<s> evening entertainment Kitty O 'Sheas is a must. </s>
<s> Irish bar with good drinks and live music. </s>
<s> the bed at Hilton Chicago is the most comfortable bed ever. </s>
<s> would have taken it home if I could ! Definately made for a good nights sleep. </s>
<s> Chicago - This hotel is the worst of the 5 star hotels in Chicago I have ever been. </s>
<s> week ; my husband and I had to live there because other hotels are full those days. </s>
<s> receptionist there was very rude and the doorman even asked us to get the luggage situated by ourself. </s>
<s> room was pretty small that it has only enough space for a bed and the carpet was dirty. </s>
<s> ; one night when I was sleeping ; there was a fight next door. </s>
<s> could n't fall to sleep due to the poor sound insulation. </s>
<s> addition ; the faucet has been leaking all the day ; especially noisy at night and the air conditioning does n't work well ; my husband and I felt so hot in the night. </s>
<s> room and the service is n't worth the money. </s>
<s> would never stay there again. </s>
<s> family stayed at the Hotel Monaco Hotel in Chicago from 2-5 September 2011. </s>
<s> have no complaints about the rooms but I do have to complain about the staff in general. </s>
<s> we checked in the lady at the desk was rude to my children ; take it they were a little loud but it was daytime and she should have never spoke directly to my kids that way. </s>
<s> cleaning crew the next morning did n't even knock at our door before opening the door. </s>
<s> children were still sleeping and I was in the shower. </s>
<s> god my husband was already at his conference. </s>

<s> the moment I stepped into the hotel I felt like I was walking into my own castle and everyone was there to serve me. </s>
<s> in was done in a matter of seconds and the receptionists were very friendly. </s>
<s> only had one bag with me but they still insisted on helping me carry it to my room ; which I loved since I had just had quite a long flight ; and made sure I had everything I needed before wishing me a happy stay in the Hyatt Regency Chicago. </s>
<s> settling in and resting for a while I called room service and ordered some dinner which was provided very quickly and tasted like something out of a 5 star restaurant. </s>
<s> my experience was very positive and I would be glad to return to the Hyatt upon my next visit. </s>
<s> hotel is one superior hotel. </s>
<s> prices are reasonable and the benefits are just fantastic. </s>
<s> husband and I got a package that lets us get a hotel with a view and the view was amazing. </s>
<s> up to seeing Lake Michigan was a site not to miss. </s>
<s> rooms were always cleaned when we got back from our shopping at Bloomingdales or in other places in Chicago ; and the customer service was top notch and very friendly. </s>
<s> though the reviews of this hotel are very good ; the only good thing about it is the Location ; which is excelent. </s>
<s> from that ; there are only 2 elevators ; so there is ALWAYS a wait to get in. </s>
<s> they also seem to have insufficient staff so getting your luggage ; room service ; etc takes forever. </s>
<s> if you arrive in a cab ; there is no space to load 'unload so you have to block the street while you arrive 'depart ; the rooms seem a bit dated and in need of a refresh. </s>
<s> in all ; there are much better options in Chicago I 'll keep it short. </s>
<s> wife ; daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. </s>
<s> go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel. </s>
<s> : It is located in the center of the Magnificent Mile ' Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> ; so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do. </s>
<s> : The hotel itself is very clean ; as were the rooms. </s>
<s> service was excellent ; including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service ' I think they missed a night. </s>
<s> : Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind. </s>
<s> always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile. </s>
<s> night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room ' sometimes chocolates on our pillows. </s>
<s> always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it. </s>
<s> was no shortage of people to ask things. </s>
<s> only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get. </s>
<s> shouuld have more than one ; or longer hours. </s>
<s> : We had breakfast in the 676 Restaurant and it was very good ; and well attended ; appointed. </s>
<s> even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet. </s>
<s> pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids. </s>
<s> was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking. </s>
<s> and changing areas were spotless. </s>
<s> : Clean ; sunny and spacious. </s>
<s> over 400 sq. </s>

<s> - 2 TVs ; couch ; desk ; chairs - all in perfect shape. </s>
<s> windows open for some fresh air. </s>
<s> were pretty comfortable. </s>
<s> all aspects considered ; I think this was an unbeatable value ! I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend. </s>
<s> truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel. </s>
<s> was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there. </s>
<s> has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number. </s>
<s> airlines have cornered the market on that. </s>
<s> have heard friends talking about the Hotel Monaco in Chicago and did have my doubts at first. </s>
<s> when I arrived there was amazed at the location ! It is near so many shopping places ; museums ; theatre ; and many others places. </s>
<s> in town for visiting old family and friends so did not plan to stay in room for long ; however the room was still amazingly clean and well kept entire 6 day stay. </s>
<s> asleep quick in the beds and woke up ready for another day ! The staff at the place is amazing I even got very good directions from them as sadly didnt know the area too well and had plans to meet people. </s>
<s> day did spend the day in room recovering from a long night and the room service was the best I have ever had at a hotel. </s>
<s> and all was highly impressed of this hotel good room ; good service ; and was able to have great time with friends and family by bringing them there and places nearby ; will be heading back to this hotel many times. </s>
<s> Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago - I 'm kind of torn on this one. </s>
<s> really want to give this hotel a good rating. </s>
<s> food and room service were great ; and the room definitely looked fantastic. </s>
<s> I ca n't get over the fact that the beds just feel like one of those old spring mattresses ; you know ? Add that to the fact that the hotel 's proximity to the Magnificent Mile means that there 's lot of noise at night ; and I was tossing and turning for most of my nights here. </s>
<s> considering how important a good night 's rest is ; this makes it really difficult for me to recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> someone who sleeps more soundly than me would find this place better. </s>
<s> ; this used to be a Le Meridian Hotel ; and it has changed for the worse. </s>
<s> kept having to remind them we booked a package ; because we were being over-charged separately for everything ; when it should have been included. </s>
<s> were supposed to have champagne in the room upon arrival ; and did not. </s>
<s> phone calls and three hours later ; it finally showed up. </s>
<s> tried to have a drink in the bar ; and even though we were the ONLY people there ; three servers 'bartenders came and went ; talking to each other ; not one of them acknowledging us. </s>
<s> ten minutes we left the hotel and went down the street for a drink. </s>
<s> do n't bother to pay extra for " City View " ; because you may get the view we had from only the sixth floor ; looking across the street directly into a plain brick wall - that is all we could see. </s>
<s> yes ; the valet lost his cell phone in someone 's car ; and called me at home today to see if we found it. </s>
<s> wanted me to call him back at home. </s>
<s> of the hotel to give out our personal information to the staff ; huh ? For the money ; stay at any other hotel in Chicago with the same price-point and it will be much much better. </s>
<s> wife and I decided to spend three days in Chicago last summer ; and booked via Expedia. </s>
<s> we first walked into the lobby we almost fell over at its beauty. </s>
<s> 's like something out of Europe. </s>
<s> were able to get a free room upgrade ; even though the rooms are still a bit small ; but its an old hotel in an old city. </s>
<s> 's there for sleeping and showering. </s>
<s> restaurants ; lounges ; and shops were all wonderfull. </s>
<s> next time we travel to Chicago ; I 'll be affraid to stay anywhere other than the Palmer House Hilton We travel to Chicago regularly and have always wanted to stay at the Hilton Chicago. </s>
<s> booked a PriceLine room on the weekend of the half marathon. </s>

<s> room was nice and just what we expected. </s>
<s> pool area is also very nice for a downtown hotel. </s>

<s> loved this hotel - reasonable for downtown Chicago ; an older hotel with a great reno ' a bit over-the-top design ; but still very lovely and charming ; clean rooms ; and very friendly staff. </s>
<s> 're also amazingly pet-friendly - they welcomed our 130lb Mastiff cross with a gift bag ' treats and directions to an off-leash area ; and even had a cute blackboard with visiting dog 's names on it. </s>
<s> ; Stayed here for three nights recently ; From check in to check out all Staff members went out of their way to make sure everything was ok and if there was anything they could do to help us ; directions ; restaurants ; transport ; nothing was too much trouble ; The dinner from monday to thursday 5-7 was a wonderful surprise ; also the breakfast was more than adequet ; Stayed on the 15th floor and slept soundly ; Hotel close to everything for the tourist or business traveller. </s>
<s> and shopping all within 5-10 mins. </s>
<s> will not be back to this hotel. </s>
<s> are several reasons for this ; but it began at check-in when the staff were very rude and uptight. </s>
<s> reservation was lost in the system and they seemed to think it was a strain on their time to have to find it. </s>
<s> room was OK ; but the beds were hard and uncomfortable. </s>
<s> room next door had their TV turned up very loudly ; and when we called to ask if we could change rooms were were told that was not an option. </s>
<s> did n't offer any other solutions. </s>
<s> food in the restaurants was extremely overpriced and not cooked to our requests. </s>
<s> ; we wish that we had chosen a different hotel for our stay in Chicago. </s>
<s> Omni Hotels ; Chicago - My experience with the Omni has not been satisfactory. </s>
<s> room service was late most of the times and the fact that the food was not amazing did not make the wait worth it. </s>
<s> rooms were big and clean but the cleaning were not properly trained. </s>
<s> ; a cleanig lady barged into my room without knocking which was irritating. </s>
<s> internet speed was also largely shaky bordering around low speed most of the times. </s>
<s> only good part ; for me ; probably was the gym which was really equipped and beautiful. </s>
<s> the whole ; I would not recommend this hotel for a short stay. </s>
<s> made regular business trips to Chicago ; I decided to stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago ; since it was fairly new and I had a friend that had stayed there. </s>
<s> Lobby was quite small ; which surprised me with a name like Monaco. </s>
<s> a matter of fact I found the furnishings to be quite drab. </s>
<s> boy took my luggage and showed me to the suite. </s>
<s> was two rooms ; not as spacious as I would have liked ; an entertainment room ; and a bedroom with a standard television. </s>
<s> You imagine ; I was expecting H. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; but it was just ordinary cable. </s>
<s> $ 600 a night you would expect a 42 inch set. </s>

<s> view did not take in the Lake ; unfortunately ; just the Magic Mile. </s>
<s> ; I am starving so time to eat. </s>
<s> restaurant was well appointed ; I hope the food was as good. </s>
<s> ordered lamb chops ; potatoes au gratin and mint sauce. </s>
<s> was fair. </s>
<s> hope the rest of my trip si better than my accomadations. </s>

<s> got free wifi and morning drinks by signing up for select guest program . </s>
<s> n't beat that ! the only minor issue is the elevator. </s>
<s> have to take 2 separate elevator trips to get to our room. </s>
<s> got a little annoying when we were going in and out often. </s>
<s> ; it was a great stay ! Hard Rock Hotel boats that they have the best of the high scale accommodations for your business or pleasure stays. </s>
<s> they fail to disclose is just how expensive your stay will be. </s>
<s> service tends to be heavily influenced by the wealth of the patrons ; service is more redily available and friendly the more you make. </s>
<s> rooms are furnished with attractive but old furnishings. </s>
<s> laundry service leaves more to be desired. </s>
<s> sheets have a gray tint to them and the rooms smell of tobacco. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel and was disappointed with not only the service but the cleanliness of the room from the bathroom to the bedding. </s>
<s> stay at any hotel should be memorable and restful-after all isnt that what we pay for ? The Ambassador East is a particularly crappy property ; given the numerous quality hotels in and around the Gold Coast. </s>
<s> ; I saw an amazing rate and decided to book -- this experience will be a reminder that you get what you pay for. </s>
<s> the lobby was gorgeous ' and appears to match the photos on the website the room I was assigned was run down ; and looked nothing like the photos posted on the website. </s>
<s> looked like someone had put a quick coat of paint on the walls ; but the furniture was old and the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty. </s>
<s> room also smelled of must or mildew. </s>
<s> the room did have air-conditioning as advertised ; it was an in-window unit that sounded like it was on its last leg. </s>
<s> was only here for a single night ; but had I been here for anywhere longer I would have requested a refund. </s>
<s> ; if you 're staying in this part of town ; do yourself a favor and book at any one of the numerous other properties around here. </s>
<s> Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn are both nearby ; clean ; and often have special-offers -- these are n't the only properties in the area ; but both of these will save you a potentially unpleasant stay. </s>
<s> was very courteous. </s>
<s> clerk gave only one coupon for the free breakfast instead of two. </s>
<s> desk clerk gave the wrong time for the breakfast on the second day ; causing us to miss the free period. </s>
<s> was very clean ; with a nice view of the river. </s>

<s> only is the rooftop terrace on the 5th floor ; but it was occuppied with private corporate events for the entire duration of our stay. </s>
<s> did - as recommended - have a drink indoors only to be highly insulted by their bartender there. </s>
<s> is no breakfast buffet - you order a la carte. </s>
<s> that in mind when paying extra for breakfast and internet. </s>
<s> note that the minibar is empty on arrival - we were only told on departure that we would have needed to call reception to order. </s>
<s> have stayed at the Omni before and it as a much better experience. </s>
<s> dont recommend spending so much for a mediocre hotel. </s>
<s> stayed in a Deluxe King Suite. </s>
<s> desk to work at or to sit at to eat room service meals. </s>
<s> only table was coffee table height and the couch was some strange futon that was lower than the coffee table ! and canted forward. </s>
<s> uncomfortable to sit at and ridiculous for room service meals or to work at computer. </s>
<s> my room was configured like all the other Deluxe King Suites depicted in on line photos ; I have to assume this design flaw with the couch 'futon runs throughout the property. </s>
<s> was fine and bath was fine but I ca n't imagine why business travelers would rate this property well. </s>
<s> couch 'futon seating is the worst I 've encountered in a modern hotel. </s>
<s> stayed here for business and loved it. </s>
<s> it for $ 93 inc tax on Priceline ; an incredible deal for this hotel. </s>
<s> I was n't on priceline I would expect to pay $ 200 per night ' maybe more for this location 'level of service. </s>
<s> 's in the heart of downtown Chicago ; walkable to many locations. </s>
<s> lobby is very impressive ; the room was very nice. </s>
<s> complaints at all ; from check-in to check-out. </s>
<s> was alone so did n't go to the bar but it looked like people were really enjoying themselves. </s>
<s> was full of people all the time. </s>

<s> found all of the staff very helpful and prompt. </s>
<s> highly recommend the Intercontinental for any travel needs whether it be for business or pleasure. </s>
<s> heating in our room did n't work and was n't repaired depite numerous requests ; the rooms were very small ; the litter in the bin remained in the bin for the whole stay ; the cleaner made the bed but nothing else ; when we returned home my credit card statement showed that the hotel had charged me for the 5 night stay despite my having pre-paid through a travel agent ; it took the hotel 2 months to re-credit my card without an apology or offer to pay for my numerous trans-Atlantic phone calls to them. </s>
<s> stayed at the Fairmont two nights for the SOFA art fair at the Navy Pier. </s>
<s> was impressed that the bellman called us by name when he met the taxi and pronounced it correctly ; which is quite unusual. </s>
<s> smiled and welcomed us. </s>
<s> lobby looks clean and friendly ; not ultramodern ; but not at all tired or worn. </s>
<s> room ; also clean and comfortably furnished ; was larger than we expected ; with a clean ; modern bath and a lovely view of the Navy Pier and the lake. </s>
<s> did not eat at the restaurant ; but it looked attractive. </s>
<s> only problem was that we had asked for non-feather pillows ; upon reserving the room ; upon checking in ; and calling housekeeping. </s>
<s> waiting an hour ; we went to bed. </s>
<s> next day the check-in desk person was extremely apologetic and by the time we returned ; all the feathers were replaced with foam and non-allergenic materials. </s>
<s> hotel is convenient to Millenium Park and Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> would stay there again ; assuming we could get good rates. </s>
<s> Chicago - I wanted to like this hotel . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  it has several things going for it : an elegant modern style ; luxurious furnishings and amenities ; and large rooms with spectacular views - in fact ; almost all the rooms ' except the ones on the western face of the hotel overlook scenic sections of Grant Park and Lake Michigan. </s>
<s> while it was nice to look at ; it was not exactly a pleasure to actually live there. </s>
<s> ; they are either under-staffed or over-booked - the hotel was so crowded when I stayed there last June that noise and service became issues. </s>
<s> lobbies were so full that I could n't ever find a place to sit down ; and they were a chore to wade through as I travelled to and from my room. </s>
<s> staff was reasonably pleasant ; but they just could n't adequately serve all of their guests. </s>
<s> 'check-out took at least an hour ; and I think they managed to get around to cleaning my bed linens only once during my five-day stay. </s>
<s> would have liked to take advantage of the exercise spaces they advertised ; but they happened to be closed for renovation. </s>
<s> two main restaurants inside the hotel ; a grill and an Irish pub ; often had waiting times upwards of 45 min during peak hours. </s>
<s> top it all off ; they were generally too noisy for me to carry on a conversation with the other people at the table. </s>
<s> noise was an even bigger problem at night ; however - between standard city sounds like cars and sirens in the streets and the neighbors talking through the paper-thin walls ; I hardly slept. </s>
<s> there were a few good restaurants near the hotel that I was able to escape to for a bit of peace. </s>
<s> 's at least three different pizza places about a block away ; but if you want something a little more upscale and still Italian ' my favorite ; I suggest you try Gioco as it 's only a bit more of a walk. </s>
<s> ; my experience here was n't horrible ; but I ca n't quite justify the price of admission ; given the spotty service and my issues with the noise. </s>
<s> room cost a steep $ 250 dollars per night ; which I now wish I had spent site-seeing around Chicago while staying somewhere cheaper instead. </s>
<s> you 've got a car ; it 's even worse : parking costs $ 45. </s>
<s> stayed at the Chicago Hilton because it was host to a conference I was attending. </s>
<s> I arrived I tried to find out about the " In Room Fitness " program advertised on the corporate website. </s>
<s> called the 800 reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center. </s>
<s> explained that I was inquiring about the ' In Room Fitness advertised on their website. </s>
<s> put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that I should call the property directly. </s>
<s> did and got the same response. </s>
<s> asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room. </s>
<s> ; this was a problem. </s>
<s> I arrived at the hotel ; no treadmill was available. </s>
<s> I went to tour the fitness room the first night I found that they close at 9pm. </s>
<s> I returned to the center the next day I discovered that they charge $ 13 per day to use the fitness equipment. </s>
<s> pool ; track and locker room are free ; but to use the treadmills ; etc. </s>
<s> you have to pay $ 13 per day. </s>
<s> charge is not noted anywhere -- not on the website ; not in any of the guest service materials in the room. </s>
<s> food for the conference was mediocre ; but the one room service meal I had was pretty good. </s>
<s> one of the conference lunch sessions the wait staff made so much noise we could n't hear the speaker. </s>
<s> HVAC did n't work well in my room and I kept the windows open for most of my three night stay. </s>
<s> beds were comfortable with very nice linens. </s>
<s> tried to get a late checkout ; which was offered on a card in my room. </s>
<s> woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour ; not the 11-2pm range advertised in my room. </s>
<s> best service I received was from the folks in the Security office. </s>
<s> hotel does not have safes in guest rooms ; so I became very friendly with Security office as I locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time I could n't carry it out of the hotel. </s>
<s> visit Chicago at least once a year for personal travel and will continue to stay at the Marriott properties. </s>
<s> wish I had done so for this visit. </s>
<s> thought the Swissotel was a great hotel. </s>
<s> rooms were very spacious and clean ; especially for downtown Chicago standards. </s>
<s> importantly ; the rooms were quiet. </s>
<s> never heard people in the hallways when I was trying to sleep. </s>
<s> only downside was that the beds were not anything special. </s>
<s> ; like all hotels in Chicago ; this hotel caters to wealthy and 'or business clients with ridiculous minibar and parking price. </s>
<s> ; if you are aware of that prior to arrival ; its not a big deal ' ie finding a different place to park the car ; bringing our own snacks for the room. </s>
<s> would be nice though if hotels such as the Swissotel had a microfridge in the room for guest use. </s>
<s> was very helpful. </s>
<s> instantly got cabs upon request ; and the front desk was efficient and helpful. </s>
<s> ; if I can get a good rate again ; I 'll stay at the Swissotel the next time I am in Chicago. </s>
<s> a short time during vacation I had rented a room from The Ambassador East Hotel ; I have to say I was quite impressed with what I experienced and would referre others looking to stay in a hotel to that given location. </s>
<s> hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed ; and trust me I am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot. </s>
<s> food is good ; location is great ; everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here. </s>
<s> Palmer House - 'Warning The Palmer House made a bad on me right away. </s>
<s> was unable to get a shuttle from the airport to the hotel ; and when I called asking about the next one they said that it was not running for the day. </s>
<s> my expensive cab ride to the hotel ; I was dissapointed to see that the room looked nothing like the website described. </s>
<s> was small and crowded with unecessary furniture. </s>
<s> did not sleep well on the bed ; although I am a picky sleeper. </s>
<s> must admit that the atmosphere of the lobby and the common areas of the hotel were very nice ; and I really enjoyed using their gym facilities in the basement ; but that was not enough to make up for my lackluster experience with the customer service and my room. </s>
<s> next time I travel to Chicago I will be trying a different hotel because the Palmer House did not live up to the expectations set by their price and the Hilton name. </s>
<s> travel a lot for business and quite frankly ; my expectations were starting to reach new lows. </s>
<s> usually always choose W Hotels just for the consistency ' of average hotels. </s>
<s> Affinia in Chicago has raised my expectations and W Hotels are going to suffer in comparison. </s>
<s> hotel is one of the cleanest I have stayed at in some time. </s>
<s> was impeccable. </s>
<s> front-desk staff and the extra towels I ordered arrived literally within minutes. </s>
<s> gym has new equipment with plenty of space. </s>
<s> such a fun vibe - without dark hallways and loud music. </s>
<s> have to thank the other reviewers - their reviews led me to the Affinia and I was so pleased. </s>
<s> new " Chicago Hotel " . </s>
<s> will even lead me to try the Manhattan hotels. </s>
<s> you enter the lobby at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel you immediately see that this is a special place where you are going to be pampered. </s>
<s> staff are very friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to assist you in any way they can. </s>
<s> check in process is smooth and friendly as I expected. </s>
<s> you enter your room the decor catches your eye. </s>
<s> yet not stuffy is how I describe it. </s>
<s> restroom tub is large and made of marble. </s>
<s> whole room is tasteful and made to make you feel special yet at home. </s>
<s> highly recommend The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel to anybody looking to escape for a while. </s>
<s> disappointment. </s>
<s> : 1. </s>
<s> alarm clock 'stereo thing was broken in my room. </s>
<s> was constantly emitting low ; changing hissing noises. </s>

<s> there was no off switch on the damn thing. </s>

<s> about an overpriced dump. </s>
<s> the moment I stepped up to the front entrance my luxury service began ! I enjoyed every minute the fairmont ! The King room was spacious and the decor chic !

<s> always prepay online so I literally get my room key in a minute ; never any hassle. </s>
<s> is good ; buffet style breakfast and decent dinner. </s>
<s> better ; there a bunch of excellent restaurants within a few blocks. </s>
<s> only complaint would be that your stay can definitely be effected by what side of the hotel your room is on. </s>
<s> east ; there is a great view of the harbor ; but the westside overlooks a busy street that can be noisy long into the night. </s>
<s> staff is very willing to accommodate any such concerns if you explicitly ask ; but otherwise it can be a bit of a crapshoot. </s>

<s> with that said ; I would recommend HS to anyone coming through the city. </s>
<s> is quick ; easy ; and comfortable. </s>
<s> My wife and I were guests at the Hotel Allego in Chicago for a long weekend getaway ' September 2 - 5 ; 2011. </s>

<s> we arrived ; the hotel staff informed us that the room we requested was unavailable and brought us to a different room that smelled quite moldy. </s>
<s> I asked to be moved to another room ' my wife has asthma we were politely told that we were unable to be switched at that time. </s>
<s> room was not particularly well-cleaned : we found previous guests hair in the bathroom sink and on the floor ; and a film of dust across the television set. </s>
<s> are not the type to complain ; so we went out to explore the city and assumed that would be the worst of it. </s>
<s> nighttime when we tried to sleep ; we discovered the bed sagged terribly in the middle and the walls were so thin ; every nearby conversation could be heard perfectly. </s>
<s> were tossing and turning half the night. </s>
<s> the morning we hoped a quick workout might help energize us for the day ; but we discovered that the wellness and fitness center described on the website was really not at all what we anticipated : a few treadmills and a dilapidated weight rack. </s>
<s> concierge was almost never around in the lobby ' her sign always said " Be right back ! " and when we did ask her questions ; she was actually somewhat cold and rude towards us. </s>
<s> second night was without incident ; luckily ; except for the terrible bed ; but the third night we were woken up three times by hotel staff trying to enter the room to clean despite our " Do Not Disturb " sign. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> husband and I went to Chicago for three nights for a quick get-away. </s>
<s> chose Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park because it was located at the heart of the city ; downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel itself was very elegant and modern. </s>
<s> bed was extremely comfortable and I was able to wake up with music from my iPod. </s>
<s> would definitely stay with them again. </s>
<s> a disappointment this hotel was. </s>
<s> ; the checkin desk was understaffed and we had to wait forever to get through the line to check in. </s>
<s> we finally got up to our room ; we opened the door and found someone else was already in it ! Yes ; the front desk clerk actually checked us into an occupied room and basically gave us a key to someone else 's room. </s>
<s> went back to the clerk who checked us in ' skipping the still present line ; which got us annoyed stares from the other people waiting and told him the problem. </s>
<s> ; he was already helping another guest checkin and made us wait until he was done with that person before helping us. </s>
<s> did apologize for the mix up and then went into the back room to find out what to do. </s>
<s> took a ' very long time. </s>
<s> was a good 10-15 minutes until he came back. </s>
<s> said there were no more rooms available of the type we had booked and the only ones they had left were on a lower floor with no view. </s>
<s> hotel offered us a discount off the regular price for these ; but when we got to this new room ; we found out why these rooms had n't been taken. </s>
<s> room was overlooking the loading dock at the back of the hotel. </s>
<s> briefly considered just leaving and going to another hotel ; but it was late already so we just decided to make do. </s>
<s> was ; of course ; until the garbage truck came around 6am and made all sorts of noise picking up the dumpsters and dropping them back down. </s>

<s> was unimpressed by the quality of this hotel. </s>
<s> overall look of the place was marred by what felt like poor maintenance. </s>
<s> that this is supposed to be a luxury hotel and charges rates at that level ; this was most disappointing. </s>
<s> was I impressed with the snooty attitude taken by the hotel staff. </s>

<s> husband had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room to be in there prior to our arrival . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it wasn 't. </s>
<s> he called to place the order again ; it never showed up. </s>
<s> were so disappointed and surprised by the lack of service that we decided to forgo ordering them for a 3rd time. </s>
<s> room was very small ; drab and lacked the romantic setting we were looking for. </s>
<s> had called to request a room with a large tub ; similar to the ones in the photos ; prior to our arrival ; noting that we did n't mind an upgrade cost. </s>
<s> ; the tub was incredibly small. </s>
<s> have stayed at the Intercontinental in other cities before and had such high expectations for the Chicago location ; especially considering we were celebrating such a happy ; once-in-a-lifetime occasion. </s>
<s> service and amenities just did n't match up. </s>
<s> stayed here for 2 nights in May 2008. </s>
<s> have to say the hotel was exceptionally clean and very modern and funky. </s>
<s> had a free wine tasting each evening ! The restaurant served very good breakfasts and the staff were lovely and helpful throughout the stay. </s>
<s> hotel is located within walking distance to the metro system and also close to shopping restaurants and sights ! Rooms were lovely ; althou the bathroom was slightly on the compact side. </s>
<s> be back. </s>
<s> expectations were not high because I booked this hotel through priceline for $ 58 night. </s>
<s> amazing deal if not for the fact that you had to wait 15 - 20 minutes for hot water. </s>
<s> called the front desk to tell them that there was no hot water - to which they nonchalantly replied : " try running it for 15 to 20 minutes. </s>
<s> " 
They forgot to tell me to keep the water running after my shower ; if anyone else expected to use the shower. </s>
<s> boyfriend ; who showered after me ; had to wait another 10 minutes to get the shower warm again. </s>
<s> make matters worse ; after room service was delivered ; we called and said we needed another fork. </s>
<s> told us it would cost $ 3 $ 1 for the fork ; $ 2 for delivey charge. </s>
<s> ridiculous ! At least with a 1 star hotel ; you get hot water. </s>
<s> is supposed to be a 4 star hotel. </s>
<s> guess you do get what you paid for - I just feel bad for the people who actually paid full price. </s>
<s> ! Loved the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago ! It was so close to all the great sights of Chicago like Navy Pier ; Lake Michigan ; and all the fabulous dining. </s>
<s> hotel was very classy and the rooms were furnished in a traditional ; but cozy manner. </s>
<s> entire family loved it ; even the dog . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> because they are also pet friendly at the Ambassador East Hotel ! We loved the restaurant there ; the Pump Room was great ; something to please even the pickiest of our eaters. </s>
<s> were there on a family get-away ; but asked to see a larger " suite " . </s>
<s> suites were gorgeous. </s>
<s> ca n't wait to tell our friends about this place ! Our next business trip to Chicago ; we are booking at this hotel. </s>
<s> have the perfect conference rooms and we LOVE the service ! We are definitely coming back ! As a frequent traveler to Chicago ; I generally stay at the Sutton Court ; but thought I would try a different boutique hotel. </s>
<s> will never stay at this hotel again. </s>
<s> first room they brought me to -- their standard room -- was a glorified closet ; leaving me absolutely claustrophobic ! Actually the smallest hotel room I 've been in in the U. </s>
<s> ! I complained to the front desk ; who then moved me to a " premium " room -- still quite small ; but manageably so. </s>
<s> bathroom was tiny ; without a vanity ; making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room. </s>
<s> location leaves much to be desired ; as my room looked out directly onto the El ' elevated subway - background noise ; and the street was pretty deserted on a Sunday evening. </s>
<s> will say that the free wi-fi was great. </s>
<s> you can find a chain or other hotel closer to Michigan Avene ; I 'd highly recommend you take that. </s>
<s> you want a nice room in a great location ; check out Sutton Place hotel instead. </s>
<s> can easily say this is one of the worst hotels I 've stayed at the. </s>
<s> receptionist up front was a snooty ; sarcastic teenager or post teenager. </s>
<s> can get better service from a waiter or waitress at a diner. </s>
<s> room was dirty ; stains on the carpet ; the showerhead was moldy and rusted ; the doors of the bathroom and main door all had dents and scratches. </s>
<s> towels had a horrible aroma. </s>
<s> hotel is very narrow ; so we were near a construction zone so ; I would plan on waking up at 6 : am if you choose the Talbott. </s>
<s> next day ; I asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room. </s>
<s> room though was right by the elevator and it was torture hearing the sounds of the elevator which just would never stop. </s>
<s> asked for late checkout at 1pm and the receptionist refused stating that we would be charged for a half day ; if were not out by noon. </s>
<s> had to speak to the manager who gave us till 1pm. </s>
<s> stay away from this hotel ; I think a Holiday Inn would be better. </s>
<s> F. </s>
<s> Gulli I am so glad I decided to stay at the Intercontinental Chicago for my first trip to the city. </s>
<s> staff is very attentive ; I felt like I was the only person they had to take care of ! The location is great ; right on the Magnificent Mile and so close to major attractions. </s>
<s> suite was well appointed and very clean. </s>
<s> even looked behind some furniture for dust and could n't find any. </s>
<s> hotel is very luxurious. </s>
<s> sheets and towels were very soft and the bed very comfortable. </s>
<s> next time I travel to Chicago ; I will definitely stay at the Intercontinental again. </s>
<s> have to say that the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago is a cool place to stay. </s>
<s> I first got there ; getting checked in was very fast. </s>
<s> lady at the counter was nice and well spoken. </s>
<s> bellhop had out bags into the room very fast. </s>
<s> room was very hip and cool. </s>
<s> was musical items all over the place. </s>
<s> really loved the Beatles art that was in my bathroom. </s>
<s> being in the room a few minutes ; I got a call from the front desk asking me if I liked my room. </s>
<s> also asked me if I would be interested in things like spa treatments and or if I needed to use their business room. </s>
<s> needed some things shipped while I was there ; which they had supplies to help me with that. </s>
<s> getting some work done ; I called the concierge if there was some really good pizza places around. </s>
<s> gave me information for 3 awesome places. </s>
<s> left and came back after having a night out on the town. </s>
<s> were very understanding that I was a wee bit out of it. </s>
<s> had more than pizza that night if you get my drift. </s>
<s> I got back to my room ; the bed was so comfortable. </s>
<s> feel right off to sleep and had a good nights sleep. </s>
<s> the morning I order breakfast ; which was really a Philly cheese steak. </s>
<s> will make anything you want anytime of day. </s>
<s> checked out by 9am with my bags feeling rested and very relaxed. </s>
<s> You Hard Rock ; You Rock ! We booked thru hotwire which we have a high percentage of positive outcomes. </s>
<s> was very happy when we saw that we would be staying at The Knickerbocker-as I had stayed when I was younger. </s>
<s> reserved a King Non-Smoker. </s>
<s> arriving we were told that they did not have that and we only had the choice of a Smoking room. </s>
<s> argued they stated " well you booked thru hotwire so you do not have priority " . </s>
<s> we entered the room I noticed the bathroom door was off track and the bathroom light did not turn on. </s>
<s> called the front desk and they fixed the door but not the light. </s>
<s> that eveing as I took a shower the seal around the shower was so poor water got all over the floor and towels. </s>
<s> ; I must add the room reaked of smoke. </s>
<s> next day when we checked the front desk clerk asked how our stay was and when we told him the problems ; he told us the total and had not concern of our issues. </s>
<s> also checked in our bags for the day ; and the bellmen came quickly and made very rude comments about us hurrying up so he could get on with his day. </s>
<s> realized a bit later that we forgot something in one of the bags and was told they would not get them back out. </s>
<s> AWAY-even if you get a good deal ! This review has two parts. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> advise reading both. </s>
<s> One : The actual hotel and staff I found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating. </s>
<s> room was nice and clean as well. </s>
<s> have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff. </s>
<s> is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the South to reach the riverfront ; or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the North. </s>
<s> easy ' one block walk from the subway ' Red line. </s>
<s> morning complimentary breakfast is substantial. </s>
<s> just muffins and coffee. </s>
<s> can have a complete breakfast here if you want. </s>
<s> ; even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel IF based solely on the physical location ; the room ; and the staff. </s>
<s> Two : The nightmare I booked this room through central reservations in July for a mid-September arrival. </s>
<s> rate was quoted to me as $ 159 per night for four nights. </s>
<s> the confirmation was emailed to me ; it was incorrect by over $ 300. </s>
<s> immediately called the hotel. </s>
<s> said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount. </s>
<s> did receive the corrected confirmation email. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> done ? NO. </s>
<s> week later ; my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged. </s>
<s> called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve. </s>
<s> I explained the error ; I was literally called a liar by the person in reservations ; and told " That 's not my problem. </s>
<s> ca n't help you " . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and then told that I have to pay the higher amount. </s>
<s> ME ? Now ; I go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance. </s>
<s> a few left messages ; I get the general manager to call me back ; and discuss the issue. </s>
<s> taking down all of the names of people I spoke with ; he assures me that he will credit the account immediately. </s>
<s> even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> week later ; still no credit. </s>
<s> ; I call the general manager again. </s>
<s> ; this might take up to 72 hours to process ; I am told. </s>
<s> ; please give it another week. </s>
<s> week passes ; still no credit. </s>
<s> another call to the manager. </s>
<s> am told now that the credit HAS been processed ; and he even sends me an email confirming our " agreement " for the credit ; just to appease me. </s>
<s> week passes. </s>
<s> ; not seeing that credit that was " definitely processed " a week ago. </s>
<s> another call to the general manager on the day before I am to leave on my trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> told him I will be arriving ; and at this point ; I want to see him personally ; and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while I am there. </s>
<s> ; we are now talking SIX WEEKS and this is still not resolved. </s>
<s> arrive at the hotel ; and to make a long story short ; the general manager was NEVER available to see me ; nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me. </s>
<s> only person I spoke face to face with ; was the assistant general manager. </s>
<s> was completely unconcerned with my situation ; and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of " you realize this boils down to a matter of ' he said she said " . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ? ? ? ? Today ; my trip is over ; and I have flown back home. </s>
<s> STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT ! I will absolutely be reporting all of this to Hilton Corporate Customer Service ; and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point. </s>
<s> this little adventure into consideration when dealing with this hotel. </s>
<s> have n't actually stayed at this hotel- yet- but am already disappointed in their customer service. </s>
<s> visit Chicago quite often and usually stay at the InterContinental ; but yesterday I read some online articles advertising The James Hotel 's " Cyber Monday Special " . </s>
<s> promo states that if you buy a gift certificate from their website ; the hotel will match that amount in " James Credits " that can be used toward your stay. </s>
<s> of the articles gave an expiration date for these credits. </s>
<s> next trip to Chicago is in April ; so I thought I 'd give The James a try. </s>
<s> travel frequently with my pet and I 've heard they have a very liberal pet-policy. </s>
<s> today I went online and bought a $ 500 certificate. </s>
<s> ; having the one track mind that I do ; somehow missed the part about the credits expiring March 31 ; 2010. </s>
<s> realized my mistake immediately and called the hotel front desk to explain my predicament. </s>
<s> said I could n't be in Chicago until April ' I 'm overseas on business until then ; and asked if they could extend my credits an extra month ; or it not ; refund my gift certificate purchase. </s>
<s> had only just made the purchase minutes before and had n't even recieved my email confirmation yet. </s>
<s> businesses offer a 24 hr grace period. </s>
<s> girl at the front dest was extremely rude to me- basically saying " too bad ; it 's your problem now " . </s>
<s> did n't even bother to act polite or pretend to be sympathetic about my situation at all. </s>
<s> now that I know this is the kind of service I can expect from The James ; I might just call it a wash and stay at my usual hotel ; or try Hotel Monaco. </s>
<s> hear they have great service and are good with pets too. </s>
<s> hotel is the best hotel ever in my opinion ; and I really enjoy everything thing about it and I also have many different reasons why I like this hotel. </s>
<s> the entrance to every details on the inside all the way up to the rooms ; everything seems to pocess some kind of style to it and not forgetting such a modern feel it has. </s>
<s> completely am astonished by this building and if I had to pick one to compare with this one I really would go for this one. </s>
<s> 's like a person would have to see it to believe. </s>
<s> has a lot of modern designs. </s>
<s> you and this is my review and it 's real. </s>
<s> Rock Chicago - We stayed here in one of the Deluxe King Rooms - last May ; on the recommendations of some friends when visiting Chicago ; and we had a great time. </s>
<s> were stylish ; and very cool. </s>
<s> from most other hotels ; so if you like Rock music and that kind of lifestyle it might be for you. </s>
<s> were clean ; and staff was efficient. </s>
<s> was good. </s>
<s> real problem was that with such a steep price ; having such expensive parking and wi-fi seemed a little much. </s>
<s> sure to rent the Fender guitars ; if you have some musical talent. </s>
<s> is free ; and for somebody like me who only has a cheap nothing guitar at home ; it honestly may have been the highlight of the trip. </s>
<s> way too much time just fiddling around with the guitar in the room. </s>
<s> they took $ 372 off my card ; even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night. </s>
<s> had no business taking the money off of my card. </s>
<s> on the 28th Sep I contacted them and they admited to the mistake. </s>
<s> is not a month later and I have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back. </s>
<s> I booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel. </s>
<s> I looked a week later ; they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate ; so two of my friends did n't come to the trip away. </s>
<s> I asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken ASAP as the dollar was weak against the pound. </s>
<s> about 8 phone calls over 5 months ' each saying they would they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional PS150. </s>
<s> ; the hotel was nice and in a nice location ; but I will never be staying there again due to all my problems. </s>
<s> arrived at the hotel 15 minutes prior to check in time as they recommend. </s>
<s> I get there I noticed that there is a couple and two other people waiting in line to check in. </s>
<s> minutes later after standing there with my suitcase ; the woman at the front desk informs us that their computers are down due to a recent update to the software. </s>
<s> told us to wait until the computers booted back up. </s>
<s> asked if I could drop my suitcase off at the room and she said no because they need to electronically activate the cards and with the computers down they could n't activate the cards. </s>
<s> another 20 minutes later the computers were up and I finally got my room. </s>
<s> the " luxury " in waiting 35 minutes for a room ? They also need to change the name of the hotel because their service did not leave me " allegro. </s>
<s> " 
Hilton Chicago - " Complimentary WiFi. </s>
<s> " 
Yeah there 's internet ; if you can even call it that. </s>
<s> it takes five minutes to load google ; I wonder how long it will take to access your emails ? I do n't know ; because I gave up trying. </s>
<s> I went to front desk and asked if there was any option of a paid faster internet and apparently there wasn 't. </s>
<s> decided to cancel my stay then and there. </s>
<s> lines at the check in desk were tremendously long so we decided to use the computerized self check in. </s>
<s> only option the self check in gave us was the size of the bed. </s>
<s> we got to our room ; we immediately realized we were placed in a smoking room but we were unable or perhaps the staff was unwilling to move us to a non smoking room. </s>
<s> am allergic to the smoke and that made my stay uncomfortable. </s>
<s> walls seemed thin and we could clearly hear the conversations of the guests in the rooms next to us. </s>
<s> we went to breakfast ; we were seated quickly but it was nearly ten minutes before our server arrived. </s>
<s> the price they were charging ; the wait was unacceptable and we went elsewhere. </s>
<s> also took ten extra minutes than promised for the valet to get our car. </s>
<s> forty dollars a day for parking ; we expected better. </s>
<s> stayed at the Hilton Chicago during a recent business trip. </s>
<s> elected to go with their Executive Suite upgrade. </s>
<s> I can say is ; " What upgrade ? " It 's barely anything above what you get normally. </s>
<s> for the price I paid ; I was expecting much better acommodations. </s>
<s> I arrived around 10 : 30 the night I checked in ' delayed flight I did not get the concierge service as it stops at 10. </s>
<s> find that an odd hour to stop a service like that especially when you 're expecting a guest who has not checked in yet. </s>
<s> that ; it took them 20 minutes to get me into my room. </s>
<s> it was a room mix-up ; then it was a missing key card. </s>
<s> was extremely frustrating as I was tired and I had a presentation to give the next morning. </s>
<s> of the next morning ; the complimentary breakfast was a joke. </s>
<s> I just want a stale muffin and a bad cup of coffee for breakfast ; I 'll stay at the next Super 8 I find. </s>
<s> the wireless internet in the room that you actually have to pay for on top of everything else was a horrible connection with angonizingly slow speed. </s>
<s> will not be staying at the Hilton Chicago every again even though I frequent Chicago. </s>
<s> tops out my list of horrible hotel experiences by a long shot. </s>
<s> Amalfi Hotel Chicago-I recently stayed there for 2 but really HATE it ! It is very pricey with 150 dollars a night ; but only provides 50-dollar worth of quality. </s>
<s> neighborhood is so noisy that I could hardly fall asleep at night. </s>
<s> desk never answered phone calls and they only cleaned my room when I requested them to do so. </s>
<s> never book the hotel again. </s>
<s> friends and I were in Chicago last month and were looking for a resonably priced hotel in a decent neighborhood. </s>
<s> we came across the Hotel Allegro and immediately fell in love ! Everything from the colors ; the staff ; the architecture ; and the pricing were AMAZING ! We could n't have found a better hotel. </s>
<s> service was impeccable . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> talk about a 5 star hotel for someone with a 2 star budget ! My friends and I plan on staying here next year when we return . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
I ca n't wait until then ! The Talbott is definitely not worth the price you pay. </s>
<s> was really looking forward to staying here since it was recently renovated was in a good location. </s>
<s> ; it just did n't live up to the hype. </s>
<s> Recently renovated " apparently means it was redone in the last decade ; not the last year. </s>
<s> was just very tired-looking. </s>
<s> very disappointing was the food ; and the service was hit or miss. </s>
<s> expected better from a hotel of this caliber. </s>
<s> line ; there are better places with better value. </s>
<s> elsewhere. </s>
<s> 3rd ; 2007 My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel toward the end of September 2007. </s>
<s> hotel is VERY modern. </s>
<s> room was immaculate ; but the furiture looked as though it came from IKEA. </s>
<s> was chipped in many places. </s>
<s> light switches were difficult to find ; and the HVAC made noise. </s>
<s> ; the bed was wonderful. </s>
<s> bathroom was large and well maintained. </s>
<s> brought us as many towels as we wanted. </s>
<s> restaurant was small. </s>
<s> can eat for less at a 24 hour restaurant around the corner called Tempo. </s>
<s> you want a truly great breakfast try The Peninsula Hotel. </s>
<s> ; after dining there you might not want to return to The Sofitel. </s>
<s> to checking in we had paid for everything in full. </s>
<s> we checked in ; we were asked to leave a credit card for incidentals. </s>
<s> returning home ; we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the Sofitel had an authorization placed on it. </s>
<s> reduced the line of credit ; and it took several days to be removed from the card. </s>
<s> location ! Reasonable value. </s>
<s> you have a Privilege Card they allow you to check out at 4pm as opposed to 12 in the afternoon. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago ; IL ; and boy was I surprised. </s>
<s> hotel looks nice from the outside but the smell from the river is noxious. </s>
<s> fact ; the smell was so bad one night that it almost made it difficult to sleep or even think of eating. </s>
<s> if this were not enough ; the bathroom of my room looked like it had n't been cleaned in a month and their were stains on the " fresh " towels. </s>
<s> the end of my stay I saw a mouse on the ground floor and could only imagine what other critters may be lurking in the walls. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Affina Chicago hotel and was really dissappointed. </s>
<s> I arrived ; the desk clerk was really slow checking me in. </s>
<s> feel like turtles could have checked me in faster. </s>
<s> was finally checked in and my room was on the 8th floor. </s>
<s> elevator ride seemed to take forever. </s>
<s> arrived and the room and at first glance it looked great ; but after looking everything over there were finger smudges on the glass table. </s>
<s> figured maybe room cleanin must have accidentally touched it. </s>
<s> went to the C-House for supper that evening and I had to wait for what seemed like forever. </s>
<s> meal was good ; but my waitress was very uptight. </s>
<s> my way back to my room ; I asked the front desk to set up a wake up call for 6 AM the next morning and they were very grateful to set that up. </s>
<s> would have been nice to actually get it though. </s>
<s> next morning I surprisingly work up at 7 : 18 AM and realized that I had not received a wake up call. </s>
<s> was very upset and let them know. </s>
<s> this experience was not worth the 4 stars that this hotel has been given. </s>
<s> the price ; quality and ratings the Affina Chicago hotel has been given ; I would expect better service. </s>
<s> husband and I decided to plan a romantic get-away for our one year anniversary when we stumbled upon the Talbott Hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> decided to book the " Personally Yours Romance Package " for our stay. </s>
<s> we arrived at the hotel ; the staff was very friendly and approachable. </s>
<s> personalized key cards we received upon check-in were a wonderful touch. </s>
<s> night ; we would return to our suite to find the linens turned down and rose petals scattered across the bed. </s>
<s> personal concierge even helped me plan a special outing for my husband and I to see a Chicago Cubs baseball game. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a weekend away. </s>
<s> friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for a weekend while visiting a mutual friend of ours for her Birthday. </s>
<s> hotel at first glance was very nice and charming. </s>
<s> ; We quickly found out that was not the case. </s>
<s> room reeked of smoke when we first stepped in. </s>
<s> bathroom was filthy ; it looked as though it had not been cleaned in weeks ! There was mold around the toilet and a film over the mirror. </s>
<s> were also very large stains all over the carpet through the room. </s>
<s> immediately called the front desk to tell about our smelly ; unkempt room. </s>
<s> women at the front desk was rude and assured us that what we were smelling " was not smoke " because that is not permitted in the hotel. </s>
<s> were also told that room was cleaned that day. </s>
<s> several minutes of arguing with her and a manager ; we were moved to a another room which took 2 hours because there were no other clean rooms available at that time. </s>
<s> had to sit in the lobby with our baggage until one was made available for us. </s>
<s> food we ordered from the restaurant was horrible and WAY over priced. </s>
<s> waiter was rude and only stopped by our table twice the whole time we were there. </s>
<s> the staff at this hotel seemed unhappy and barley even acknowledged any of the guests. </s>
<s> will never stay here again and I would never recommend this hotel to any one. </s>
<s> Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was everything you could ask for in a hotel. </s>
<s> was meticulously clean ; very orderly ; but still perfectly warm and comforting. </s>
<s> rooms are very big and spacious ; and the beds are so soft ; it 's like heaven ! I did n't test out the room service ; but I 'm sure it would be just like everything else . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  perfect !The hotel staff are just so nice. </s>
<s> was a spectacular view from my room ; and looking out over the city at night is so magical. </s>
<s> are resturants that are easy to access from the hotel ; and I especially recommend Shula 's Steak House. </s>
<s> ; I had a fantastic stay at The Sheraton Hotel ; and I would definitely stay there again ! Having traveled to Chicago on business once before ; I was looking forward to spending some vacation time in the city and wanted to have the best accommodations for my trip. </s>
<s> some research ; I decided that the Palmer House Hilton sounded like the perfect place to stay. </s>
<s> ; in a way ; it was perfect -- perfectly awful. </s>
<s> reading some positive reviews and checking out the hotel 's website ; I was expecting a luxury room that was a notch above the ordinary. </s>
<s> ; my standard guest room ; which the hotel 's website describes as " deluxe ; " was very bland and generic and reminded me of rooms I had stayed in at budget chain hotels ; not pricier historic hotels ; such as this one. </s>
<s> carpeting looked dingy ; so I had to wear shoes or slippers any time I walked on it and there was a gap in the curtains that made it impossible to block out the sunlight in the morning -- or the horrendous view of a brick wall that I had from my window. </s>
<s> addition ; the sink in the bathroom dripped constantly and was an annoyance all night long. </s>
<s> cost extra ; including the gym ; the pool and the spa ; and the restaurant prices were outrageous. </s>
<s> hotel is overpriced ; overrated and definitely subpar. </s>
<s> would n't recommend it to my worst enemy. </s>
<s> stay at the Hotel Monaco recently was fantastic. </s>
<s> got a very reasonable price for our stay ' especially since we were a AAA member ; and there was plenty of perks to utilize ; in-room spa treatments and an evening wine wine hour to name a few. </s>
<s> thing that the kids really enjoyed was that ; upon request ; the staff brought us a fish in its own fishbowl for our room. </s>
<s> cool is that ! The staff were all very helpful and friendly and our stay was very enjoyable. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend the Hotel Monaco to anyone in the downtown Chicago area. </s>
<s> three night stay at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was the perfect way to end a weekend. </s>
<s> hotel has a classy but warm atmosphere with color tones that please the mind and soothe the eyes. </s>
<s> staff was ready to help at any notice and always greeted you with a cheerful smile. </s>
<s> mySpa was the getaway of a life time. </s>
<s> only complaint would be that the bed covers were a bit too stiff as they were new and clean but the softness of the bed whisked me away to a deep slumber in no time. </s>
<s> worth the money and I know my next stay will be much longer. </s>
<s> location of the hotel is great ; right on the river and Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> everything is within walking distance. </s>
<s> the price ; though ; and given the 4 star hotel ; we expected better walls. </s>
<s> room was connected to other rooms on both sides by locked doors. </s>
<s> sound from both rooms came in loud and clear. </s>
<s> heard our one neighbor making business deals on his phone ' he clearly was n't speaking loudly ; and the other neighbors up at midnight yelling and screaming when they came back drunk. </s>
<s> asked them to be quiet ' I should n't have expected that to work with some young drunks then called security ; but they did nothing. </s>
<s> was completely annoyed with the noise ; especially in an expensive business hotel such as this one. </s>
<s> you are in Chicago to party ; get drunk ; and not get any sleep ; I would n't stay here. </s>
<s> was on a business trip to Chicago a while back and I had the unfortunate luck of staying at the InterContinental Chicago Hotel. </s>
<s> say unfortunate ; because from the first moment I walked in my experience was poor. </s>
<s> front desk made me wait a very long time and I had to resolve an issue with my reservation. </s>
<s> receptionist had made the reservation and the room should have already been on or company account but they were insisting that I supply a personal credit card for the room. </s>
<s> understand their precautions but I travel a lot and usually do not encounter this situation. </s>
<s> that was all taken care of ' several phone calls later I was taken up to my room. </s>
<s> was nice and I was glad to finally be there ; but the bell hope was very short with me and was very quick to throw out his hand asking for a tip ; even though he had done nothing but groaned the entire time he was taking me to my room. </s>
<s> was very happy I only had to stay there two night because after my run in with the front desk I got the impression that no one wanted to deal with me. </s>
<s> will hopefully not be staying there again ; and will suggest that it be avoided by all. </s>
<s> Suites is a Hilton Group Hotel located in downtown Chicago. </s>

<s> we arrived at 5 pm ; well past check-in time ; our room was not ready for 30 minutes. </s>
<s> management apologized but did not offer any sort of compensation for our inconvenience. </s>
<s> the suite was ready ; it was nice. </s>
<s> then we quickly discovered that there was no hot water in our bathroom. </s>
<s> were relocated to another room with apologies ; but again ; no offer of compensation for the trouble. </s>
<s> we were finally settled ; the free welcome dinner reception had wine and beer. </s>
<s> food was okay ; but we were so frazzled from the issues we had checking in that anything would have tasted good at that point. </s>
<s> staff suggested their complementary grocery shopping service. </s>
<s> though it was a good idea since we were already so tired. </s>
<s> ; it took them three hours to finally deliver the groceries to our suite and the bill was far more than we expected. </s>
<s> in all we were disappointed with our experience at Homewood suites. </s>
<s> understand there are problems that may arise but the fact that the management did nothing to make it up to us is unacceptable. </s>
<s> would not suggest this hotel to a friend visiting Chicago. </s>
<s> chicago - Stayed in a corner king room overlooking the city. </s>

<s> only qualm I had was that for the price ; I expected the room to be more spacious. </s>
<s> boyfriend and I wanted to spend a four-day weekend in downtown Chicago and do all the touristy things ; shop the Magnificient Mile ; see Shedd aquarium ; go to the museum of Science and Industry. </s>
<s> Suites was conveniently located near all of these things. </s>
<s> was a luxurious treat of a weekend ! We even swam in their rooftop indoor pool. </s>
<s> was also nice to have the amenities of a suite ; so we could prepare our own meals some days. </s>
<s> staff was friendly and courteous ' they even gave me an extra pillow on request ! and we would definitely stay there again. </s>
<s> stayed at the excellent Affinia chain in NY ; I had very high expectations. </s>
<s> I saw the Trip Advisor rating ; I immediately booked. </s>
<s> a huge disappointment : -- The quality Simmons pillow top mattress is covered with very cheap ; foam pillows -- the kind they sell in the store for $ 4. </s>
<s> can not sleep on these -- The windows are so thin ; you can hear the buzzing from walk 'do n't walk sign on Superior below. </s>
<s> The walls are so thin that when my neighbor smoked ; I was awaken around midnight ; my room engulfed in smoke odor. </s>
<s> call downstairs yielded no results -- There are nice furnishings but many are chipped showing bare wood ; the desk chair was full of loose threads -- The water flow is very weak ; but the towels are nice -- There are unpainted floorboards ; the kind you find in Day 's Inn -- They charge for internet service The tiny lobby has materials and pictures of what the hotel will eventually look like. </s>

<s> ? ! I was floored ; but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride ; was too tired to make a fuss. </s>
<s> were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night ; so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple. </s>

That night ; our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms. </s>

<s> returned to the room after 5pm to find that the dried blood was still on the floor. </s>
<s> making a complaint to the customer service I have gotten no reply from the hotel. </s>
<s> the price point of this downtown hotel I would think that they would try to live up the 5 star rating but instead they have failed miserably. </s>
<s> there are many hotels to choose from in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> Rock Hotel Chicago - I could n't stand the Hard Rock Hotel. </s>
<s> problem is n't the rooms per se. </s>
<s> are pretty attractively layed out ' as the hotel website endlessly repeats ; and my room had an excellent view through the windows. </s>
<s> even remembered to position the bed so that the light from the windows does n't shine right in your eyes in the morning ; which I always look for as curtains never completely block out the light. </s>
<s> bathroom in my room also did n't point towards the bed ; so when my wife used it in the middle of the night the light did n't wake me up. </s>
<s> the rooms and the hotel generally are fine ; the real problem comes from the stylish " Hard Rock " atmosphere. </s>
<s> get a little bit of a feel for it on the website ; but it 's even worse in person. </s>
<s> is just too cool and hip for words. </s>
<s> you 're like me and just want somewhere quiet to sleep ; stay away from this place. </s>
<s> stayed at the Sheraton Chicago hotel for a business meeting and had an absolutely horrible experience. </s>
<s> i arrived ; exhausted after a series of delayed flights ; I was told that my room was not ready. </s>
<s> ready at 5pm ; are you kidding me ! After waiting in the lobby for 30 minutes I was finally called over to the desk only to be told my king room was changed to a room with two queen beds ; fine ; whatever. </s>
<s> get up to my room and unload all of my bags only to find my a 'c does n't work. </s>
<s> call down to the desk and the clerk tells me that they are sold out and there is no where to move me but she could discount my rooms $ 20. </s>
<s> apology. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> exhausted and deal with my 80 degree room. </s>
<s> I went to check out the next morning I find out no one even bothered to apply the discount. </s>
<s> ; no apology. </s>
<s> have never received such poor customer service in my life and will not be comming back. </s>
<s> have just returned from a week at the James Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel is fabulous ; very chic and chilled. </s>
<s> service is beyond compare. </s>
<s> in and out were swift and painless. </s>
<s> Concierge service is also super efficient having located an excellent hair salon and a couple of fab restaurants for us during our stay. </s>
<s> hotel restaurant itself is rated 5 in the top 10 in Chicago - voted by Chicago residents. </s>
<s> stayed on the 14th floor with great views of the city. </s>
<s> room ' a deluxe king was equipped with a great selection of cocktail making lovelies ; hairdryer ; safe ; tv ; robes slippers ; a very interesting selection of minibar items ' one of which was a real surprise ! including crisps 'snacks a first aid kit and an umbrella ! We also had a spotless and elegant bathroom with Kiehls products and a cosy little dining area. </s>
<s> ipod dock 'CD 'radio and complimentary chillout CD were a nice touch and husband liked the enormous plasma tv. </s>
<s> super comfy bed ensured a good snooze and complimentary WiFi allowed us to plan our next day 's activities from our bedroom. </s>
<s> were so busy touring around the city we did n't get an opportunity to use the gym or the spa - both of which looked fab. </s>
<s> bar 'lobby area is a haven of civilised tranquility with smooth music playing in the background to help you chillout that bit more. </s>

<s> visit to Chicago I 'll definitely be staying here and would n't even consider an alternative if The James can maintain these standards. </s>
<s> are my experiences : - Had three rooms reserved ; when checked in we were charged 2 different rates for the rooms - screwed up initial room assignments ; gave us a room that was not even cleaned yet when we checked in - Could not get us new keys to a different room without great difficulty ' we had to go to the front desk because bell staff went to the wrong room to give us new keys - In room guide says pool in on the 8th floor and signs say it is on the 7th - could not get to the pool from the 14th floor without going all the way down to the lobby and then had to go to the 7th floor and take the stairs to the 8th - When we checked in we had the front desk staff go over which credit cards were assigned to which room. </s>
<s> When we received our bills ; the credit card assignments were still wrong. </s>
<s> stay at " economy " hotels a lot and I have not even come close to having this many problems with a hotel until this one. </s>
<s> hotel should do Chicago a service and just close its doors. </s>
<s> to this experience ; I will never stay downtown again to deal with overpriced hotels with poor service and surrounding business that are just as bad. </s>
<s> booked my weekend Chicago stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago because of the location as well as some good reviews I found online. </s>
<s> ; my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel fell short of my expectations. </s>
<s> I arrived ; well over an hour of check in time ; I was told that my room was not yet ready and I was left awkwardly waiting around for another half an hour as I did not want to leave the hotel again before settling in. </s>
<s> hotel staff I interacted with seemed generally uninterested in their jobs ; and while I do appreciate that this is a hip hotel popular with a younger crowd ; there was an excessive amount of noise on the floor I was staying on throughout the night until about half past four in the morning when it quieted down ' after two calls to the front desk to make complaints about this issue. </s>
<s> I am a fairly light sleeper ; I woke up several times throughout the night. </s>
<s> would recommend bringing earplugs if you 're also a light sleeper but would like to get in some decent sleep. </s>
<s> the hotel looked very nice ; but I just felt that my experience was not worth the amount I paid for my room. </s>
<s> are so dark we had to insist they bring lamps so we could see. </s>
<s> room we had at almost $ 400 a night was dingy and small. </s>
<s> n't mistakingly think the Hard Rock Cafe is there ; it isn 't. </s>
<s> have a Chinese restaurant that is overpriced and limited on items. </s>
<s> room service menu is broken down in terms of times you can order certain foods. </s>
<s> my wife wanted a milk shake we had to call the Manager to have it made since the kitchen staff said it was n't a choice. </s>
<s> Rolled Roast beef sandwich was listed under the 2 am choice and they refused to make it untill again ; we called the Manager who did get it to us. </s>
<s> staff did appear friendly ; although housekeeping totally disregarded our ' do not disturb sign and would call us on the phone. </s>
<s> n't make the mistake of staying here but if you do ; walk across the street and buy snacks you want because even a soda is $ 3 plus 19 % gratuity. </s>
<s> ended up having to order delivery food brought to us. </s>
<s> is the most overpriced ; over rated and dingy hotel we 've ever stayed in. </s>
<s> to airport is $ 40. </s>
<s> ; so first trip to chicago and I was a litlle worried about the hotel and the location ; finally I decided on the CONRAD and wath a good experience i had ; I booked a king deluxe room on the 6th floor ; view was not amazing but that was the only coplaint i could had ; room is nice ; bath was all appliances and good size ; good plasma tv ; free internet ; we asked one day for breaksfast and amazing food ! so overall and for the price aroufn 220 It was a great surprise ; the locating was very good a few blocks from everything and very quiet hotel Well located and well staffed. </s>
<s> Amalfi was a clean and comfortable place to stay. </s>
<s> lacks a restaurant or bar but many are near by. </s>
<s> continental breakfast and evening cocktail. </s>
<s> stepping foot on the hotel propety I could tell it was a negative place ; Seeing as how there was what apperd to me to be Vice Lords all aroung the property. </s>
<s> that i have a personal problem or affelated with another gang ; It 's just the way they was acting ; drinking the hotels cheepest wine ; they could of been there for securaty purpouses like the hell 's angels was to some concerts. </s>

<s> smelled like a cretan type of burning wood that i have smelled ; only later to find out it was the smell of rock cocine. </s>
<s> looked at the pool only to find there was no watter and scateborders all around the place. </s>
<s> being a high class bizness man ; I decided to leave. </s>
<s> I was asked to stay at the Swissotel in Chicago ; I immediately went to their website to check them out. </s>
<s> I found there was decent ; nothing really stood out. </s>

<s> amazing customer service I received there was exceptional. </s>
<s> whim and detail I asked for they helped me perfectly. </s>
<s> room was neatly fixed when I arrived and was cleaned every day. </s>
<s> I asked about more towels ; the maids were happy to help me out. </s>
<s> I were ever to be in that area again ; I know exactly where I 'm staying ; the Swissotel. </s>
<s> stayed here August 20 through 23rd with my sixteen year old son and we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. </s>
<s> price was very reasonable for a hotel located right on Michigan Avenue. </s>
<s> front desk and concierge service was excellent and enhanced our stay by making it easy for us to plan fun activities. </s>
<s> John Entwistle theme on our floor was a nice touch. </s>
<s> of you single fathers out there can appreciate how difficult it can be to take a fun affordable vacation with your children and The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago really helped me accomplish just that ! Great hotel ! Went to see the Museum of Contemporary Art which was great ; but this hotel almost had it beat ! The rooms ' and even halls are very beautifully done. </s>
<s> service too. </s>
<s> Do n't stay here ! My family and I stayed here for a weekend trip. </s>
<s> staff were rude and acted like we were bothering them. </s>
<s> rooms looked nice in photographs but when we got there our room looked like it had n't been dusted in ages. </s>

<s> Omni Chicago Hotel I am a business woman who travels a great deal out of a month ; therefore ; my accommodations must meet the highest standards. </s>
<s> was booked for a stay at The Omni Chicago Hotel ; located in what is referred to as The Magnificent Mile in the greater Chicago area. </s>
<s> Magnificent ; it was ! The beautifully red-bricked sky scraper was indeed a breath- taking sight and upon entrance ; I had a felling of warmth from the very hospitable welcoming staff. </s>
<s> was impressed with the hotels special rates offered during prime business hours and the guest rooms ranged everything from The Presidential Suite to The Governors Suite . </s>
<s> accepted a more humble room as I would not need to spend very much time there during the day. </s>
<s> did stay inside most nights and the amenities were more than satisfactory. </s>
<s> enjoyed the very spacious exercise room and afterwards ; I would take a quick dip in the pool. </s>
<s> toured the hotel as my niece is planning her wedding and just so happens to live close to the hotel. </s>
<s> Chagall Ballroom ; was elegant enough for such an occasion and reeked of pure luxury. </s>

<s> Hotel Name - Omni Hotels Positive Deception - The locality of Hotel is really great ! Right in the heart of city within walking distance to malls and theatre is a plus. </s>
<s> rooms are very clean and staff is well trained and extremely helpful. </s>
<s> had a family reunion in Chicago and the place could n't have been more pleasant. </s>
<s> in heart of city ; we could easily find parking space at the hotel valet parking. </s>
<s> food was really amazing and the cuisine we were served had authentic spices in them. </s>
<s> had pets along with us and they were also really nicely taken care of. </s>
<s> the only disappointment was when I did a checkout. </s>
<s> were charged for the internet usage for not being member of hotel loyalty member group. </s>

<s> location is superb too ; attached to Nordstrom and Northbridge mall. </s>
<s> n't wait to go back ! I truly am not the sort of person to write a negative review about an establishment ; but my time spent at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago forced me to do so. </s>
<s> was to be our first trip to Chicago since I was a boy so my wife and I were very excited to arrive and begin our short weekend getaway as soon as we checked into the hotel. </s>
<s> I must say that the counter help was far less than helpful. </s>
<s> apparently confused person who was to sign us in was extremely out matched when it came to the workings of the hotel computer and was total inept at customer service. </s>
<s> said we had not reserved a room ; which I had weeks earlier ; and proceed to explain to us that his hotel does not make mistakes of this kind and that WE must be mistaken as to the reservation or the hotel or both. </s>
<s> the manager arrived after I insisted on his presents. </s>
<s> did straiten out the confusion ; but the room we were lead to was much smaller than we were lead to believe and had not even been cleaned from the last occupants. </s>
<s> called down to the front and demanded that the manager walk himself to our room and see the condition of the place. </s>
<s> were shown to another room ; this time to our liking. </s>
<s> that point on nothing and no one that we saw or had contact with worked or acted as one would expect from a hotel with the reputation that the Affinia had. </s>
<s> list just a few ; the television was a 13 inch black and white which could get only 4 channels ; the food that room service brought up was cold ; lifeless and bland ; the cleaning person knocked at our door at 5 in the morning every morning even with the ' Do Not Disturb sign on the door ; and there was this ever so slight smell of mold and vomit which passed through the hallway every time my wife and I lift the room. </s>
<s> be blunt ; I truly hope that the CEO of the company reads this note and fires the entire staff ; guts the building thoroughly ; and is publicly flogged in a downtown park. </s>
<s> WILL NEVER STEP THROUGH THE DOORS OF THE AFFINIA AGAIN. </s>
<s> Chicago - I got a rate of $ 194 ; more than $ 50 cheaper than the normal rate by booking a few weeks in advance ; but even at the normal rate of around $ 250 ; its still a bargain. </s>
<s> rooms were big and comfortable with sparkling clean bathrooms. </s>
<s> amenities were changed daily with efficient housekeeping that kept out of our way. </s>
<s> view outside ; even only on the twelveth floor ; is quite stunning. </s>
<s> the complimentary breakfast was actually a real meal with a huge variety of food rather than the standard milk and cereal offered pretty much everywhere else. </s>
<s> only small complaint is the rather expensive parking at $ 45 a day. </s>
<s> boyfriend and I got a great last minute deal on a room here. </s>
<s> ; the discounted rate mea n't a discounted experience apparantly. </s>
<s> room smelled weird like wet dogs ; many of the furnishings were stained or cracked ; the bed was not very comfortable ; and the window overlooked the back of the building ' not the nicest view. </s>
<s> will say that the location was great though and staff friendly. </s>
<s> sure it was worth it though ; even at the discounted rate. </s>
<s> husband and I were really looking forward to spending our anniversary at the Conrad hotel. </s>
<s> the price we were paying we were expecting a luxurious hotel with all the amenities unfortunately it was quite the opposite. </s>
<s> arriving we were greeted by a rude and incompetent receptionist. </s>
<s> only could she not find our reservation due to the fact that she kept misspelling our name ; but she refused to apologize when she finally did find them and acted as if it was our fault she could n't spell ! Our room turned out to be okay except for the stain on my pillow case which ruined the experience for me. </s>
<s> ate at the restaurant on site and were less than impressed with the food. </s>
<s> was alright but nothing out of this world. </s>
<s> felt we could have gotten a better meal elsewhere. </s>
<s> in all the Conrad was a big disappointment to both of us. </s>
<s> husband and I were sorely disappointed in this hotel. </s>
<s> had requested a non smoking room ; and right off we were hit with the stinch of stale cigarettes when we opened the door. </s>
<s> front desk was not responsive to our needs at all ; but we did finally get moved to a new room. </s>
<s> water pressure in the shower was hardly enough to get the shampoo out of our hair and the beds were lumpy. </s>
<s> was very disappointed in the workout room ; it was very small so I decided to swim laps instead ; but when I got to the pool it did n't look like it had been maintained all week. </s>
<s> to say we wo n't make the mistake of staying with Homewood Suites again. </s>
<s> comes a little late as I 'm finally catching up on my reviews from the past several months : A dear friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in late October 2007 for one night while visiting a friend and her husband from out of town. </s>
<s> hotel is perfect ; IMO. </s>
<s> check in and check out. </s>
<s> ; clean ; comfortable rooms with great views of the city. </s>
<s> know this area pretty well and it 's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. </s>
<s> had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there 's even public transportation right near by but we did n't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. </s>
<s> ; as is usual for Chicago ; was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly ' however ; we left on a Sunday morning ; not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day ; so a bit busier than usual I would think. </s>
<s> problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $ 100 through Hotwire ; a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel. </s>
<s> Hotel Chicago - I had a really good time staying at Amalfi hotel. </s>

<s> hotel is located in downtown Chicago so it 's walking distance to most of the sightseeing. </s>
<s> will definitely stay at this hotel if I come back to Chicago in the future. </s>
<s> stayed in the Amalfi in July 2010 ; 4th of July weekend. </s>

<s> the vehicle was returned to me the valet driver did not let it idle down and cool the turbo off as I had instructed. </s>
<s> I tried to start it ; it was n't happy ; but did finally start. </s>
<s> was so relieved to get it back I just wanted to leave. </s>
<s> away I noticed that the top speed recorded on the GPS was 105mph ! ' previous top speed was 95mph ; done a few days earlier driving across South Dakota. </s>

<s> hotel was well staffed with individuals who were knowledgeable about both the hotel and the surrounding area. </s>
<s> would not hesitate to stay here again and plan to return with my wife for a weekend. </s>
<s> 'd expect a " luxury " hotel to pay more attention to details. </s>
<s> room really had n't been thoroughly cleaned -- I found hairballs under the bed ; the mirrors were streaked ; etc. </s>
<s> desk staff took forever to even acknowledge me when I was checking in ; three of them ; two on the phone ; and nobody even made eye contact for 5 minutes. </s>

<s> did n't need to drive ; take a cab or jump on the L the whole weekend since the hotel is centrally located. </s>
<s> easily walked to bars ; blues clubs ; restaurants ; the hancock tower ; the loop and the waterfront all from our hotel. </s>
<s> highlight of the hotel was the complimentary happy hour. </s>
<s> top-shelf drinks and wonderful meats ; cheeses ; peppers ; and breads. </s>
<s> ran from 5 : 30 to 7 : 00 ; and was a great warm-up to a nice dinner. </s>
<s> alone saved us a bundle in money that would of been spent eating and drinking out in the evening. </s>
<s> an extra money-saving tip . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> park at the self-park lot 2 blocks west of the hotel on Kinzie. </s>
<s> $ 24 per night during the week and only $ 6 per night on the weekends. </s>
<s> think the hotel charges $ 30 to $ 40 per night to park. </s>
<s> three nights at the hotel for a girls weekend. </s>
<s> staff was wonderful ; room was beautiful and location great. </s>
<s> can take the train directly from Midway and walk one block to the hotel. </s>
<s> close to museums and restaurants. </s>
<s> have stayed here before and it always proves to be a great choice for a trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> there is ever a Hotel you should stay at it is the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. </s>
<s> is the most beautiful Hotel I have ever seen. </s>
<s> Hotel has more than you will ever need or want. </s>
<s> can pick from a room that is decorated in great taste. </s>
<s> is a in room refreshment center ; high speed Internet ; 32 inch television ; coffer maker with great coffee from Starbucks. </s>

<s> you want to sight see in the area you can walk to the Navy pier ; or Art Institute. </s>
<s> you come back hungry you can eat at the elegant steakhouse which had some of the best food we ever ate. </s>
<s> a few drinks at the great bar ; then create your own burger at the Chicago Burger Company. </s>
<s> staff was very friendly and super helpful. </s>
<s> Hotel was the cleanest I have ever seen. </s>
<s> will come again and again. </s>
<s> big thumbs up to this great Hotel. </s>
<s> a Hilton hotel I was very unimpressed ; the rooms are incredibly small ; there are no refrigirator or coffee machine for coffee or tea. </s>
<s> costs an arm. </s>
<s> side there is a Starbucks at the bottom ; but only limited opening hours ; the lobby is very nice. </s>
<s> is decent. </s>
<s> had such a horrible experience when I stayed at Omni Chicago Hotel last Saturday night. </s>
<s> of all ; the plasma TV in my room was broken and the staff said they had no other rooms available ; and they were n't particularly apologetic about it ; either. </s>
<s> ; it was supposedly a non-smoking hotel ; but as an ex-smoker ; I can tell that people had smoked in the room recently. </s>
<s> ; the indoor swimming pool was closed due to high chlorine levels ; which was really disappointing ; because I was looking forward to using the pool. </s>
<s> ; check-out was supposed to be at noon. </s>
<s> 11 : 15 am ; the maid was knocking at the door. </s>
<s> asked if I would be out soon ; and I thought was very quite intrusive. </s>
<s> will never ; ever stay at that place again. </s>
<s> Ambassador East Hotel is a terrible place to stay. </s>
<s> of the rooms are old and dirty as though they have n't been cleaned or remodeled for years. </s>
<s> hotel staff is not friendly or accomodating. </s>
<s> not waste your money in this crappy old hotel full of rude employees. </s>
<s> will be the only hotel I will never forget in my life. </s>
<s> Monaco Chicago has the best staff and also the rooms are also nice. </s>
<s> if it 's a King Delux Room or a Tranquility Suite ; all of the rooms are luxorious and are themed based ; so it suits ones personality. </s>
<s> if you are a super sized person ; like me with a height of 6 " 4 ; there are special " Tall Rooms " just for you. </s>
<s> days went very fast when I stayed there becuase there was so much to do there. </s>
<s> the mornings I would do yoga from the Yoga Channel. </s>
<s> I would go downstairs and drink one of their complimentary coffees while reading the morning newspaper. </s>
<s> I go to a meeting ; I would get my shoes shined by their complimentary shoeshine service. </s>
<s> I come back from the meeting ; I would go to their fitness rooms and workout on their fully-equipped machines. </s>
<s> just did n't want to leave that hotel ; so I decided that the next time I come to Chicago ; I will surely stay at Hotel Monaco Chicago. </s>
<s> stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the Chicago Bears Fan Convention ' Feb 27- March 1. </s>
<s> hotel is beautiful. </s>
<s> had a Towers room. </s>
<s> had a decent view of the city ' Sears Tower. </s>
<s> room was a little small but had two bathrooms ' 1 King bed. </s>
<s> Tower room has it 's own registration area and comes with a free continental breakfast ; evening snacks and free sodas throughout the day. </s>
<s> registration lounge is on the 24th floor and overlooks Lake Michigan. </s>
<s> hotel was full but service was excellent. </s>
<s> location is convenient but there are a number of homeless people within a block or two ' especially toward the El train. </s>
<s> loved our stay at this hotel and never had to take a cab or rent a car. </s>
<s> will stay here again. </s>
<s> offered a Sunday night free on their website with a 3 day stay. </s>
<s> made the cost reasonable ' for Chicago. </s>
<s> ; the Pavilion restaurant left a lot to be desired. </s>
<s> pub on the first floor was a good place to hang out and have a drink. </s>
<s> Allegro Chicago is a beautiful place. </s>
<s> was originally dreading being in Chicago due to the fact it was all business and no play ; but as soon as I saw the inside of the hotel I was stunned ! I was n't expecting to stay at a place that made business trip feel like a get-away vacation. </s>
<s> service there was amazing ; everybody was very friendly. </s>
<s> I saw my room ; once again my jaw almost dropped. </s>
<s> room was fit for a king ; the designs on the wall were so elegant. </s>
<s> beds were extraordinarily comfy. </s>
<s> think for my next business trip I am going to bring my wife and kids with me. </s>
<s> give this Kimpton Hotel 5 '5 stars ! James Chicago - My visit to the James Chicago was one of the best trips I have had in the past year. </s>
<s> is a truly ' Luxury Liberated kind of experience. </s>
<s> the staff to the rooms ; the restaurant ; spa - the whole package is the real deal. </s>
<s> very ambience is liberating. </s>
<s> contemporary feel to the entire hotel - whether its the furniture or the organics or the electrics or the wall pieces in the rooms or art in the hallways ; it is completely relaxing. </s>
<s> food at the restaurant was just delicious. </s>
<s> amazing part was we could watch the waiters and the chefs at work. </s>
<s> the rooms were very clean something to be expected of ; in a luxury hotel ; I 'd say. </s>
<s> had to pay separately for the valet parking and the room service and such other tiny extra stuff ; but then ; it 's a luxury hotel - and these tiny charges are totally expected. </s>
<s> regrets on that front. </s>
<s> only thing that could have been better is the location. </s>
<s> was a lot noisy during night - probably due to the hospital close by and we could hear the ambulances a lot. </s>
<s> heck ; one can not expect everything right ? Really satisfied. </s>
<s> I was going on a 3 day personal trip to Chicago ; and I decided to indulge myself a bit this time around. </s>
<s> chose to stay at the Talbot ; an upscale hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> start off ; I was NOT pleased. </s>
<s> the hundreds I pay a day ; I expected an impeccable hotel. </s>
<s> ; the check-in process was bad as somehow it took them nearly 15 minutes to find a reservation I had placed nearly A MONTH in advance. </s>
<s> customer service they claim. </s>
<s> ; when I went to my room ; I found that room service had not cleaned it at all. </s>
<s> was forced to wait as they called up a maid to entirely reclean the room as it was strewn with used towels and such. </s>
<s> summary : yes ; it was a fancy hotel ; yes it had nice accommodations ; but the service I experienced there was simply not up to par with a hotel of that price. </s>
<s> expected a glamorous room and I walked into a disappointment. </s>
<s> and Management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel. </s>
<s> you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms does n't go down past 74 ; the closet is 24 " wide ; all old 'dirty brass fixtures ; beds that are a little bigger than a twin ; showerheads that barely put out water ; then this is your hotel. </s>
<s> might be spoiled by staying in Marriott 's ; but I stay in hotels 1 '3 of the year and was severly disappionted. </s>
<s> free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again. </s>
<s> Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown I was tricked by the pictures on their website and believed their rooms were big and clean. </s>
<s> turns out their room is big but NOT CLEAN AT ALL. </s>
<s> bed smells dusty and the carpet in the bedroom has these disgusting dark dots. </s>
<s> bathroom looks old and gives me a feeling that no one lives here for a long time. </s>
<s> hotel is in a good location ; and maybe that 's why it is so noisy. </s>
<s> advice : if you want a clean and quiet place to have a good rest ; do n't go there. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel last weekend and I felt compelled to write a review about this wonderful hotel. </s>
<s> have to say I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the beautiful decor of this hotel. </s>
<s> to mention the friendliest and most helpful staff I have ever encountered. </s>
<s> frequently stay at hotels for business but have never had such a wonderful experience as I did at the Omni Chicago Hotel. </s>
<s> the minute we walked in the beautiful front doors to the time of our check out we were absolutely treated like royalty. </s>
<s> is one hotel that I would definitely rate 5 stars. </s>
<s> can be sure ; I will absolutely be back in the future. </s>
<s> Palmer House Hilton is an incredible break from the real world. </s>
<s> lobby is a throwback to the grand era of travel ; and you can just imagine people stepping off the train with their steamer trunks. </s>
<s> lobby is luxe and gilded ; with soaring ceilings and is staffed with friendly ; accommodating employees. </s>
<s> rooms are plush ; with each bed furnished with a Serenity Dreams topper for extra comfort. </s>
<s> room decor is modern and sleek ; a world from the tacky furnishings in most hotels. </s>
<s> your convenience ; there 's a fully-stocked business center ; pool ; fitness room and workout area - something to accommodate the solo ; business or family traveller. </s>
<s> Chicago would be one of the worst hotels I have ever been to in my life ! Even though i noticed that the design of the place was extremely artistic ; its service quality and hotel conditions were horrible. </s>
<s> gave me a room in which the blankets were dirty and looked as if it been used just moments ago ! I figured it was because the hotel was busy but I started to notice that the furniture came with a cost in service. </s>
<s> television was not working at all. </s>
<s> was extremely disapointed ; especially when coming from a rigorous day of work and just wanting to relax. </s>
<s> ; i settled in doing my work instead of frittering my time doing noting when i got the next disapointment. </s>
<s> Wifi was a bust. </s>
<s> nothing to do but to stare at the furniture or just stare at the wall. </s>
<s> am never going to James Hotel ever again ! The James hotel is located close to everything in Chicago ; the miracle mile ; Pizza House Uno ; Rush street ; The Water Tower everything. </s>
<s> walked everywhere because everything was close by. </s>
<s> rooms are very modern and a little on the small side. </s>
<s> the bed was very comfortable ; Very ! The service is very good and the calls are answered professionally and nicely. </s>
<s> service was very fast and through. </s>
<s> lobby is a liitle small but that keeps the riff raff from hanging out in it ; the bar service was good. </s>
<s> drink prices were high but what do you expect in a hotel bar. </s>
<s> got a great deal from leading hotels of the world for my stay of 3 days was just over $ 400. </s>
<s> for a 5 star hotel that 's cheap. </s>
<s> to the location ; price and service I may stay there again. </s>
<s> I think my next trip may take me to Trump 's hotel in Chi Town. </s>
<s> James is a good stay . </s>
<s> doorman at the hotel are Great ! Always pleasent ; with a smile and very good service. </s>
<s> friendly staff - and helpfull with whatever ? you may have. </s>
<s> n't miss the wine bar and the hot chocolate bar. </s>
<s> rooms. </s>
<s> for business and for theatre guests. </s>
<s> little quiet area during weekends. </s>
<s> 3 nieces and I stayed here for a long weekend ; we had a wonderful time. </s>
<s> arrived early around 8 : 30am and they let us into our room. </s>
<s> was very nice otherwise we would have had to store our luggage and register later Room was very clean as was the bathroom. </s>
<s> 4 women we needed extra towels ; they brought them up right away and then we got a call to make sure they were delivered. </s>
<s> was also quiet ; construction going on behind us and we never heard anything. </s>
<s> comfy and so were the quilts . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
Good location for Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> in all a wonderful stay. </s>
<s> return. </s>
<s> booked a room at this hotel expecting great accommodations considering the price but was disappointed. </s>
<s> room looked nice ; but I found that there were n't any extra blankets in the closet and the heating system was dysfunctional. </s>
<s> came back to the room after a meeting and found that it still had not been cleaned even though it was the late afternoon. </s>
<s> asked for replacement towels and they were very late in coming. </s>
<s> would have expected there to be a shuttle of some sort to the airport ; especially since the website advertises the close distance. </s>
<s> ; I had to call for a taxi and was almost late for my plane because the taxi was stuck in traffic. </s>
<s> in all ; not the best experience at all. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed here for New Years eve weekend. </s>
<s> is an excellent hotel in an excellent location. </s>
<s> is very tastefully decorated and warmly welcoming. </s>
<s> rooms had the best electronics I 've ever seen. </s>
<s> that they had a soaking tub and a spacious shower stall. </s>
<s> hotel restaurant seemed to be empty everytime we walked by ; so we avoided it too. </s>
<s> at Joe 's across the street - excellent seafood. </s>
<s> you can shop til you drop without going outside ! Nordstroms and four story mall is attached. </s>
<s> of good " food on the run " places in there. </s>
<s> Chicago - loved the Conrad. </s>
<s> will go back ! I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel. </s>
<s> was my first time staying at this hotel and ; I am sorry to say ; it was my last time staying there. </s>
<s> of my main issues with this hotel was the amount of noise. </s>
<s> walls must be very thin because lying in bed at night I could hear my neighbors in the next room talking. </s>
<s> I could not quite make out the words of their conversations ; I could definitely hear their voices as more than just a murmer. </s>
<s> addition ; I was awakened several times by people conversing in the hallway as they walked by my door ; presumably on the way to their rooms. </s>
<s> ; I am a light sleeper ; but this was ridiculous. </s>
<s> you decide to stay here ; I suggest that you check your bill very carefully before check out. </s>
<s> I checked mine ; I found that I was being charged a rate higher than the one that I was supposed to be charged. </s>
<s> had to wait in line at the front desk for someone to help me ' and the front desk service is woefully slow and finally had to ask to speak to a supervisor before the error could be corrected. </s>
<s> ; though I had been told upon check-in that my room had been recently updated ; I can not believe that statement was accurate. </s>
<s> room appeared to be rather dated in its furnishings and decor and the carpet appeared to be somewhat worn. </s>
<s> in all ; I round my stay at this hotel to be disappointing. </s>
<s> time I will arrange to stay elsewhere. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the amalfi hotel in Chicago and was very disappointed right from the beginning. </s>
<s> girl at the front desk was busy talking to a one of her friends and when i finally did get her to wait on me she was rude and seemed bothered to have to wait on me. </s>
<s> room wasnt at all what i was expecting. </s>
<s> was dingy ; dirty ; and just seems like an old hotel. </s>
<s> not what i was looking for in a nice hotel. </s>
<s> like the quality you 'd expect from a cheap motel. </s>
<s> Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in the downtown area is advertised as a four-star luxury hotel. </s>
<s> ; modern architecture and a convenient location seem to be its only reliable perks. </s>
<s> service is available 24 hours a day ; but offers a limited variety of items and often lethargic service. </s>
<s> bars are located on the premises ; which is appealing at first. </s>
<s> inside ; patrons do not receive the quality of service that is to be expected and there is a complete absence of privacy ; of any kind. </s>
<s> guest rooms are relatively spacious and clean ; but a lack of adequate toiletries and personal items can interfere with a guests routine. </s>
<s> additional towels and grooming products is much too difficult. </s>
<s> you are a traveler who is in search of a relaxing and hassle-free experience ; with reliable customer service ; booking a room here is probably not a viable option. </s>
<s> Rock Hotel Chicago - Convenient location of the hotel was the only good thing about my stay at Hard Rock. </s>
<s> room ; squeaky mattress ; uncomfortable pillows and noise from the hallway. </s>
<s> course ; I did n't feel well rested at all the next morning. </s>
<s> complained about the noise to the staff but all I got was a pair of earplugs. </s>
<s> was definitely not worth the money to stay here. </s>
<s> do n't know why I had such horrible experience considering that it 's a four star hotel ; but I would n't come back here. </s>
<s> here for 3 nights for a Bridgestone 'Firestone convention. </s>

<s> was great with a beautiful view. </s>
<s> was very accommodating. </s>
<s> drinks and appetizers in main bar. </s>
<s> ! Great location. </s>

<s> significant other and I recently spent 3 nights at The James and on the last day I said ; " I wish we could stay longer " . </s>
<s> good ! The room was immaculate and a very pleasant surprise from the moment you open the door. </s>
<s> is high tech. </s>

<s> you wanted room service you got it from David Burke and the mini bar and liquor selection was plentiful. </s>
<s> even have a four legged friend menu. </s>
<s> bathroom was pleasant with bathrobes 'slippers and upscale products provided. </s>
<s> bed was the best in a hotel ever. </s>
<s> were crip ; white and fresh. </s>
<s> service twice daily with turn down service. </s>
<s> in room ; ice delivered ; iron ; hairdryer all top of the line. </s>

<s> best place we 've ever stayed not only in Chicago. </s>
<s> recommend. </s>
<s> recently returned from a trip to Chicago with my husband and baby and another couple and their baby. </s>
<s> the room at the hotel was quite nice we had a very negative experience with the front desk staff including managers. </s>
<s> we arrived it took over an hour to check in. </s>
<s> had requested two rooms on the same floor ; which the hotel staff had confirmed a number of times prior to our arrival. </s>
<s> we arrived they could not accommodate us and offered nothing to us to make up for it. </s>
<s> after we persisted they gave us half off for our room for one of the three nights we were there. </s>
<s> also asked the concierge to make us a reservation for brunch at a restaurant that would accommodate 4 adults and two babies in strollers. </s>
<s> we got to the restaurant they had only a reservation for 4 adults and had to make special arrangements to fit the babies in. </s>
<s> also had asked the hotel to make us an appointment for a personal shopper at Bloomingdales in order for us to save time shopping. </s>
<s> filled out forms in advance to direct the shopper and when we arrived for our appointment Bloomingdales advised us that they had only received the applications moments before and had not pulled together our requests. </s>
<s> complaining again to the manager at the hotel of these disappointments she advised that she would send something up to our room to compensate. </s>
<s> " something " never arrived. </s>
<s> will not be making a return visit to this hotel. </s>
<s> the housekeeping staff ; location and room were quite nice the over all experience was very negative. </s>
<s> with my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. </s>
<s> I looked at its web site I was convinced this was going to be the perfect place for my family and I to spend time in ; when not gazing the " sites " in Chicago. </s>
<s> was I wrong ; When I first arrived to check in there was no one insight at the desk. </s>
<s> ; after about 20 minutes ; I was approached with no apology for my wait. </s>
<s> trying to check in they told me there was a mixup and the room I originally requested was occupied ; I was given a less spacious room ; one bed for my wife and I to share with the kids ; and was told they would voucher my meals that day. </s>
<s> wife and I love sushi so we figured we use it on that. </s>
<s> we were done not only was the quality of the food mediocre but they told us the voucher would not work for the sushi bar. </s>
<s> display of customer service I have ever received and will never stay there again. </s>
<s> stayed in this hotel during a business trip ; and while conducting a business meeting in the hotel bar ; a customer grabbed all of the cash out of my wallet. </s>
<s> was informed ; but I was told that I had to wait to talk to them. </s>
<s> about twenty minutes of waiting I was informed that if I did not continue to wait l would never be able to report the incident ; despite the fact that I was a hotel guest. </s>
<s> I had to go to a business dinner and could no longer wait. </s>
<s> story short ; I no longer felt comfortable in this hotel and wish that someone ; anyone would have talked to me about it. </s>
<s> 've since been on the phone with a manager ; who promised to call me back once she researched the incident ; and have yet to hear back ; despite the promise that she would call me back two days ago. </s>
<s> expected more from this hotel. </s>
<s> needed to find a last minute hotel to stay in for the night so i came to this one. </s>
<s> of all the prices for one night are extremely high. </s>
<s> workers at the front desk were not kind at all and treated me like i was a second rate and not on their list of priorities. </s>
<s> i got into my room and got settled and it smelled of cigarettes and the air conditioner was making loud sounds so i didnt get much sleep. </s>
<s> the restroom was very dirty and frankly disgusting. </s>
<s> beds were very old and uncomfortable and the tv did not work at all. </s>
<s> i am very disappointed with this hotel. </s>
<s> at the InterContinental for an entire week on business and for the most part a very elegant ; convenient visit. </s>
<s> in the historic tower. </s>
<s> nice rooms ; great view ; attentive staff ; convenient location just north of the Tribune Tower the river ; and nice fitness club at $ 16 for the entire stay. </s>
<s> only downside is I could n't get over the feeling that I was being nickle dimed : $ 10 a day for Wi-Fi ; $ 6 bottles of water in the room ; $ 26 mini-bottle of wine in the fridge ; tipping multiple staff for carrying the same bags ; etc. </s>
<s> in-house restaurant Zest is Zagat rated though I 'm not sure why. </s>
<s> a 5 minute walk there are plenty of great restaurants with much better food than Zest. </s>
<s> ; next time I need to be near the Loop I 'd stay at the InterContinental again. </s>
<s> beds ; clean rooms ; amazing bathroom ; nifty view ; wonderful service ; expensive parking $ 40 ; but it 's Chicago ; speedy in and out. </s>
<s> European in sensibility and amenities ; but with air conditioning ! The Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel offered PDA or kiosk check-in which was great. </s>
<s> also offer hypo-allergenic rooms with air purification systems which gave us a much more delightful stay. </s>
<s> enjoyed the 24 '7 stay fit gym ; iHome stereo with iPod docking station ; flat screen tv with video on demand and Wi-Fi. </s>
<s> staff was very helpful with assisting us with finding excellent award winning dining and popular attractions in the area. </s>
<s> enjoyed our stay and will definetly return to this hotel in the future for family and business trips. </s>
<s> hotel ; our room overlooked Michigan Ave and we could see the river. </s>
<s> stylish ; trendy room and hotel. </s>
<s> a bit in amenities ' pool ; etc but more than made up for it with the location and quality of the hotel. </s>
<s> it thought Hotwire for $ 99 which was awesome value. </s>
<s> a recent business trip to Chicago ; I had the unfortunate circumstance of staying at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel. </s>
<s> entrance ; the lobby is beautiful and the hotel seems very nice. </s>
<s> ; as I approached the check in counter ; the woman working there was very terse and rude to me. </s>
<s> had me booked in the wrong kind of room and when I asked about changing it ; I was snubbed and made to feel like it was a tremendous imposition for them to accommodate me. </s>
<s> a half hour ; I finally received the correct room. </s>
<s> linens on the bed were of a very cheap quality ; they were scratchy and had a musty smell. </s>
<s> ; the bathroom was n't cleaned properly as there was still trash in the waste basket ' including a condom and there was no shampoo. </s>
<s> ; I had a coffee pot in the room but no coffee. </s>
<s> I called the front desk to ask for some ; they told be it was not free and would I like to charge the coffee to my account. </s>
<s> found this hotel to be shocking and highly recommend that no one stay there. </s>
<s> never write these reviews ; but felt that it was important to state that this hotel should not be the ' 1 2008 travelers choice. </s>
<s> Service ; Lazy Doormen 'bellmen 'concierge 'valet ; Lack of Respect ; allow dogs to bark all morning after multiple complaints ; Phantom charges to room ; front dest at checkout and checkin were pompus. </s>
<s> icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son ; and the doorman watched on doing nothing. </s>
<s> and my girlfriend are young ; look young in how we dress ; but in all honesty make more money than most . </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> and we were treated like cheap poor kids. </s>
<s> had dinner reservations at Spaiggia and wanted to order a car to pick us up ; the concierge exclaimed that ; " You know its not jeans and running shoes right Mr. </s>
<s> Blank ? " Assuming I was too dumb to realize that a 5 star $ 200 'person restraunt wont allow tennis shoes because I am young ? Very Dissapointed. </s>
<s> nice looking ; comfortable beds ; great room service ; contemporary ; younger crowd ; but service was terrible. </s>
<s> here for 4 nights in Apri. </s>
<s> check in the stay was perfect all round ; staff were so helpfuly and friendly especially Chris and Scott. </s>
<s> location could n't be better right on Michigan Avenue so easy access to everything. </s>
<s> was lovely and spacious and always clean and tidy at the end of the day. </s>

<s> husband and I visited the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park for our honeymoon. </s>
<s> customer service was amazing. </s>
<s> the time we booked our packege to the time we checked in everything was absolutely amazing. </s>
<s> people were proficient ; respectful and very thoughtful. </s>
<s> Fairmont had a lounge ; a wine room ; a bar and a restaurant. </s>
<s> could n't decide where I wanted to go first ! After we put our bags up we headed down to the wine room . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
It was totally delicious. </s>
<s> also got free wine just because it was our honeymoon ! Then after a few glasses of wine we hit the spa ; once again excellent ! Everything smells like honeysuckle and everyone smiles all the time. </s>
<s> stayed in the gold room. </s>
<s> it was a little bit smaller than I thought it would be I was definitely satisfied with the huge king bed with even bigger pillows. </s>
<s> husband and I relaxed in fluffy white bath robes while we sipped champagne while we watched the sparkling lights of the city. </s>
<s> was a wonderful experience that I will never forget. </s>
<s> thumbs up ! I recently stayed at the Amalfi Chicago with my wife on a business trip. </s>
<s> decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded. </s>
<s> enjoyed the luxurious in-room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city. </s>
<s> individualized attention from check-in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service. </s>
<s> Amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more. </s>
<s> weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site. </s>
<s> hotel 's design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses. </s>
<s> of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable. </s>
<s> is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt. </s>
<s> of European descent ; I enjoyed the croissants ; whole grain muffins ; real butter and marmalade. </s>
<s> also brought along our Standard Poodle ; Sterling ; and the Amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family. </s>
<s> purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed Sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings. </s>
<s> slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling " at home " while away. </s>
<s> pet lovers this is a big plus. </s>
<s> ; transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal. </s>
<s> allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this ; another appreciated bonus of our stay. </s>
<s> you Amalfi for a superb experience. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel was a delight to stay at. </s>
<s> 've never been to Chicago before ; but the location was fantastic. </s>

<s> location was so close to all the activities my husband and I had planned for our vacation. </s>
<s> have never been treated so much like royalty than at the Chicago Hyatt Regency. </s>
<s> Chicago - Stayed at the Conrad Chicago recently with my family. </s>
<s> real complaints about the hotel itself - room was a good size ; good decor ; nice and clean ' although when you 're paying over $ 250 a night ; you would n't expect anything less. </s>
<s> '
The staff ; however ; left a lot to be desired. </s>
<s> interactions with several staff members who should have been a lot more catering to our needs since they 're working in the service industry for such an upscale hotel. </s>
<s> example ; one morning ; the maid who serviced our room knocked on our door a little before we were getting ready to leave for the day. </s>
<s> told her we would be leaving soon and she could come back in 15 or so minutes. </s>
<s> to the Lincoln Park Zoo for the day. </s>
<s> several hours later ; and the maid was just starting to service our room ! We had to go and sit in the lobby for 20 minutes ; waiting for her to finish. </s>
<s> worst was when we voiced our complaints to the front desk ; they did n't seem concerned at all ; and basically ignored what we were saying. </s>
<s> time we 're in Chicago ; we 'll be trying a different hotel. </s>
<s> recently stayed in a room at the trendy Talbott Hotel. </s>
<s> looked nice on the outside so I decided to them a whirl. </s>
<s> soon as I walked in I noticed that there were n't alot of hotel employees. </s>
<s> ; the large hotel are swarming with service people ready to lend a hand. </s>
<s> was tired and I needed a nice room so as I approached the front desk I noticed something odd. </s>
<s> was sitting out right in front of the front desk. </s>
<s> were talking different items such as bagels and muffins from the left over breakfast rush. </s>
<s> everywhere especially where I was suppose to exchange cash and room keys. </s>
<s> 's just say it was n't professional. </s>
<s> room was average and the bathroom did n't carry the kinds of brands I would have liked to see. </s>
<s> Wi-Fi connection and I had to walk down the hall for ice. </s>
<s> about lack of customer service. </s>
<s> in all ; the stay was sub-par and nothing special. </s>
<s> stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers for three days while I was in Chicago on business. </s>
<s> was quite possibly the best hotel experience that I have ever had ; which says a lot considering the fact that I stay in hotels quite frequently. </s>
<s> staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating. </s>
<s> made sure that I had absolutely everything that I could want or need. </s>
<s> friendliness came across in a very genuine manner ; not fake or forced like some employees can be. </s>
<s> room itself was to die for. </s>
<s> bedding was so soft and the room was extremely clean and well kept. </s>
<s> can not speak highly enough about the quality of the mattress and bedding ! Because of the mattress and bedding ; I got the best three nights of sleep I 've ever had. </s>
<s> views of downtown Chicago were absolutely amazing from my room. </s>
<s> way the city lights sparkled stole my heart and almost made me want to move to Chicago. </s>
<s> food was amazing also. </s>
<s> made it a point to eat at all three of the hotel 's restaurants and visit the bar while I was there. </s>
<s> favorite restaurant of the three was Shula 's Steak House. </s>
<s> Chi Bar ; the hotel 's bar ; was amazingly designed and the drinks were great. </s>
<s> in all ; i would rate my experience a 5 out of 5. </s>
<s> is nowhere else in downtown Chicago that compares to the Sheraton. </s>
<s> Chicago - I stayed at the Conrad Chicago last month when I was in town for a business trip. </s>
<s> room was a good size ; and I loved the view of the city at night from my window. </s>
<s> it was really nice having the free internet access from my room - I get so annoyed when hotels charge you extra for it. </s>
<s> did n't have a chance to use the fitness center ; but I did walk by it ; and it seemed bigger than most hotels. </s>
<s> open 24 '7 which is nice. </s>
<s> ; do n't really have any complaints. </s>
<s> will consider staying here next time I 'm in Chicago ; especially if I can get a good deal ! took a weekend trip with my wife. </s>
<s> a great rate with valet included ; paid a couple extra bucks for the larger room. </s>
<s> was nice ; workout facility was great. </s>
<s> has current decor ; but was starting to show some wear. </s>
<s> watch the concierge ; she suggested a pretty bad restaurant to us. </s>
<s> friend highly recommended this hotel and we could n't have been happier ! It was wonderful my husband and kids were already planning our next trip there before we had even left the hotel. </s>
<s> kids loved the goldfish in the room and thought the window seats were the best. </s>
<s> speaking ; nothing bad about that place if there would not be the cleaning issue. </s>
<s> checked the closed with the mini bar ' picture uploaded ; so much dust ; nobody cleaned here for at least 3 years. </s>
<s> called in housekeeping ; giving them the opportunity to check and do something about it. </s>
<s> the same situation when returning to the room 4 hrs. </s>
<s> later. </s>
<s> day moved to a renovated room ; much better but not 5 star clean at all. </s>
<s> addition ; there was never a time when there was no waiting line at the reception ; no wonder when just 1 '3 of the counters is actually open. </s>
<s> do something about these issues its ruining everything ! Our stay at the Hilton Chicago was a pleasure from arrival to departure. </s>
<s> staff was super friendly and helpful ; the room was very clean and the location was fantastic. </s>
<s> walking track was an especially nice touch. </s>
<s> recommended ! Our room was on the third floor so there was some street noise - but it certainly did n't spoil our 4 nights in this lovely hotel. </s>
<s> tasting evening went down extremely well after a day seeing the sights of the city ! Our goldish was called Oliver - nobody could believe we had our very own goldfish in our room ! All the staff were really helpful and welcoming ; making our stay here very relaxing and comfortable. </s>
<s> certainly recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> there recently for one night for a conference. </s>
<s> to check-in at 5 : 30pm ' the published check-in was 3pm ; they said my room was n't ready ; where as others coming after me were assigned rooms. </s>
<s> given a dummy door key card and asked to chill in the lounge on the 32nd floor and that they would call on may cell as soon as the room was ready. </s>
<s> chilled there until 8pm ; no call ; so went out for dinner. </s>
<s> back at 9 : 30pm and asked if my room was ready. </s>
<s> gal said of course yes and give me a key. </s>
<s> asked why no one called me ; she just shrugged. </s>
<s> ; my troubles did not end there. </s>
<s> went to the room and opened the door only to find someone else in the room. </s>
<s> back to the lobby ; then they apologized and gave me another room. </s>
<s> said I was not going to walk-in on somebody else again ; so they sent someone with me to open the new room. </s>
<s> all my " trouble " they reduced my bill by about 40 %. </s>
<s> was definitely not worth the trouble they put me thru. </s>
<s> bad experience. </s>
<s> 've stayed at the Allegro a couple of times. </s>
<s> the other Kimpton properties ; it 's a classic old hotel that 's been beautifully updated. </s>
<s> found the staff to be cordial ; and I really like their corporate culture. </s>
<s> 're pet-friendly ' although I was n't travelling with the dog ; I got a recycling bin in my room ; Aveda products in the bath and they do n't clean with toxic chemicals. </s>
<s> rooms are n't huge and the bathrooms are n't what you 're going to get at a Hilton. </s>
<s> the Allegro lacks in square footage it more than makes up for in cool. </s>
<s> ; they may be a little pricey ; but I 'm willing to pay a bit more considering the higher cost of doing business responsibily. </s>
<s> hotel seems to take everything about luxury and force it down your throat. </s>
<s> first place it attacks you is directly inside of your pocket. </s>
<s> place looks alright in the lobby ; but when needing a place to stay during the midweek for a convention or to just sightseer in Chicago ; this is far too much to spend on a place to sleep for a night. </s>
<s> the Ambassador East Hotel has not taken into account that we are in a recession. </s>
<s> to mention that it is at least 30-40 minutes from the airport in traffic. </s>
<s> traffic is stressful enough without having to worry about how quickly the airport can be reached ; particularly if the front desk forgets to give you a wakeup call. </s>
<s> just spent the weekend here with my wife ; and she loved it as much as I do. </s>
<s> was here several weeks ago for a work trip booked by the company to show our staff off to some big clients ; so I did n't have any choice. </s>
<s> when my wife said she wanted to come to Chicago ; I knew this was the place to take her. </s>
<s> hotel has n't just been remodeled ; it 's been completely redesigned. </s>
<s> have been moved around to make the flow of the public spaces work better ; and the two rooms that I 've seen are showplaces. </s>
<s> are amazing. </s>
<s> hotel is part of a luxury chain ; and it 's easy to see why. </s>
<s> offer full room service at convenient hours. </s>
<s> 've been in every eating area now ; and they are all great ; too. </s>
<s> for business or pleasure ; you ca n't beat this. </s>
<s> 's a luxury hotel with all the luxurious features you 'd expect. </s>
<s> wife was stunned ; and yours will be ; too. </s>
<s> Chicago - It 's really a mess when I arrived at the hotel ; there 's only one receptionist dealing with 5 customers. </s>
<s> have to wait for 15 minutes to begin my check in. </s>
<s> room is clean and neat ; but a little small for its high price. </s>
<s> bathroom is uncleaned ; which is really annoying. </s>
<s> have to asked the room service to clean it after I arrived. </s>
<s> Hotel Chicago has several factors that make it one of the best hotels in the chicago area and an experience you will not forget in a long time. </s>
<s> proximity to some of the best spots in Chicago makes it a visitor 's delight. </s>
<s> is close to the Magnificient Mile which is the shopping area ; it is also close to the Loop ; Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue making it a fantastic location with great layout and it has lots of space. </s>
<s> guest room includes a flat screen HD TV. </s>
<s> beautiful reception has free snacks and drinks even as the hotel provides free breakfast. </s>
<s> 24-hour fitness centre is always open for business. </s>
<s> hotel has a no-smoking policy. </s>
<s> also has free internet facilities ; room service ; Air conditioning ; laundry 'drycleaning ; multilingual staff to make communication easy ; spa services ; heating ; conference facilities ; satelite tv ; brailed elevators and pets are allowed. </s>
<s> Concierge desk offer the best wine available and I must add that the wine is great. </s>
<s> hotel prides itself in making you feel like royalty. </s>
<s> staff are very pleasant and the door men are always willing to lend a hand. </s>
<s> hotel places priority on cleanliness as the rooms are always clean. </s>
<s> hotel makes it possible for you to relax ; go shopping in the best stores which are close-by ; eat in some of the best restaurants and party in clubs most of which they have entered into some form patnership. </s>
<s> offer great deals for every type of customer. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend this place. </s>
<s> Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is by far the best experience I have ever had away from home. </s>
<s> the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby ; you will never want to leave. </s>
<s> multiple ballrooms ; board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events. </s>
<s> you 're looking for leisure activities ; there are two bars ; the Lockwood Wine Cellar ; and an indoor pool. </s>
<s> staff is professional ; friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> service is excellent ; and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city. </s>
<s> hotel is the perfect location for downtown Chicago shopping. </s>
<s> only thing is the pool is extremely small - it is indoors ; but looks much larger on the website. </s>
<s> recently was in Chicago on business and chose to stay at the Swissotel ; Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel sells itself as being stylish ; sophisticated and luxurious and says it is in the center of the city. </s>
<s> would have been better off anywhere else. </s>
<s> was not impressed with the interior ; finding them bordering on clinical and too modern for my taste. </s>
<s> guess ' stylish might be modern in some people 's minds ; but not mine. </s>
<s> ; luxury to me means plush not hard and clinical. </s>
<s> I made my way to reception ; I hardly encountered the friendly customer service boasted of on the website. </s>
<s> had organized an executive suite as I was planning to work some of the time from my hotel room ; and thought the extra space would come in handy. </s>
<s> I proceeded to check in ; the girl at the desk told me ; while smacking gum ; that I had no reservation. </s>
<s> handed over my booking confirmation and she told me that at first she had spelled my name wrong ; even though I had spelled it out for her. </s>
<s> then proceeded to tell me that due to a conference ; all of the executive suites had already been allocated ; but that they would be happy to assign me to a lake view room. </s>
<s> me if I am wrong ; but this is a step down from the room I had asked for ! Surely if you give away my room ; you should try to compensate me with something better ! I said that no ; I really needed more space as I would be using the room as an office ; and finally she said that they did have a corner king room available ; and that if I wanted to switch the following evening ; I would be welcome to do that. </s>
<s> room was ok ; although ; again ; I was disappointed by how cold and clinical it felt. </s>
<s> did attempt to make use of some of the hotel services ; but found them sadly lacking. </s>
<s> comments on the services : the high speed wireless was not available in the room unless you were willing to pay a fee for a cable to connect ; and also a per day fee which borders on extortion ! There was free wifi in the lobby ; but requires you to sit near the doors which open constantly letting in freezing blasts of air ; plus deal with the noise and bustle of people constantly coming in and out. </s>
<s> did phone room service on my arrival to request an extra pillow and towels ; but had to wait 2 hours before they arrived. </s>
<s> fitness center and pool which I was looking forward to using ; were closed for cleaning when I went up. </s>
<s> the next morning consisted of continental items ; which is not what I would have expected for the money. </s>
<s> in all ; I would say your money is better spent elsewhere. </s>
<s> booked this hotel on Priceline for 4 '13 ; and a week later called the hotel directly to add 4 '12 to our stay. </s>
<s> receptionist confirmed my reservation confirmation and gave me a lower rate for both nights for the same king suite. </s>
<s> we arrived at check-in ; there was no record of my 4 '12 reservation whatsoever. </s>
<s> hotel was also fully booked ; leaving my tired ; hungry family and I high and dry with nowhere to go. </s>
<s> only decent thing that happened with this whole debacle was that Lisa at the check-in desk called around to several other hotels close-by to find us a room ; and seemed to be the only employee working at a very busy time of evening. </s>
<s> ended up at Embassy Suites for both nights and had a very pleasant experience there. </s>
<s> experiences at the Fairmont Chicago were less than desirable. </s>
<s> try to be fair when I write my reviews ; but fair is not in the Fairmont Chicago language. </s>
<s> pulling up to check in I felt the gouging start. </s>
<s> 54 a night for parking is terrible for this area $ 30-$ 35 is the average and that is not affordable as it is but $ 54 is just disgusting to put on your guests. </s>
<s> parking was more than my car rental. </s>
<s> the room the internet is not complementary it is $ 16 for standard and $ 25 for some sort of ultra upgraded internet service. </s>
<s> gouge gouge ; who charges for internet anymore and even worse upgraded services. </s>
<s> did n't go online every day of my 8 day stay because of the cost. </s>
<s> update on the internet that they do n't tell you upon check in is that if you sign up for the free premiere Fairmont club you will receive free in room internet service ; I found that out on the last day of my stay. </s>
<s> issues with this property is the shower pressure is not very good. </s>
<s> bed was hard and uncomfortable. </s>
<s> I would say there are many other properties that have a better location and price in the city. </s>
<s> a good note the Aria resturant in the Fairmont has a tremendous staff and serves up the best burger and fries I have ever had ; loved the complimentary naan and dips to start ; and the complimentary orange bark to finish. </s>
<s> my latest business trip ; both me and my wife recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in Chicago ; Illinois ; at one of their Deluxe suites. </s>
<s> ; and I think I speak for both of us ; we were not fully satisfied with the hotel. </s>
<s> hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations ; and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures ; the service is certainly sub-par. </s>
<s> one plans a stay at such an establishment ; they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in. </s>
<s> of all ; the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on ; the air coming out seemed musty. </s>
<s> of all ; the fitness center was only open until 10 : 30 pm. </s>
<s> people who like to exercise after dinner ; this can certainly be a problem. </s>
<s> considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight. </s>
<s> these ; as well as other similar reasons ; I would not recommend this hotel ; if one is looking for luxury accommodations. </s>
<s> others have said ; once all the construction works are completed I suspect that the prices this hotel can ' legitimately charge will put it out of our price range. </s>
<s> will be a pity because it is an excellent hotel ; the location could n't be better. </s>
<s> room was very spacious ; with separate sitting study areas a nice bathroom. </s>
<s> 3 minor points : downstairs they were serving a free basic breakfast ' coffee pastries ; but we only knew of it on our last morning - nobody had mentioned this ; the cost of internet - $ 9. </s>
<s> - is a bit dear especially when lots of motels now offer it free ; there was only powered milk in the rooms ; which was n't that nice. </s>
<s> none of these really spolied a really enjoyable stay. </s>
<s> a recent trip to Chicago to attend a major trade show I had the pleasure of staying with the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. </s>
<s> say stay with as that is how they make you feel ; from check in to check out they go above and beyond to ensure your stay is perfect and you want to return. </s>
<s> rooms are clean ; chic and roomy ; the beds - the best I have slept in ; bathrooms large and super clean. </s>
<s> can I say ; my new home when in Chicago . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
My experience with the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was Terrible ! I arrived exactly at my check in time only to be told my room would not be ready for another hour. </s>
<s> chose to wait patiently at the hotel bar and found myself again disappointed I sat for 15 minutes before the bar tender served me and the drink I received was warm. </s>
<s> the room was finally ready I was horrified to find hairs in the bathtub and mysterious spots on the bedding. </s>
<s> I called down to housekeeping the staff was very rude and maid who they sent up to change my sheets acted annoyed and muttered under her breath the whole time she was changing our sheets and cleaning the bathroom. </s>
<s> all this hassle I would normally expect at least a complimentary beverage but not only was that not offered I found even using internet at this location involved a rather exorbitant fee 13. </s>
<s> for a 24 hour period. </s>
<s> was shocked having stayed at a variety of higher end hotels I have never once been asked to pay extra for my wifi access. </s>
<s> I was highly disappointed with my stay and will not be returning to the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel any time soon. </s>
<s> away from the Hyatt Regency Chicago. </s>
<s> recently had to spend the weekend in Chicago on business ; and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town ; but alas ; I was left disappointed. </s>
<s> arrived in the afternoon ; my flight having been delayed ; ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening. </s>
<s> ; my room was not ready. </s>
<s> should have been ready hours earlier ; but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff. </s>
<s> any event ; I was advised to wait in the bar ; creatively named BIG Bar. </s>
<s> seemed annoyed that I wanted only water ; not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that I spent time in their hideously noisy establishment -- I wanted only to relax in my room. </s>
<s> waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk. </s>
<s> my room ready yet ? ' What room ? they replied. </s>
<s> my astonishment ; it seemed that I no longer had a reservation ! How this came to pass ; I do not know ; and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me. </s>
<s> explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned ; or furnished ; or renovated ; or whatever they were doing to make it ready ; but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer ; who spake " Guest Not Found " or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters. </s>
<s> requested the manager ; who was unavailable ; presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either. </s>
<s> ; I admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel ; with fewer regrets than I would have imagined ; to find a better place to spend the night -- a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point. </s>
<s> it was ; I found another hotel ; better priced ; better staffed ; and with rooms ready for my custom. </s>
<s> if you are looking an experience like no other ; book a room at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. </s>
<s> you want a place to sleep ; look elsewhere. </s>
<s> non-smoking room smelled very badly of stale cigarette smoke. </s>
<s> were not allowed to change rooms. </s>
<s> ; the concierge staff was unprofessional ; telling long winded personal stories to uninterested guests while long lines formed. </s>
<s> location was great. </s>
<s> is dated ; but would still be a nice place to stay if it were n't for customer service issues. </s>
<s> Chicago-The James is in a really convenient location ; just a couple blocks east of the Red Line and right by Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> having a room on the fourth floor by the elevators ; the noise was pretty minimal. </s>
<s> staff were really helpful and welcoming ; giving it a very good atmosphere. </s>
<s> a rate of $ 255 ; it was a very good value ; I would stay here again. </s>
<s> had reservations to check into the Chicago Conrad. </s>
<s> we arrived my wife and I were told the hotel was oversold and that I would have to take a double room rather than a king. </s>
<s> was a special weekend for my wife and I so this was a big disappointment. </s>
<s> were offered a free dinner which we accepted. </s>
<s> restaurant was dark and the food was fairly good. </s>
<s> tub in the bathroom was clogged with hair and we had to call maintenance to repair. </s>
<s> took about an hour to resolve. </s>
<s> we would not pick this hotel again. </s>
<s> should make sure all commitments are met and rooms are in excellent condition. </s>
<s> feel it was not a good value. </s>
<s> returned from 2 nights at the Ambassador and I have to say that I am very happy that I chose this hotel. </s>
<s> is true that this is an older hotel. </s>
<s> it is well kept and it does not lack in style and grandeur. </s>
<s> think of the hotel from the Shining ; minus the elevator of blood and creepy twins. </s>
<s> '
From the check-in desk to the surprise turn down service from the maids ; I was made to feel like royalty. </s>
<s> special acknowledgment goes out to the doormen who helped me with all my tourist questions. </s>
<s> the location of the hotel is great. </s>
<s> to all the action ; but on a quite residential street with beautiful old mansions. </s>
<s> also got a sweet $ 89 per night room by booking on travelzoo. </s>
<s> was just an added bonus however. </s>
<s> if I paid $ 200 per night ; my impression of the Ambassador would not change. </s>
<s> ; highly recommended. </s>
<s> is a great hotel ; in a great location ; in a great city ! There 's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part. </s>
<s> rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker 's in the bathroom . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
I had the Beatles and although they 're not my cup of tea ; I was happy enough with George staring back me ! The hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  try the " Cheesecake Factory " or have a meal cocktail on the top floor of the " John Hancock Centre " . </s>
<s> slighty longer walk ' or a short cab ride and you 're at the " Navy Pier " - take a ride on the " Seadog " then enjoy all the fun of the fair . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music. </s>
<s> hotel city is WELL worth checking out. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago is one of the most beautiful hotels that I have ever stayed at. </s>
<s> stayed there for 3 days and two nights. </s>
<s> room had an amazing view and was clean and furnished beautifully. </s>
<s> staff was very kind and very helpful. </s>
<s> concierge staff was kind and helped me to find enjoyable things to do in Chicago. </s>
<s> ; A beautiful hotel in a beautiful city. </s>
<s> Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel ; I had read some very good reviews of this hotel before I booked my stay ; so perhaps my expectations were too high. </s>
<s> I was quite disappointed and even a little ' creeped out by the guy they sent up for my in-room massage. </s>
<s> room seemed very small considering how much it cost and everything in it just seemed a little over-the-top ' overly ornate woodwork ; fussy furniture ; and garish paintings made it seem like they were trying too hard ; but not quite succeeding. </s>
<s> for the masseur ; there was nothing specifically wrong ; but he just came across as kind of inappropriate. </s>
<s> also claim to be in a great location in the heart of Chicago ; but my room did n't have any of the wonderful views of the skyline they show on their website ' however ; it did have lots of traffic noise. </s>
<s> do n't think I 'll be going back anytime soon. </s>
<s> stayed at the swissotel for our 25th anniversary. </s>
<s> got a corner room with both a lake and city view. </s>
<s> room was very clean and spacious. </s>
<s> staff was extremely friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> asked for late checkout ; and was told no problem. </s>
<s> you bring your car ; park in millinum parking it is just 2 blocks away. </s>
<s> cost there is $ 14. </s>
<s> compared to the swissotel which is $ 41. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> Talbott Hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges. </s>
<s> - not a bit worn - very much so I 'm sorry to say. </s>
<s> the location a block and a half from the best part of Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> ca n't be beat ; and the level of service is on par with many Four Seasons ; there were quite a few bumps in the road. </s>
<s> one ; the rooms are quite dreary - brown on brown is just so not pleasing. </s>
<s> desk chair was so badly worn that the " lift " button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no we 're not grossly obese. </s>
<s> back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable. </s>
<s> husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it - one to get him up to desk heighth ; one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk. </s>
<s> bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink ; so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door. </s>
<s> towels were very well worn and thin ; although bath sized ; which was a plus. </s>
<s> restaurant downstairs is practically another posting - suffice to say ; it was horrific. </s>
<s> had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables ; and they ' appetizers were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen. </s>
<s> room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side ; served on a large white plate ; and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic American cheese on a grocery store-like roll - very very sad. </s>
<s> the menu ; as limited as it was ; looked as though someone 's child had written it out. </s>
<s> good news is that Chicago is a fairly well-read restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go. </s>
<s> for us ; the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid $ 325 'nt for our disappointments. </s>
<s> good news is that the mini bars wares were incredibly well-priced - when 's the last time you had a $ 4 beer anywhere in a hotel ? ' even if it was Bud and Bud lite - lol ! The front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating. </s>
<s> water out of the shower was hot and plentiful ; and the bed comfortable. </s>
<s> A 'C was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever ; and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90 's our entire stay. </s>
<s> wi-fi - YES ! And it was n't horribly grindingly slow ! No need for the advertised " upgrade " for faster wi-fi. </s>
<s> - please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game. </s>
<s> there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased ; but we were sadly not. </s>
<s> always stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel Towers when we take our kids to the city. </s>
<s> ca n't beat the location which is in walking distance of Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> hotel is also just a couple of blocks from the fabulous Fox Obel ; a high end grocery store with many prepared items available to go and a great cafe that serves a stellar breakfast. </s>
<s> hotel staff are professional and courteous and the rooms are more than adequate with very comfy beds. </s>
<s> kids enjoy the pool with it 's windows that overlook the Chicago river. </s>
<s> is placed in downtown Chicago what makes it really loud ; it is hard to sleep during the night because all the " city " noises coming from the outside. </s>
<s> rooms in reality are also smaller than they look at at the pictures. </s>
<s> stayed in this hotel for weekend trip with my husband ; and we supposed to get room with king size bad ; but instead we got ; two single beds. </s>
<s> stuff is n't really very nice either ; they seems like they make you a favor just by talking to you. </s>
<s> gave the Conrad a second try at impressing me and it failed miserably. </s>
<s> hotel will not honor room requests. </s>
<s> expressed this was for a special occasion and would love a room with a view on my reservation. </s>
<s> got there and my ' view was of the adjacent office building windows. </s>
<s> did n't pay nearly $ 400 a night for that. </s>
<s> called down and the manager was absolutely rude. </s>
<s> That would 've required you to pay at least $ 40 more . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> " 
Rude. </s>
<s> and lots of mistakes happened. </s>
<s> pillows were never sent up ; the television sound was not functioning ' i. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> NO sound ; when telling the manager of the problems he was horribly condescending and cared very little. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
It had a nice ambiance to it. </s>
<s> bed was quite nice as well. </s>
<s> valet guys were fantastic ; probably the nicest men within that entire hotel. </s>

<s> the management team needs to go back to training school to learn about customer service. </s>
<s> at the Conrad restaurant is to be avoided completely. </s>
<s> service was abysmally inept ; and not to mention slow. </s>
<s> had two different watresses and it took upward of 15 minutes just to get our juice. </s>
<s> looked like they hated their jobs ; and treated us with the same attitude. </s>
<s> were never checked on after the food came. </s>
<s> food is overpriced and the quality is severely lacking. </s>
<s> got a continental breakfast and it included a muffin ' burnt ; a small croissant ; and a tiny cinnamon roll. </s>
<s> dollars for that. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> if you choose ; for 14 dollars you can get some toast and juice ! Spare yourself and choose to eat elsewhere where you can get an actual tasty meal for your money. </s>
<s> ; the managers need to learn what customer service means ; and how to bend over backwards for a customer. </s>
<s> your business will crumble. </s>
<s> the Conrad has crumbled for me. </s>
<s> spent way too much money on terrible service. </s>
<s> 've already sent my opinions to Hilton headquarters. </s>
<s> 'll be looking at other hotels the next time im in Chicago. </s>
<s> Chicago Millennium Park - Stayed for 2 days for business. </s>
<s> service ; great room. </s>
<s> wine bar in the lobby is a coffee bar in the morning ; which saved me from running around to find a Starbucks nearby. </s>
<s> found my room to be very large ; but I may just be used to tiny NYC hotel rooms. </s>
<s> addition to the standard desk ; bed ; bed stand and chair ; there was a table in the center of the room and a couch underneath the window ; and despite all of that furniture there was plenty of floor space. </s>
<s> only gripe was that there was n't much of a view - from the 16th floor ; if you sat on the couch by the window and looked out the corner you could see the lake ; but otherwise all I could see was the face of the building on the opposing street. </s>
<s> 've never written a review before ; but I just had to share my experience with Chicago 's InterContinental Hotel. </s>
<s> booked a weekend at this hotel for my wife 's birthday. </s>
<s> 've never stayed at a luxury hotel before and I thought this would be a great experience for us. </s>
<s> horrors started when we first got to the counter. </s>
<s> clerk mixed up our rooms and when I pointed this out he got really snooty with me. </s>
<s> get to our room and the maid had n't cleaned it yet ! We had to wait around for that ; so we went to the hotel 's restaurant and the food was terrible and overpriced. </s>
<s> our room is finished and the the " view " we were promised was non-existent. </s>
<s> top it off the maid did a terrible job cleaning. </s>
<s> toilet was dirty and we actually found a stain. </s>
<s> stain ! on the sheets. </s>
<s> a waste of money. </s>
<s> pointed this out the concierge and we were n't even offered a refund or discount. </s>
<s> again. </s>
<s> Conrad has all the right stuff - great bedding ; fancy decorations ; beautiful lobby ; etc. </s>
<s> ; they are seriously missing the boat when it comes to customer service and attention to detail. </s>
<s> I checked in ; I went to get a glass of wine from the minibar ; only to discover that everything in the fridge was warm. </s>
<s> called for help and was cheerfully told that they would send an engineer right away to fix it. </s>
<s> the meantime ; I said ; great ; but what about a cold drink ? They proceeded to send me 1 glass of wine via room service ; without asking me if this would be okay. </s>
<s> paid $ 25 for 1 glass of wine. </s>
<s> minibar bottle would 've given me 2 glasses for about $ 33. </s>
<s> was said to me about this obvious difference. </s>
<s> I called to complain ; I was made to feel cheap. </s>
<s> me ; it was not the money ; it was the principle. </s>
<s> next morning ; my bill showed that I had eaten something out of the minibar. </s>
<s> had not. </s>
<s> called ; and they said that the automatic sensors in the minibar must have triggered something ' duh - when the engineer came and took the entire fridge out of its compartment to fix it ; and they took the charge off. </s>
<s> also took $ 10 off my room service bill ; but I was still annoyed that nobody bothered to apologize or acknowledge the fact that I was overcharged. </s>
<s> ; when they fixed the minibar fridge ; they did not replace anything in it. </s>
<s> guy said ; it 'll take a while for things to cool down. </s>
<s> ; really ? How about the warm beer ; that was once cold ; that will now taste disgusting ? I guess they 're saving that for the next person who checks into my room and has no idea. </s>
<s> annoyance was that the lighted mirror in our bathroom did not work. </s>
<s> I plugged it in ; it made 2 other lights in the bathroom go off ; and then it never would come on. </s>
<s> seems that the Conrad thinks it can spend a lot of money to make itself look beautiful ; without worrying about each customer 's experience. </s>
<s> do n't think they go into the rooms and check them out. </s>
<s> their sta Booked a room online and got a great rate under $ 200 which is very cheap for a summer hotel room in Chicago in this nice location ; 3 blocks I think from the water. </s>
<s> though our rate was so cheap ; the service was wonderful ; the front desk were polite cheerful ; the doormen and valet were great and helpful ; and they even put a fridge in our room when we requested on ; free of charge ! The fitness room was clean ; large and provided fruit and clean towels ; and it had the greatest view of the city as it was on the top floor of the hotel. </s>
<s> of hotel is safe ; and such a beautiful area. </s>
<s> the rates directly online of the hotel 's website ; as it was the least expensive. </s>
<s> will stay here again for sure. </s>
<s> went to Chicago for my 2nd wedding anniversary and stayed at Homewood. </s>
<s> first impression was great ; very helpful valet employees and VERY nice. </s>
<s> is one perk of my stay here. </s>
<s> ; we had no problems checking in other than the hotel has 19 floors and when we booked the room we asked that we have the highest room avalible due to the fact that it was my husband first time there and the higher up ; the more beautiful the view is. </s>
<s> we got the 9th floor. </s>
<s> what I call " high up " when the rooms started on floor 6. </s>
<s> the following morning ; we went to breakfast of which was ok ; nothing great. </s>
<s> husband and I went down in jeans and a sweatshirt but had not really thought about shoes as we thought it would just be a few bagles ; some fruit ; and that was it. </s>
<s> ; we got our food and sat down. </s>
<s> getting stared at for the first 15-20 minutes ; an employee came and told us that we wernt allowed to eat breakfast without our shoes on. </s>
<s> you ; it was about 15-20 minutes after we had even entered the room. </s>
<s> she asked that we go get shoes while sitting down and eating our breakfast. </s>
<s> pointless AFTER we already had gotten our food. </s>
<s> am sure it is because very few employees could speak understandable english that it took so long. </s>
<s> but not least ; dont come with a clean car. </s>
<s> had washed my car one day prior to arriving there and when it was returned ; it was filthy dirty. </s>
<s> had the misfortune of being booked at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago a few weeks ago. </s>
<s> a joke. </s>
<s> start off ; the housekeeping staff must be on strike or they are very understaffed. </s>
<s> do n't know who made the bed up in my room ; but it could have been done better by my 7 year old. </s>
<s> the bathroom. </s>
<s> spots ; soap scum and ' ugh hair of ALL kinds in the sink ; tub and about the floor. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> requested non-smoking ; either they did n't listen or did n't care ; but my room and the linens smelled like an old ashtray. </s>
<s> " beautiful view " was ruined by water spots - not outside 'which is forgiveable but INSIDE ! And they were sticky. </s>

<s> arrived at the Talbot Hotel where we had reserved the American Doll Girl package only to find out that they had given our room away and that they were going to move us across town. </s>
<s> that was n't bad enough we had to spend an hour to find out if the American Girl carriage ride had been canceled or if we should book another one. </s>
<s> daughter sulked for most of the trip as we spent more time going from thing to thing instead of being able to walk. </s>
<s> daughter cried herself to sleep the first night and I could tell that her heart was broken. </s>
<s> Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is great alternative to ordinary hotels. </s>
<s> hotel is decorated with a huge variety of music memorabilia that makes the stay worth it alone. </s>
<s> hotel is often visited by many talented artists including singers ; dancers ; actors etc. </s>
<s> staff were very polite and helpful and always pleasant. </s>
<s> rooms were very clean and nicely decorated ; as were the common areas and hallways. </s>
<s> would highly recommend the hotel to anyone staying in the area. </s>
<s> just returned from our first trip to Chicago and stayed at the Omni. </s>
<s> read many reviews on trip advisor and picked the Omni based on its wonderful reviews and they were right on. </s>
<s> location ; staff ; rooms ; amenities ; etc were all wonderful. </s>
<s> thank you to TA members who suggested signing up for the preferred member program. </s>
<s> did that before we left and received complimentary beverages in the morning and newspapers among other perks. </s>
<s> loved being woken up to fresh orange juice and the Chicago Tribune newspaper. </s>
<s> were in room 816 which was perfect. </s>
<s> suite with two out of the 3 sides of the rooms being windows with a great view. </s>
<s> room was huge with a gorgeous king bed and great living area with plasma TV. </s>
<s> bathroom amenities were wonderful. </s>
<s> loved soaking in the tub with the mineral salts that were provided. </s>
<s> turn down service was great as well. </s>
<s> would come back to our room with relaxing music playing and our bed ready for us. </s>
<s> ate at their restaurant twice and the breakfast buffet was delicious. </s>
<s> blueberry muffins were the best I have ever had. </s>
<s> was so fresh and prepared perfectly. </s>
<s> staff at the Omni is so accomodating. </s>
<s> is always smiling and asking you how your stay is. </s>
<s> to thank the concierge Melissa and Curtis. </s>
<s> were both so helpful with great dining suggestions and maps for everything we wanted to do. </s>
<s> also used the gym during my stay and it was great. </s>
<s> the machines were top notch and each treadmill has a lcd TV attached. </s>

<s> am a stickler for cleanliness and it was sparkling every morning. </s>
<s> really was a fantastic stay at the Omni and we would never stay anywhere else. </s>
<s> also wanted to mention we never heard any construction while we were there. </s>
<s> was quiet and we both slept wonderfully on the big comfy bed. </s>
<s> you Trip Advisor for another great trip suggestion ! Me ; My sister and my best friend all went to stay here in the summer of 2004 . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> they said there all spacious suites . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> yeah right . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> our room you could barely walk in . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and they said theres 2 double beds . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> yeah well one was a pull out couch . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and the bathroom . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> tiny tiny tiny . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and it took forever and a day to check in and the people blamed us for throwing a book out the window and somehow someone knew exactly where it fell from and which room . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> yeah . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i wouldnt stay here again Beautiful hotel ; but does n't have a lot to offer for the price. </s>
<s> and pillowcases in the room had stains on them ; TV remote would not function properly. </s>
<s> service truly needs improvement. </s>
<s> payed quite a bit for overnight parking ; and it took them almost an hour to bring our car to us when we needed to leave. </s>
<s> we asked to find out what was taking so long ; we got tossed back and forth between bell hop and front desk ; with no answers. </s>
<s> historic feel of the hotel really had a strong influence on my choice to book this hotel. </s>
<s> ; the ambiance of the hotel could not make up for the rest of its shortcomings. </s>
<s> front desk staff was rude ; the doormen were usually busy chatting or playing on their cell phones instead of greeting us or opening the door. </s>
<s> are three elevators but good luck with them all working. </s>
<s> are very very small and when only one is up and running . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> you end up waiting a long time for one. </s>
<s> fun when you are on the 12th floor. </s>
<s> room was TINY and the air conditioning did not work at all . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the room felt damp and miserable. </s>
<s> put the thermostat as low as it would let us ' 65 and the room never went below 78. </s>
<s> and it was 107 outside the whole trip !. </s>
<s> really are no amenities inside the hotel other than an ice machine and a slightly overpriced restaurant. </s>
<s> is not free either . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
Overall ; I would never stay here again. </s>
<s> was sorely disappointed with the Sheraton Chicago. </s>
<s> the outside it looks like a great hotel ; and I guess the inside was clean enough but the decor was really boring and frumpy ; not what I expected when looked at the website. </s>
<s> front desk staff was nice enough at first ; but when I asked for the wifi password they told me I had to pay extra. </s>
<s> mean come on ; I 'm paying over 200 bucks a night and wifi is EXTRA ? The lady who checked us in got a little snippy about it and said it says so when you make the reservation. </s>
<s> Note to self ; do n't let your husband book a hotel without checking first about what amenities are offeredd. </s>
<s> '
So things started off on the wrong foot anyhow. </s>
<s> guess the positives for this hotel are the location and the lakeview ' from some of the rooms and it seems pretty safe. </s>
<s> than that I was not impressed for the price - I 've stayed in big city hotels for half the price that had better linens ; a better restaurant ; where they got your room cleaned up at a reasonable hour ' we stayed two nights and we did n't get our beds made and fresh towels until almost 5. </s>
<s> guess the most unpleasant thing was the odd smell - not musty per se but maybe like chemicals they use to cover up a mildewy smell. </s>
<s> general it seems lke it 's on the decline and the staff knows it ; they 're just kind of lackadaisical. </s>
<s> would n't stay there again. </s>
<s> stayed here for a weekend trip to Chicago and we will come back and stay here again. </s>
<s> was great place front desk clerks were very helpful. </s>
<s> we loved the view. </s>
<s> nice quiet place and upto date and super clean. </s>
<s> will def stay here again highly recommended. </s>
<s> simply the Hyatt Regency Chicago is the business traveler 's best friend. </s>
<s> I had to attend a seminar in Chicago and stayed at the Hyatt. </s>
<s> say I was impressed would be an understatement. </s>
<s> located in the heart of downtown ; the Hyatt has perfected the art of ultimate guest satisfaction. </s>
<s> arrival the staff goes into overdrive. </s>
<s> make you feel like you are the only guest in this huge hotel. </s>
<s> rooms are very big and elegantly furnished with 100 percent cotton linens. </s>
<s> room came equipped with flat screen tv ; wi-fi and high speed internet. </s>
<s> service was quite extensive and if it was not on the menu they went out of their way to accomodate you. </s>
<s> were also car rental on site as were restaurants ; cocktail bar and a 24 hour dining room. </s>
<s> have state of the art conference rooms with high tech features. </s>
<s> is also catering and limo service. </s>
<s> staff is multilingual and the concierge service is very professional. </s>
<s> in all they will pamper you from head to toe and other parts in between. </s>
<s> hotel is definitely worth the price and I will definitely return not as a business traveler but as a tourist who wants to be pampered. </s>
<s> only regret ? That I could not stay much longer. </s>

<s> Palmer House - I stayed at the Palmer House while traveling to Chicago to meet some old friends. </s>
<s> I arrived to Chicago O 'Hare at 1 a. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> after being delayed twice due to weather ; but rather than having to take a cab ; a shuttle bus was immediately available to take me to the hotel. </s>
<s> arrival I had another difficulty surrounding the double booking of my room. </s>
<s> at 2 a. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> at the front desk was able to help me with a smile as she upgraded my room for free. </s>
<s> these two problems had been dealt with the rest of my stay in Chicago was delightful. </s>
<s> that some of the images on the website make the rooms appear much larger than they really are ; but my room was very comfortable regardless. </s>
<s> Palmer House served my needs perfectly ; and I anticipate staying there again next year when I come back. </s>

<s> friends actually received the goldfish upon request ; which they enjoyed. </s>
<s> noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above ; but it was minimal. </s>
<s> seemed very resonable to us for the location. </s>
<s> certainly return to the Windy City and plan on staying here again. </s>
<s> hotel was full of drunks. </s>
<s> lobby was full of crowds at night and the bar was way too busy. </s>
<s> were people stumbling all over the hotel at all hours of the night ; yelling in the hallways ; making lots of noise. </s>
<s> staff had little to say. </s>
<s> was n't aware of the noise level when I booked the room and when I threatened to make other reservations ; the people in the lobby had nothing to say. </s>
<s> asked for a water view and got a city view. </s>
<s> ; the people at the front desk were n't accomodating at all. </s>
<s> ; we had a horrible experience. </s>
<s> loved the hotel. </s>
<s> I see other posts about it being shabby I ca n't for the life of me figure out what they are talking about. </s>
<s> were large with TWO bathrooms ; lobby was fabulous ; pool was large with two hot tubs and huge gym ; staff was courteous. </s>
<s> us ; the location was great -- across the street from Grant Park with a great view of Buckingham Fountain and close to all the museums and theatres. </s>
<s> 'm sure others would rather be north of the river closer to the Magnificent Mile but we enjoyed the quieter and more scenic location. </s>
<s> it for $ 105 on Hotwire. </s>
<s> a bargain for such a nice hotel. </s>

<s> lobby is immaculate and is filled with reams of class and style. </s>
<s> rooms are beautifully adorned. </s>

<s> called to complain and they assured me that someone would be in my room to fix the shower or show me how to use it. </s>

<s> waiting 30 minutes a bell hop came up to show me how to use the shower. </s>
<s> was not a service person. </s>
<s> could not get the shower to work either and apologized for the problem I was having. </s>
<s> expected a tip and complained when I did not give him one. </s>
<s> came up after that. </s>
<s> was told I could switch to a different room ; so I had to pack up my belongings and move to another floor. </s>
<s> shower did work in this other room ; but I did n't have the view of the city that I had in the first room. </s>
<s> was looking at a brick wall. </s>
<s> there was a party in the next room that was so loud it kept me up all night. </s>
<s> complained and the hotel staff told me they were VIPs and could not do anything about the noise. </s>
<s> hotel was overpriced and my stay was miserable. </s>
<s> not go to the Omni Hotel. </s>
<s> 've stayed in $ 50 a night motels with better service. </s>
<s> - Our stay at the Fairmont Hotel was wonderful. </s>

<s> got a great room on the 8th floor and it was clean ; well-maintained and spacious. </s>
<s> best part of our stay were the very comfortable King size beds. </s>
<s> had a great sushi bar and a first-rate gym that was large and well equipped. </s>
<s> the 2nd day of our stay ; they even provided us with complimentary massages at the spa. </s>
<s> had such high hopes when I booked a stay at the Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago a few short weeks ago. </s>
<s> I arrived I should have known things would not be as I expected them to be. </s>
<s> host at the desk was rude and seemed put out that I was there. </s>
<s> I finally got checked in and arrived in my room I found that the temperature in the room was far too hot. </s>
<s> air conditioner was not turned on and on a hot ; muggy day it would have been nice to enter into a cool room. </s>
<s> turned on the air conditioner and after quite some time the room cooled down. </s>
<s> I arrived in the early afternoon I decided to order room service from the Nix Restaurant that is in the hotel ; I ordered the Gooey Triple Decker Grilled Cheese ; at $ 14 I was expecting the best grilled cheese sandwich I had ever eaten. </s>
<s> it finally arrived ; more than an hour later ; it was cold and the cheese was far from gooey ! It also comes with a bowl of Tomato Bisque soup which ; needless to say was also cold. </s>
<s> the quality of the food ; $ 14 was way too much to pay for this meal. </s>
<s> a meeting with clients we stopped by the Martini Bar for drinks. </s>

<s> we got our drinks ; we all ordered a French Martini. </s>
<s> all took a drink and immediately all our mouths puckered ; it had far too much pineapple juice in it making it very ; very tart. </s>
<s> $ 14 each you would think it would be made to perfection ; far from it. </s>
<s> evening finally over I went back to my room where I now found the temperature to be too cold due to the air conditioner not turning itself off when it should have. </s>
<s> a miserable night I checked out glad to be done with the Knickerbocker Hotel ! The best service ! The staff here was incredible. </s>
<s> never had to lift a finger. </s>

<s> intercontinentalchicago - This hotel was spectacularly revolting. </s>
<s> the ghastly lobby decorating ; to the loathsome hotel staff ; I had a harrowing experience the entire time. </s>
<s> yourself a favor and be sure to not try the self declared wonderful hotel food. </s>
<s> the belgian waffles ; otherwise you might have to spend the night like I did on the admittedly large bathroom floor. </s>
<s> good thing about the hotel is the location ; the front entrance puts you right on the magnificent mile ; and close to all of the museums and the aquarium and whatever else you might want to see while you 're in town. </s>
<s> you can save yourself some money and agony by staying at another much nicer hotel for a far more reasonable price and still see the same attractions. </s>
<s> booked my room at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers somewhat reluctantly ; I was not enthusiastic about spending over $ 200 on this room after seeing the lackluster photos on their website. </s>

<s> ; my hopes were dashed once again when I arrived at my room. </s>
<s> say ' at because after discovering my newly issued key was not working ; I had to wait ten minutes before someone finally came to let me in. </s>

<s> disappointment continued after I entered the bathroom and found that it not only reeked of smoke ; but also outfitted with the cheapest trimmings possible. </s>
<s> stayed my two nights ; and was surprised to find out that all sorts of other charges were added to my room ' for which I was not responsible ; charged on demand movies ; an empty mini bar ; AND for smoking in the bathroom. </s>

Unacceptable ! My $ 1500 laptop and all of the things I brought with me were in that room ! Not my mistake ! FINALLY ; after arguing with the head of security for about 30 minutes ; they knocked on the door of the room I had left my belongings in and a lady answered. </s>

This might be a classy looking hotel in downtown Chicago ; and while the location is not bad ; the rooms are definitely hit or miss. </s>
<s> range from the super basic " affordable " room to the presidential and huge suites that only presidents could probably even afford. </s>
<s> so many different room options ; it 's no wonder they have difficulty honoring your exact reservation if you check-in past 4 : 00 pm. </s>
<s> hotel has a decent pool ; but the health club is extra per day ; as are many other services at the hotel. </s>
<s> 'd imagine that for the price of a stay here $ 160 up to multiple hundreds that more things would be included ! Additionally ; the check-in staff was a bit snobby and unhelpful. </s>

<s> Shoddy construction of room fixtures : ceiling light was missing leaving a fist-sized hole with wires exposed ; BOTH towel racks fell off the wall without being touched ; and bathroom door often came off it 's sliding mechanism with gentle use. </s>
<s> When we reported these problems ; employees simply put the towel racks back on the wall without properly adhering them to the wall. </s>
<s> Upon check-out ; they did not have record of my in-laws paying for our stay ; though it was noted on our reservation that they had made it for us. </s>
<s> had to pay for our $ 300 gift and the in-laws were extremely upset. </s>
<s> we wrote a letter to management ' as a manager was not available to speak with us when we left we did not receive an adequate apology. </s>

<s> would wake up with body aches and headaches. </s>
<s> wife even said she lost feeling in her arms some nights. </s>
<s> good. </s>
<s> ; the internet in the room is hard to set-up ; slow to use ; and inconsistent. </s>
<s> generally had to restart my computer at least once to get the internet to work. </s>

<s> 's not really worth it. </s>
<s> SERVICE Room service was very inconsistent and nonsensical. </s>
<s> mornings they would take our towels ' even the ones we hung up to use again and not replace them ; other times they would replace some towels and not others. </s>
<s> would also come at vastly different times. </s>
<s> SERVICE This hotel LOVES to nickel and dime. </s>

<s> was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying $ 25. </s>
<s> HOTEL The hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower. </s>
<s> west tower has some underground amenities no one uses. </s>
<s> bars are extremely expensive ; but the drinks are tasty. </s>
<s> food is edible too ; but I would n't brag about it. </s>
<s> hotel is not directly on the main street ' Michigan ; but it 's not too far from it. </s>

<s> location is in walking distance of the theatres ; parks ; the river ' take a cruise ; Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> 's ideal. </s>

<s> a self-sufficient traveler ; you would n't really need their services ' although it is nice but for someone coming to Chicago for the first time ; a concierge can be very helpful. </s>

<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago is the only place we will stay when we return to the Windy City ! I am not much of a complainer ; as you can see when reviewing my other posts on this site ; but the Talbott provided such bad service that I feel the need to warn future travelers to Chicago : My girlfriend and I stayed at the Talbott for 2 nights in late July 2006. </s>
<s> first sign that something was wrong come during the initial booking of the room over the phone. </s>
<s> receptionist was outright rude ; but took the reservation without a mistake. </s>
<s> our stay the hotel and restaurant staff was extraordinary incompetent ; the waiters ; the managers ; nobody was friendly ; nor tied to accommodate us. </s>
<s> We and many others who stayed at the hotel attended a wedding reception close by and had arranged the hotel bar to remain open from 12-2 to have an after hour 's party. </s>

<s> we returned from the reception at 11 : 50pm the bar was closing and the night manager and hotel staff were very rude to me and my friends. </s>

<s> Conrad Hilton recently took over this property from the failed Meridian Hotel. </s>
<s> seems that the Conrad has inherited a hotel property that just does n't work. </s>
<s> entrance is very difficult to find. </s>
<s> are only two elevators to take you up to the lobby. </s>
<s> a result ; there was often a line waiting for them. </s>
<s> same problem affects the guest room elevators located beyond the registration area. </s>
<s> you go in and out of the hotel more than a couple of times during your stay ; you will find the poor elevator layout annoying. </s>
<s> King room is what I would consider small compared to other Chicago hotels. </s>

<s> arrived at the hotel to check-in at 5 : 00 on that Friday afternoon. </s>
<s> making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room would n't be available for another hour. </s>

<s> we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the doll-sized travel bed that is included in the package was n't in the room. </s>
<s> disappointed my daughter ; she was looking forward to that. </s>

<s> rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly. </s>
<s> managed to have a good time together even though the service was n't quite what is claimed on the website. </s>
<s> I go to the Talbott Hotel again ? Probably not. </s>
<s> a great deal through Hotwire for $ 70 a night but if I ever return to Chicago I would definitely stay again ; even at full price. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> it does n't take much ; I know !. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> the lack of memorabilia did n't bother me but I was more interested in the art deco features of the building itself anyway. </s>
<s> only fault was that the speakers in the room were crackling a bit oh ; and my boyfriend thinks he was propositioned by a " friendly lady looking for business " when he was at the bar. </s>
<s> think it 's a place you will either love or hate ; if you like laid back ; contemporary hotels without the intimidating factor then this is the place for you ! I stayed at Swissotel Chicago when I was on business and it was very nice. </s>

<s> would stay again in a heart beat ! I just got back from theTalbott hotel in Chicago ! I was very pleasantly surprised. </s>

<s> the price was okay ; I personally would have preferred staying at the Westin or some other hotel that is very modern and more accomodating to business travelers. </s>
<s> in Chicago only for the weekend ; I would rather have enjoyed a much larger room ' the rooms were so tiny ; and more modern amenities ' the tiny bathroom was under-equipped. </s>
<s> ; the walls are paper thin ; I could hear pretty much everything going on in the rooms around me. </s>
<s> tea and wine for free at certain times was nice ; but overall I would say that ; for the price ; I would definitely not recommend this Hotel. </s>
<s> stayed at the Allegro in July for 4 nights for a business trip. </s>
<s> room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great. </s>
<s> had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny ; but ours was perfectly fine ; with funky ; fun doors. </s>

<s> arrived late and maybe that 's when they put out their second-stringers ; but we felt unwelcome by the desk staff -- like we were an intrusion. </s>
<s> 'll never understand this -- they 're in the hospitality business and they 're inhospitable ! ' This is getting picky ; but the reception desk which is cleverly designed to look like a vintage Louis Vuitton trunk needs some maintenance. </s>
<s> repeated " HM " initials are peeling off -- looks like they used rub-downs where they should have silk screened for durability. </s>

<s> were no ashes -- so I 've ruled out spontaneous combustion. </s>

<s> on Kimpton ! How much can a decent roll cost ? The view towards the river is great ' try to get one and my daughter loved the upholstered wide ledge by the window -- she closed the curtains and was in her own " club house " watching the world go by from from high above the city. </s>
<s> short : very nice hotel -- desk staff at night could be nicer ' would n't cost anything and would have made up for the maid 's shoes ! The Talbott Hotel is fantastic ! I stayed there on business and found that it met my every need. </s>
<s> high speed internet access worked flawlessly ; allowed me to do much of my work from the comfort of my luxuriously appointed room. </s>
<s> really like to exercise before a day of meetings ; access to the fitness club next door was very convenient. </s>

<s>  </s>

<s> free luxury ! After staying for a week in Chicago ; my thoughts : The value at this hotel is . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  ok. </s>
<s> 's probably the best you 'll find in Chicago ; though ; but this is Chicago. </s>
<s> ; $ 200 'night was n't so bad and definitely better value than anything else in the area. </s>
<s> staff is at least a couple of notches above the competition ; everyone I encountered was friendly and responsive. </s>
<s> ; surprisingly for a hotel ; their breakfast was actually edible. </s>
<s> final note : the bathrooms at this hotel are ridiculous - I could probably live in one and not even need the actual room. </s>
<s> Chicago - I stayed at Hilton Chicago for two nights in April and was not quite impressed. </s>
<s> good thing about the hotel is that it has a great view since it is located by the Michigan Lake but I do n't have much comment on that since the lake view rooms were already out when I checked in. </s>
<s> room that I stayed was quite spacious but the decorations and layout was not up to the general Hilton standard. </s>
<s> the size of the bathroom was on the small side compared to other hotels in Chicago on the same level. </s>
<s> location of the hotel is good for people who wants to tour the city given that the Auditorium Museum ; an aquarium and some other fun spots are in walking distance. </s>
<s> the dining is a problem here. </s>
<s> grill bar and cafe in the hotel much overpriced and the choice were limited. </s>
<s> also was n't able to find nice restaurants on yelp close to the hotel so I ended up having my dinner in a distance quite far. </s>
<s> ; it 's a decent hotel but not what I expected for a Hilton standard. </s>
<s> wife and I stayed at the Affinia Chicago last week ' in a studio suite ; which was NOT worth the extra payment. </s>
<s> was an absolute NIGHTMARE ! To begin with ; the room is listed as ' oversized ; when it 's nothing of the sort. </s>
<s> 've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller. </s>
<s> believe the only extra space was in the closet ; which is n't very useful unless you plan on living there ! We had our two sons with us ; so we had to make extra sleeping space. </s>
<s> oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time ; complaining of bugs moving around. </s>
<s> must have been umcomfortable also ; as I sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock. </s>
<s> room service is horrible ; they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm ; and she had to wait up for that. </s>
<s> family would NEVER go back to this hotel ; and I highly recommend you also stay well away. </s>
<s> Chicago Hotel Our stay here was just ok. </s>
<s> particularly wrong with it ; but nothing worth paying the extra money for either. </s>
<s> 'll admit that the rooms were nice - large and with a ton of stuff in them ; but my wife and I do n't really need a full dining table. </s>
<s> main complaint is how they nickel-and-dime you. </s>
<s> expensive as a room is per night ; $ 55 for parking ' daily ! is excessive. </s>
<s> listed them as pet friendly ; but when they saw my wife 's beagle they tacked on another $ 50 or so charge. </s>
<s> is free in the lobby ; so that 's nice at least ; but to get it in your room you have to pay for it. </s>
<s> an already expensive hotel ; these types of charges did not make my stay any more enjoyable. </s>
<s> time I 'll take a better look at surrounding hotels before booking. </s>
<s> booking a room over two months in advance at the Hotel Sofitel Chicago Watertower and confirming my reservation twice ; I arrived to find that the front desk staff had ' no record of my reservation and that the only rooms available were much more expensive than the room that I had reserved. </s>
<s> I asked to speak to a manager ; it took almost half an hour for him to turn up. </s>
<s> did finally give me a room at the rate that I had been promised ; but did not offer any compensatory discount or bonuses for my inconvenience. </s>
<s> room itself smelled of dog but was otherwise okay. </s>
<s> worth the rate though. </s>
<s> website really makes this hotel seem upscale ; clean ; and well decorated ; but the rooms are not in the style that you would expect from the lobby. </s>
<s> staff 's response to my request to move to another room because of the obvious dog smell ' which could only mean it had n't been cleaned properly was met with contempt. </s>
<s> did move me ; but I did not get an apology. </s>
<s> not stay again. </s>
<s> Monaco is in a really great location ; only a block away from the Miracle mile and a couple of blocks from Millenium Park. </s>
<s> Tower is also well within walking distance and if you do n't mind walking you wo n't have a problem walking to Greek Town and Lincoln Park ' we did. </s>
<s> daily ; complimentary ; wine hour is a really nice touch that we unfortunately were only around once to try out. </s>
<s> you can ; leave your car behind ; you wo n't need it and the parking is quite pricey ; which is not very surprising considering the location. </s>
<s> was clean ; fresh and modern and the staff very helpful. </s>
<s> only bad thing was that the noise from the elevated train around " the loop " was quite loud and that our room happened to be next to the maid 's supply room so it was quite busy in the morning. </s>
<s> stayed at the Hard Rock on January 27th ; 2009 for $ 125 'night. </s>
<s> is located on Michigan Ave ; just two blocks from the Mag Mile ; two blocks from Millenium Park ; and five blocks from the Chicago Art Institute. </s>
<s> hotel room was very nice with views of Michigan Ave and a unusually comfy bed. </s>
<s> hotel even offered free coffee in the lobby every morning and free wifi in the rooms. </s>
<s> was $ 45 for valet and $ 30 for self parking. </s>
<s> staff was very helpful with all of our request. </s>
<s> a nice place to stay . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
I had a great deal for the room ; and was impressed with the quality. </s>
<s> staff was very helpful ; they were able to let me check out and helped me print boarding passes. </s>
<s> : It is frustrating that nowadays you do not have free internet in most hotels and it 's the same here ; you have to pay for the internet. </s>
<s> : Loud on the phone you may hear your neighbors on the phone ; or them shower. </s>
<s> staff at the Talbott hotel was completely unresponsive when I told them there were a bunch of drunken teenagers playing ding ; dong ; ditch. </s>
<s> sheets smelled funny when I arrived and were only changed 6 times during my two-week stay. </s>
<s> room service was very slow and the cleaning crew did not replace my soap ; but I did notice the contents of the mini-bar diminished every time the maid service had been in my room. </s>
<s> Rock Hotel Chicago - This hotel is awesome ! The rooms are truly beautiful ; mine had huge windows with a breathtaking view of the Chicago skyline. </s>
<s> out the window in the morning as the sun rose over the city was one of the highlights of the whole trip. </s>
<s> bed was quite large ; maybe a little too large for my tastes since I was travelling alone. </s>
<s> a couple I think it would be perfect. </s>
<s> are also some large nightstands on either side of the bed that are very convenient for putting the contents of your pockets on ; and they have a built-in ipod charger which was incredibly convenient for me. </s>
<s> one major downside to the room was the placement of the bathroom. </s>
<s> door is too close to the head of the bed. </s>
<s> since I was travelling alone it was n't a huge problem ; but if my wife were with me ; someone would have gotten blinded by the light from the bathroom during the night. </s>
<s> a fairly minor complaint given how excellent my stay was in general. </s>
<s> a very nice location close to shopping and places to eat and also in a beautiful neighborhood. </s>
<s> small hotel with a pleasant place to sit in the lobby ; the Pump Room is a classic place to have a drink. </s>
<s> did not have dinner there so I can not comment but we enjoyed people watching while we had an afternoon drink looking out the window at the people in the neighborhood. </s>
<s> is a short walk to very good shopping and eating. </s>
<s> lovely hotel in a trendy part of Chicago which gives it a much more comfortable feel than the downtown hotels. </s>
<s> rooms are very ; very well appointed ; but not large ; and the quality of the materials is wonderful without exception. </s>
<s> ; the service was below average in every way : they failed to deliver laundry by an important and assured deadline ; valets did n't deliver the car and had to be asked twice ; the concierge gave us miserable directions that got us lost ; and the front desk was unable to rectify any issue. </s>
<s> amazed me that so much incompetence could happen in 6 hours ! And even after recognizing their shortcomings ; not one sincere or significant apology. </s>
<s> poster child of how bad service can not overcome a well-built ; well-furnished hotel. </s>
<s> Regency Chicago - I thought that the Hyatt Regency in Chicago would be the perfect place to stay in Chicago ; because of its location and the recent renovations to the hotel. </s>
<s> ; I was not impressed with the slow service during check-in and the inconvenient room service hours. </s>
<s> took over an hour because of the long line ; and slow moving employees. </s>
<s> ; room service came to clean my room at 8 in the morning. </s>
<s> ; this was not the worst experience I had at a hotel ; but I am definitely never staying at the Hyatt again. </s>
<s> Omni Chicago Hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever had the oppertunity to visit. </s>
<s> only are the desk clerks very helpful ; but you feel like a celebrity when you visit. </s>
<s> workout room is great with lots of room so you do not feel cramp. </s>
<s> also have a great indoor pool and a spa. </s>
<s> also comes with 2 sundecks to get a nice tan. </s>
<s> you need a vacation ; this is the place to stay. </s>
<s> a wedding in Chicago ; Sofitel is new ; humming ; very very modern ' W hotel style - minimalist and a great location. </s>

<s>  </s>

<s> 
On the weekend I came back for a nap at about 3 : 30 PM after vacating the room at 8 : 30 AM and it still was n't made up. </s>

<s> called housekeeping for a new hairdryer and they never brought me one . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> I gave up . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> This is a hot ; youth hotel but for my next visit ; I think I 'd prefer some of the classic amenities likely timely housekeeping ; a somewhat larger room that you can walk around ; and a less trendy ; hot ; loud clientele. </s>
<s> 'm over 40. </s>
<s> Chicago ; Millennium Park -- The Fairmont Chicago hotel is nice ; I guess ; but I have a hard time justifying spending that much money per night on a little extra comfort. </s>
<s> food in the nearby restaurants was exquisite ; though also quite pricey ' but easier to justify for me. </s>
<s> rooms seemed well decorated however the lighting was a bit dim ; I think it was meant to give the rooms a homely feel however all I saw was a nice room whose darkness was a little depressing. </s>
<s> 's an undeniably nice hotel ; but I do n't think I 'll ever again be willing to part with that much money for marginal increases in comfort. </s>
<s> stayed at the Hard Rock hotel in Chicago last year and can say i was not satisfied with my experience. </s>
<s> feel that it did n't live up to what was advertised and the accommodations were sub-par at best. </s>
<s> had the chance to catch a show and the music was too loud and the sound guy 's work resembled that of an amateur. </s>
<s> personal rating is 2 '5 stars and i would not recommend this hotel to a friend. </s>

<s> stayed in a spacious suite. </s>

<s> bed was very comfortable. </s>
<s> were great. </s>

<s> staff were consistently attentive and responsive. </s>
<s> is evident that everyone is very well-trained. </s>
<s> would love to stay here again. </s>
<s> reviews complain about the small rooms. </s>
<s> a major city ; we found our room quite comfortable with a king bed and really nice furnishings. </s>
<s> feature we liked is the ability to open the window. </s>
<s> Knikerbocker is a small boutique hotel right off Michigan Avenue in the best area of Chicago. </s>
<s> staff was friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> the $ 116 we paid on Hotwire ; we could not have found a better room in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> Regency Chicago This was my first trip into Chicago and I have to say that experience was not made better by the Hyatt Regency. </s>
<s> booked this hotel at the recommendation of a friend ; and even though it was expensive ; my friend told me it would be worth it. </s>
<s> specifically requested a room facing the river ; but instead I got a room near to the ground facing the boring office building across the street. </s>
<s> I went to sort out things at the front desk ; they treated me like a dead fish and tried to placate me with complementary wifi for my stay ' which never worked. </s>
<s> rooms are fine but they 're not worth the trouble. </s>
<s> 'm never coming back and I 'll think twice before staying at a Hyatt again. </s>
<s> was genuinely surprised by my stay at this hotel. </s>
<s> walls were paper thin ; and I could hear conversations in the next room. </s>
<s> is not something I would have expected from a higher class of hotel. </s>
<s> room was also smaller than I would have expected for the price. </s>
<s> were given minimal toiletries and towels in the guest room ; something which made it difficult for two people to get ready in the morning. </s>
<s> requested new towels ; but it took an entire day for them to get around to fulfilling our request. </s>
<s> check-in process was frustrating ; mostly due to the unhappy clerk behind the counter. </s>
<s> do n't know if she was having a bad day ; or just happens to be in such a mood all the time ; but either way ; it was unpleasant and a pain to deal with. </s>
<s> ; not a pleasant experience. </s>

<s> stunning bay at Chicago finds its equal in the Ambassador East Hotel. </s>
<s> hotel feels like luxury was built into everything ; down to the wonderful room service and conference rooms. </s>
<s> being in an active neighborhood in Chicago ; the Ambassador East is close enough to the action and beautiful sights Chicago has to offer. </s>
<s> overall service of the hotel was wonderful. </s>
<s> felt like I was treated as a king. </s>
<s> room was very neat ; regal ; and relaxing. </s>
<s> especially liked the bathroom as it was clean and soothing. </s>
<s> Pump Room was also a great place for excellent dining. </s>
<s> stay here was completely enjoyable while maintaining a high level of productivity. </s>
<s> ; the stay here was fantastic and worth every penny. </s>
<s> would return to the Ambassador East Hotel in a heartbeat if given the opportunity. </s>
<s> small boutique hotel is tucked away in a perfect location between the Loop and the Miracle Mile. </s>
<s> blocks west of the Wrigley Building and so convenient to restaurants ; etc. </s>
<s> staff ; from doormen to desk folks are extra nice and accommodating. </s>
<s> delicious breakfast on each floor is ultra-convenient ; the evening happy hour is more than generous ; and the morning paper is welcome. </s>
<s> is so comfortable. </s>
<s> is our second stay ; and certainly not our last. </s>
<s> love Chicago ; and this hotel is one of the reasons why. </s>
<s> is a beautiful hotel with a great view of the Chicago River and a short walk to all the best places to visit in the city ! I had an unbelievably pleasant and relaxing stay with an in-room massage and fantastic room service. </s>
<s> you 're looking for a vacation in Chicago and want to experience the best the city has to offer as well as live in luxury and comfort ; I highly recommend this hotel and I would definitely come again !

<s> mean ; I 'm kind of a music person ; but this was my first real experience with a musically " themed " hotel. </s>
<s> staying here ; however ; I am convinced that I made the right choice in my stay. </s>
<s> dining accommodations were excellent ; and I was served probably some of the best food I 've ever eaten at a hotel. </s>
<s> was intelligently placed in downtown Chicago ; and I would n't have to walk too far to see some street performers ; or just take in the majesty of the city itself. </s>
<s> room I had booked had an excellent view of the skyline ; and I could 've easily sat for hours ; just marveling at the city sprawled out before me. </s>
<s> whole " Hard Rock " and musical aspect of the hotel was just the icing on the cake of my stay. </s>
<s> I had to stay here again ; I would ! We stayed in the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago in a standard guest room. </s>
<s> rooms had just been renovated ; but the changes did not make much of a difference. </s>
<s> room was so small ; it felt like we were sleeping below deck on a boat. </s>
<s> decor was drab and there was nothing special about the room. </s>
<s> were excited about the bathrobe and slippers that came with the room ; but we assumed there would be a bathrobe and a pair of slippers for each of us ; there was only one bathrobe and one pair of slippers. </s>
<s> called the front desk to ask for a second set and were treated like we were trying to scam the hotel and refused to send them. </s>
<s> would not have mattered if they sent a second set ; the bathrobe was so scratchy it gave me a rash and there were stains on the slippers. </s>
<s> hotel guests ; we expected to be treated with respect and enjoy the stay we paid for. </s>
<s> were severely disappointed. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and there is no way I 'll be going back. </s>
<s> in took a long time as there many people arriving for a conference and only a single staff member at the reception desk. </s>
<s> room itself was barely passable - the bathroom seemed to need a good cleaning and the room itself looked like it had seen better days long before I ever was here. </s>
<s> the price I was paying ; you 'd think they 'd allow access to the work out facilities ; but they wanted an outrageous PER DAY charge ! Top it off with the small pool and no hot tub and you wo n't want to be spending any time here at all. </s>
<s> top it off ; the promised discount rate was n't honored at the end of my stay ; despite being assured that all was well at check in ! I ended up arguing with the manager about it when I was checking out - since I had to catch a flight ; no resolution happened and as of yet ; I 'm still waiting for responses to my calls and letters. </s>
<s> has a lot better hotels to offer and for the price per night I paid ; it was n't worth it. </s>
<s> the Shula 's was n't enough to make me want to return here. </s>

<s> door and bellmen 'women were particularly pleasant and helpful and the concierge was friendly and knowledgeable. </s>
<s> had completely satisfactory ' though overpriced drinks in the bar but did n't eat at the restaurant. </s>
<s> health club was fine and the equipment was well maintained. </s>
<s> there were only three treadmills and two elipitical steppers ; I never had to wait for a machine although it might be a different story in the dead of a Chicago winter ! One minor quibble -- I like to have coffee first thing in the morning and there was no in-room coffee maker. </s>
<s> restaurant offered free coffee " to-go " but only before eight AM. </s>
<s> is a very ; very comfortable ; attractive hotel in a wonderful location. </s>
<s> is an expensive city but we felt that we got a reasonable value for our money. </s>
<s> ; the hotel was okay. </s>
<s> I did have a problem with the price. </s>
<s> accommodations mentioned on the website were accurate ' other than the supposedly luxury mattress ; it was not more comfortable than my own mattress ! ; but this hotel offers nothing more than a much more affordable hotel ! There is a difference between the Palmer House Hilton lobby ; and your normal ; affordable lobby. </s>
<s> ; I do not go to a hotel because it has a fancy lobby ; I go to get a good night 's sleep. </s>
<s> I want to sight see ; I go elsewhere. </s>
<s> I said ; overall ; the hotel was okay ; but it was not worth the price. </s>
<s> found this hotel in the " Small Luxury Hotels of the World " booklet having stayed in many of these in recent years ; and they were indeed above and beyond average hotels. </s>
<s> therefore chose it for a 4 night stay while visiting from England. </s>
<s> Talbott was excellently located ; although i had a view of a building site ; and did have an ambience and some charm ; however it was a little dirty and faded around the edges and the service was appalling. </s>
<s> had to wait in the foyer well after check in time ; having previously attempted to check in earlier ; tired and in need of a rest ; while a " final check " was done to my room. </s>
<s> valet parking was not outside when requested ; breakfast was not included in the price ; all the things requested of reception did not occur ; and there were very few touches which make a hotel stay special. </s>
<s> have stayed in hotels which are so much more elegant ; where the staff and service are first rate for half the price of this hotel. </s>
<s> was severely disappointed and can not recommend it at all. </s>
<s> as a luxury hotel the Conrad Chicago is more gouge than grand. </s>
<s> wife and I decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in Chicago for our tenth anniversary. </s>
<s> looking at several hotels in the " Magnificent Mile " territory of downtown Chicago we selected the Conrad. </s>
<s> Conrad 's website impressed us immediately. </s>
<s> pictures of the rooms were lovely ; they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions ; not that we were planning to watch much tv. </s>
<s> called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system ; I was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who could n't figure out how I was unable to make my reservations via the automated system. </s>
<s> any case I picked the deluxe king-size bed room for two nights in mid September. </s>
<s> wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online ; most impressed with the view. </s>
<s> cost a pretty penny ; more than I would normally spend on out of town accomidations ; but her happiness was worth it. </s>
<s> her happiness was short lived after arrival at the Conrad. </s>

<s> the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system. </s>
<s> explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king-sized room but at an additional cost. </s>
<s> the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay. </s>
<s> ended when we found out that our " view " was of a back alley service corridor. </s>
<s> much for the skyline. </s>
<s> ; the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow. </s>
<s> hate to be picky but I was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up. </s>
<s> spa had very limited hours as well. </s>
<s> amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams ; away from the hotel. </s>
<s> was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count. </s>
<s> would not recommend the Conrad Chicago. </s>
<s> would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in Chicago. </s>
<s> was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid-range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms ; but would n't have cleaned out so much of my wallet. </s>
<s> returned from a week in Chicago with the family. </s>
<s> hotel was perfect for us. </s>
<s> is great ; kids loved the pool as a place to wind down after a day of museums ; touring ; ball games ; etc. </s>
<s> checked in through Hilton Honors Desk as opposed to the regular check in line. </s>

<s> must say that we found the staff to be wonderful ; but the accommodations to be quite disappointing. </s>
<s> were given room ' 1605. </s>
<s> this room at all costs ! The adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you awake most of the night ' and then awaken you at 6 AM. </s>
<s> addition ; we had requested a king bed ; and ' 1605 has two doubles. </s>
<s> were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room. </s>
<s> the very friendly staff and its super location ; the Talbott was less than what we expected ; and we would probably not stay there again. </s>
<s> rooms were beautiful ! The staff was friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> love where the Conrad in Chicago was located ; it seemed to be close to a lot of places I wanted to visit. </s>
<s> was great ; and the Conrad Hotel made my family and my stay that much more exceptional ! For the price ; you would think this would be a top quality hotel ; but it was nowhere close. </s>
<s> at check-in was slow and unfriendly. </s>
<s> room was even worse. </s>
<s> was small ; dirty and smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though I had requested a non-smoking room. </s>
<s> cover on the bed was stained ; there was hair all over the bathroom floor ; and the curtain rod was almost falling off the wall. </s>
<s> looked tired and in desperate need of a remodel. </s>
<s> also did n't appreciate having to pay for wifi ; when other premium hotels offer it for free. </s>
<s> ; this was one of the worst hotels I have stayed at in a long time ; and considering the price ; it was terrible. </s>
<s> am a fan of Kimpton Hotels ; however I have never experienced top service as I did at the Hotel Allegro. </s>
<s> before my visit ; concierge Mark Kraemer advised us on things to see ; and booked tickets in advance to Second City. </s>
<s> were welcomed warmly on arrival ; and the bellman checked up on us as we came and went from the hotel. </s>
<s> the staff have a personal interest in making your stay a great experience. </s>
<s> hotel is next to City Hall ; where I had some business. </s>
<s> had a large quiet room ; and used room service-the meal came quickly ; and included a a bonus fruit cup. </s>
<s> the pasta night ' 20 dollars for a three course meal at the 312 restaurant-the starter and the dessert were wonderful ; the main pasta a bit too salty. </s>
<s> that is the only complaint I can make-from start to finish ; if you want attentive service ; this is the place to be. </s>
<s> you ; Hotel Allegro ; for a great stay. </s>
<s> ca n't wait to return. </s>
<s> was extremly unhappy with my recent stay at Affinia Chicago ! When I arrived to check in ; my reservation that I had made ; ' and confirmed ; 2 weeks earlier ; was not in the computer. </s>
<s> had to wait 40 minutes in the lobby while a room was being cleaned for me. </s>
<s> whole time the desk clerk gave me dirty looks and texted non-stop on her cell phone ; while the office phone rang off the hook. </s>
<s> had no toilet paper in my restroom or trash can in room. </s>
<s> 'll never go back ; dont waste your money. </s>
<s> Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel ; I travel a lot on business and consequently stay at a lot of different hotels. </s>
<s> are mediocre at best ; and I rarely bother to write a review ; but the Monaco was a cut above. </s>
<s> ; big rooms ; well appointed ; and with a lot of attention to details like high thread-count linens ; authentic woodwork and upholstery ; marble counter tops ; plush carpets and tasteful artwork - gave my room just the right touch of luxury. </s>
<s> was only in town one night ; but it was a warm evening so I was able to explore the area a little - lots of decent places to eat within an easy walk - no need to take my car out of the parking garage. </s>
<s> only downside was that I was on one of the lower floors and the noise from the street was a little loud. </s>
<s> next time I stay here ' and I will surely choose this hotel next time I 'm in Chicago ; I will make sure I get a room on one of the upper floors where I imagine the noise will be less intrusive. </s>
<s> Suites- I have to say ; I was n't too sure about staying at the Homewood Suites- I 've had problems with Hilton Hotels in the past. </s>
<s> ; I was delightfully surpirsed by my weekend stay here. </s>
<s> rooms were the nicest I 've ever stayed at ; nice and spacious yet cozy. </s>
<s> staff was very helpful ; I 'm not very familiar with Chicago ; so the doorman gave me some recommendations of where to visit. </s>
<s> that I had to leave the hotel to enjoy myself- the pool was fantastic and the gym was very stae-of-the-art. </s>
<s> only complaint was the noise from the streets below ; but that 's the price you pay to stay at a hotel so centrally located. </s>
<s> ca n't wait to find an excuse to go back to Chicago so I can stay here again ! Conrad Chicago - The place looks very fancy and they want you to believe everything is perfect there. </s>
<s> would seem that it 's actually not. </s>
<s> Terrace restaurant is very pricey and has nothing really impressive about it. </s>
<s> food was bland. </s>
<s> the room was okay ; the service was not. </s>
<s> will charge you for every single service you ask ; explicitly expect a tip ; and last but not least will forget about the specifics of your requests. </s>
<s> something I was used to in this kind of Hotels. </s>
<s> place had character I 'll give it that. </s>
<s> it was n't really my style. </s>
<s> late in the evening. </s>
<s> first room they gave me the TV did n't work. </s>
<s> took a look at it ; and could n't figure it out. </s>
<s> me I 'd have to wait until the morning for the electrician. </s>
<s> then passed some gas and left. </s>
<s> professional. </s>
<s> phoned the front desk on account of the tv ; and was able to get another room The second room was much like the first. </s>
<s> striped wall paper ; dingy ; and old worn carpet. </s>
<s> was incredibly small. </s>
<s> to use the toliet without banging into the door ; or the sink. </s>
<s> cramped. </s>
<s> beds were n't very comfortable either. </s>
<s> temp hard to regulate and the AC somewhat noisy. </s>
<s> seem very convenient. </s>
<s> was there for a training session about 8 blocks away. </s>
<s> all of the theatres seemed to be near by ; if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two. </s>
<s> do n't make a long distance phone call from your room without a calling card. </s>
<s> was about $ 2 'minute. </s>
<s> knew it would be expensive but was n't expecting that type of rate. </s>
<s> recently stayed in The James Hotel in Chicago and trust me I will never do it again. </s>
<s> you pay a premium price you 'd expect first rate service. </s>
<s> whole experience was a disaster though short lived b 'c we could stay their another second. </s>
<s> we arrived at the hotel we had to wait while the receptionist finished playing with her phone for service and then our room was not ready. </s>
<s> we had to wait in the lobby with our baggage. </s>
<s> we finally got to the room I would n't exactly call it clean but it was n't to bad. </s>
<s> pictures on the website are nice enough but the furniture is falling apart and probably from Walmart. </s>
<s> was plenty of space for an average person of 5 but I 'm 6 '4 " and the beds where smaller than what they said ; not to mention uncomfortable. </s>
<s> ordered room service and not only did they bring us the wrong order but it took 2 hours. </s>
<s> walls were also paper thin so we got little sleep. </s>
<s> heater helped block out some noise until it stopped working in the middle of the night. </s>
<s> the next morning ; sore from the uncomfortable bed ; hungry tired and cold we checked out before we even had our coffee. </s>
<s> away ! we chose to stay at this hotel after talking to one of my friends and now i write to tell you we had an excellent stay at the talbott. </s>
<s> staff all very helpful and friendly but let me in particular mark mr tim the concierge who is so professional helpful. </s>
<s> knowledgable. </s>
<s> hotel 's location is wonderful-ideal for touring business. </s>
<s> only thing I do n't like is the hotel does n't have free wifi. </s>
<s> recently remodeled Affina was amazing - from the 6 choice pillow menu to the stocked " pantry and refrigerator " to the brand name bathroom ammenities. </s>
<s> walking distance to just about everything you could possibly need ; the Affina is a great hotel. </s>
<s> staff was pleasant and seemed to enjoy their jobs. </s>
<s> never stayed in downtown Chicago before ; the Affina over and above exceeded our expectations. </s>
<s> our trip to Chicago was only for one night ; we will consider staying at the Affina again for a future visit. </s>
<s> husband and I visited this hotel on our way home from our honeymoon. </s>
<s> 's a very nice hotel ; but the valet parking is very expensive ; $ 53. </s>
<s> per night was rather high so we opted to park our own car. </s>
<s> pool was very nice ; and the water was warm. </s>
<s> front desk was very nice and helpful ; If I ever visited Chicago again I would stay there. </s>
<s> just returned from 4 nights at the Ambassador East. </s>
<s> a gem ! The location in the Gold Coast neighborhood is perfect for finding restaurants and walking the Magnificent Mile. </s>
<s> is a train station about 2 blocks away. </s>
<s> room was very comfortable ; with nice amenities ; and there is free Internet service on the 2nd floor. </s>
<s> of all was the bell and lobby staff ! They really went out of their way to be helpful and greeted us warmly each time we left and arrived. </s>
<s> would say that this was the nicest hotel staff I 've encountered in all my travels. </s>
<s> want everyone to know about the awful experience I had at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. </s>
<s> we arrived at the hotel ; the clerk who was checking us in said that our reservation was not in the system ' I had called earlier in the day and confirmed it. </s>
<s> speaking to the on-duty manager we were informed that our reservation had been canceled earlier in the day and that the hotel was now completely booked. </s>
<s> later found out that there was a convention at the hotel and that the price for the rooms had risen dramatically. </s>
<s> believe they canceled our reservation just so they could make more money. </s>
<s> for one wo n't be going back to this hotel ! We recently completed our second stay at the Fairmont Chicago. </s>
<s> check-in process was quick and painless but the front desk staff was almost disinterested in the whole procedure. </s>
<s> is fine when I am traveling on business ; but on leisure trips I would appreciate a warmer greeting. </s>
<s> hotel was hosting a convention at the same time as our stay ; but other than seeing some signage 'attendees in the lobby ; we would n't have noticed. </s>
<s> is probably due to the separation of the conference areas from the guest rooms and the 8 speedy elevators. </s>
<s> stayed in a Parkview Suite so we had a large room with a great view of Millenium Park. </s>
<s> anteroom was well appointed with a sofa ; coffee table ; desk ; mini-bar with sink and coffee maker ; and dining area. </s>
<s> bedroom appeared to be the same as a standard Fairmont room ; but maybe slightly larger. </s>
<s> bathroom also appeared to be similar to a standard Fairmont room ; and once again ; possibly slightly larger. </s>
<s> upscale modern decor is pleasing but not overtly luxurious ; and several small touches such as a shoe shine station ' with extra collar tabs ; are peppered throughout. </s>
<s> booked a few evening activities through the concierge and everything was perfectly handled. </s>
<s> hotel restaurant ; Aria ; could n't find our reservation but they oddly new my name and remembered that the hotel had called to make a reservation for us. </s>
<s> had no problem seating us and the dinner ' both food and service was lovely. </s>
<s> complaints : The pillows could be better. </s>
<s> 'm not sure if they remembered our preference for non-down bedding from our last visit ; but seriously ; these things barely felt like pillows. </s>
<s> 'll suffer through some congestion if I can get better neck support. </s>
<s> ; the valet parking attendants seem overly eager to take your car ' and charge you $ 49. </s>
<s> as I mentioned above ; the front desk experience could be improved. </s>
<s> feature : After our first stay ; I gave a brief review in the comments section of the Fairmont President 's Club ' membership is free website. </s>
<s> received a phone call from the Director of Rooms the same day asking to discuss our experience. </s>
<s> this stay ; I left a comment essentially thanking the hotel staff for a great stay ; but still received a warm ; friendly phone call from the Director of Rooms asking if he could do anything to improve our next stay. </s>
<s> to the Fairmont for taking its customers seriously ; and for that ; they 've won my loyalty. </s>
<s> traveled to Chicago for a business trip ; and I ended up staying at the Millenium. </s>
<s> front desk was rude to me ; and it took me a good 15 minutes to check in. </s>
<s> the restaurant and bar are overpriced ; and the food is n't even that good for the price. </s>
<s> even though I specifically asked for a room with a lake view ; I was given one that faced the city. </s>
<s> room was average sized ; and the bathroom was n't anything impressive ; despite what everyone seems to be saying. </s>
<s> not visit again. </s>
<s> was looking for an unique ; hip experience in a hotel that offered the convenient location of downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> choice for hotel was obvious : Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. </s>
<s> you are wondering whether Hard Rock Hotels are schmaltzy or cliche ; they are not. </s>
<s> Rock Hotel Chicago is modern ; trendy and hip. </s>
<s> had an air that this was where musicians came to rock among the 40 stories ; and there are details that you wo n't find elsewhere. </s>
<s> example ; one interesting perk is some free iTunes downloads ' I got ten for guests. </s>
<s> 's a fun place ; hosting events such as Jack Daniel 's 160th birthday. </s>
<s> booked this hotel for an adult weekend away on Priceline ; paid $ 85 which thought was good price for a 4 in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> location is great. </s>
<s> hotel minimally OK> Unsure how it gets a 4 rating. </s>
<s> is old and though clean the decor is definitely jaded and needing a face lift. </s>
<s> were pleasant and overall it was a good stay. </s>
<s> I would NOT recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> would rather have paid $ 100 and got something more updated - trouble with old it tends to look somewhat seedy and this was true in this case. </s>
<s> suggestion DO NOT BOOK PRICELINE FOR CHICAGO IL AND ASK FOR 4 BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO GET . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> NOT GOOD ENOUGH PRICELINE. </s>
<s> ! IN MY OPINION. </s>
<s> place with European charm. </s>
<s> complaints ; great location ; ' never like parking in Chicago ; though. </s>
<s> was $ 35 a night next door. </s>
<s> beautiful lobby ; a touch of class. </s>
<s> location for downtown ; Navy Pier ; and the great Grant Park 'Millenium Park ; too . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> Loved it. </s>
<s> Chicago-I had a very relaxing stay at the James. </s>
<s> hotel is in a prime location near the Millenium Park ; restaurants and the famous Mag Mile. </s>
<s> room was very spacious with a cool ; hip design and a great skyline view. </s>
<s> interior vibe ; from the lighting and the sleek woodtone ; was calming. </s>
<s> bathroom was well-maintained and instant hot water and fresh toiletries were readily available. </s>
<s> also provided pillow options and room plants on request and the bed was perfect. </s>
<s> was pleasantly suprised to find chocolate treats placed on the bed after returning from a day of shopping. </s>
<s> made full use of the fully equipped gym and liked that the restaurant had vegan options. </s>
<s> I was impressed by the quality of service from the chauffeur-driven Audi for shopping to the food and exercise options and I look forward to my next visit ! I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> stay here was wonderful thanks to such a friendly staff. </s>
<s> needed to do some research for work and the free Wi-Fi made this very easy. </s>
<s> bed was so nice and soft ! Even the pillows were fluffy. </s>
<s> was able to put my valuables in the in-room safe. </s>
<s> local restaurants were amazing. </s>
<s> will recommend this to my friends and I am staying here again in the future. </s>
<s> hotel must have originally been an ordinary downtown hotel in a not very nice neighborhood. </s>
<s> owners have painted it over and fixed up the lobby to make it an " upscale " overpriced boutique hotel. </s>
<s> it 's still just an ordinary hotel with a paint job. </s>
<s> here if you want to experience staying in a flophouse ; but with all the sleaze removed. </s>
<s> stay at the chain 's other location ; the Burnham ; for a much ; much nicer hotel. </s>
<s> just got back from a great weekend in Chicago and have no complaints about the Palmer House. </s>
<s> 's very easy to get to from O 'hare 'the Blue line on the EL train and then just a 2 block walk from the train station. </s>
<s> hotel itself is beautiful and the staff is super friendly and go out of their way to help. </s>
<s> booked an air 'hotel package deal on Expedia. </s>
<s> expected to stay in a room with a full size bed but for only $ 45 extra per night we upgraded to the Excutive level ! Best decision of the trip. </s>
<s> had a beautiful room with a King bed ; down comforter ; robes ; plush towels etc . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it also included a nice Continental breakfast each morning ; all day snacks and beverages and a great happy hour ! We took advantage of this every day. </s>
<s> location was great . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> lots of shopping along State St. </s>
<s> and to get to the Magnificent Mile was a $ 5 cab ride or a 20 minute walk ! We 'll be back to Chicago and the Palmer House ! A disappointment to say the least. </s>
<s> have heard rave after rave about Hotel Allegro and was super excited when our brother-in-law gave us an American Express gift card that we decided to use for a night out ! I called Hotel Allegro and made the reservation for a Saturday night. </s>
<s> person who took the reservation was very sweet and assured me that there would be no problem using the gift card ; since they do indeed take American Express. </s>
<s> could n't wait to get there ! We arrive at Hotel Allegro at about 3 : 00 on Saturday afternoon. </s>
<s> ; the tourist ; I am already taking pics of the sign out front and trying to get a sneek peak of the ballroom set up for a wedding. </s>
<s> get in the line to check in. </s>
<s> give them the gift card and my check card. </s>
<s> tell me that neither one will work because they are charging the cards for not only the room rate ; but for incidentals as well. </s>
<s> give them a credit card instead. </s>
<s> in line checking in ; we hear complaint after complaint from other guests and I start to wonder what our experience is going to be like. </s>
<s> guy at the front desk is on the radio with the bell-man. </s>
<s> 's luggage has been lost. </s>
<s> desk clerk snaps at the bell-man for the entire line to see. </s>
<s> impressed. </s>
<s> get to our little shoebox of a room that I was so disappointed to see. </s>
<s> rooms on the website looked glorious ! My bedroom at home is nicer than this tiny room. </s>
<s> sink is too small - water splashes everywhere even as evident by the water all over the floor when we got into our room. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> stay the night and go to check out in the morning. </s>
<s> ; I give them the American Express gift card. </s>
<s> clerk says " their system usually does n't take them " . </s>
<s> tell him that I called to confirm that their system would take it on Friday. </s>
<s> swipes the card and bam ! it works ! What do you know ? ? He was so rude. </s>
<s> will not stay at Hotel Allegro again ; nor would I recommend it to anyone. </s>
<s> a disappointment ! I have stayed at the Omni off an on over the years. </s>
<s> business ; for personal trips. </s>
<s> trip started off quite rocky ; and left me very un-impressed. </s>
<s> Be aware ; they have a new policy where they charge debit card $ 55 per day for " incidentals " which you ' may incur. </s>
<s> do this if you elect not to use a standard credit card. </s>
<s> if you have booked and paid for your room in advance. </s>
<s> desk clerk claimed " all the hotels do this now " . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> funny how when I put a remote employee at the O 'Hare hilton on my business debit card ; I was never asked for additional funds. </s>
<s> a policy is one thing ; spreading blame for it is another. </s>
<s> not a problem for me ; someone who plans trips down to the dollar and dime might encounter a problem with this " policy " of theirs. </s>
<s> my knowledge ; they never did this sort of thing before. </s>
<s> I do n't use Credit Cards ; its why I have money in a recession. </s>
<s> 2 Rooms were clean ; but their in room accoutrements and mini bar items had no price list. </s>
<s> only thing labelled with a price was a bottle of water ' about 600 ML for $ 7. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> such ; be careful with the tray of goodies. </s>
<s> the water is $ 7. </s>
<s> ; imagine what the snickers bar might cost. </s>
<s> Our suite had a bathroom sliding door between the bedroom and bathroom which appeared broken ; and would not move. </s>
<s> the front desk resulted in . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  nothing. </s>
<s> about 9 : 00 PM I elected to have another look at it ; and it seemed to be off its track. </s>
<s> was able to successfully " fix " it ; but the lack of response from maintenance ; considering the rate for a suite ; is sad. </s>
<s> remember this hotel being much more attentive and responsive. </s>
<s> The seem to cut a lot of corners on room stocking now. </s>
<s> ; I think I will be skipping the Omni ; and they will get no more of my business. </s>
<s> seems Hilton treats people better overall. </s>
<s> 's quite sad ; as I have a lot of good memories with Omni. </s>
<s> will not be back. </s>
<s> made reservations with the Chicago Fitzpatrick using their 800 number for two nights in June. </s>
<s> received no written confirmation with cancelation policy ; etc. </s>
<s> ; when I attempted to cancel my reservation the morning of my first night 's reservation ; I was told that they would charge me for one nights stay. </s>
<s> have a " 3pm THE DAY BEFORE your first nights stay " policy. </s>
<s> though the hotel was not sold out for the night they would not budge on the policy. </s>
<s> is not a common policy on Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> 'd advise making your reservations someplace that offers more flexiblity for emergencies or sends a written confirmation with policy. </s>
<s> was a very expensive mistake on my part to book with this hotel ! This was a wonderful stay. </s>
<s> staff was extremely helpful ; The rooms are especially large ; and the fact they have a small kitchen makes everything a lot more easy. </s>
<s> breakfast and supper were excellent. </s>
<s> go out of their way to make you feel comfortable - for instance ; they have take-away plates you can take up to your room. </s>
<s> business center ; gym and pool also make this my first choice next time in Chicago. </s>
<s> air-condition has a noisy fan 'compressor in each room. </s>
<s> starts every 3 to 5 min and the noise will wake you up. </s>
<s> least the first night. </s>
<s> is an old fashion system that needs to be replaced. </s>
<s> postal service at the hotel is non-working. </s>
<s> hotel messed up our concert tickets that was correctly addressed and transported by UPS. </s>
<s> tickets were at the Hotel General Managers office. </s>
<s> reception denied that they had arrived. </s>
<s> had to spend most of a day travelling to the ticket agent to resolve it. </s>
<s> Hotel did not find any reason to apologize for the inconvenience. </s>
<s> concert was the reason for our travel to Chicago. </s>
<s> ; the Hotel had good standard ; free internet in the lobby ; not to good view from the rooms ; and friendly staff at the restaurants and the bars. </s>
<s> had booked 20 room-nights all together staying at room 612 ; 425 and 431 from the 23rd June. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park while travelling for business. </s>
<s> an incredible experience ! Friends had stayed there years ago ; but when we showed them our photos ; they could n't believe the amazing renovations. </s>
<s> we loved the modern decor and style ; our main reason for choosing this hotel was because of what they call Fairmont PURE rooms. </s>
<s> have had so many awful allergy attacks while travelling ; so I was n't too optimistic that they could actually make a truly hypoallergenic and allergy-free room. </s>
<s> have to say I felt great during our entire stay. </s>
<s> enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine and incredible cheese and appetizers at Eno. </s>
<s> a treat to get such amazing food and wine without even having to walk out of the hotel. </s>
<s> hotel is truly beautiful ; everything you would expect from a high-end ; big city hotel. </s>
<s> stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park did n't disappoint us in any respect. </s>
<s> only disappointment ? We do n't have a reason to go back to Chicago anytime soon ; but I have a feeling we will be making reservations for another visit in the very near future. </s>
<s> stayed at the Hilton Chicago because I was attending a conference at the hotel. </s>
<s> room was sufficient - had a coffee maker ; bed ; hangers ; tv ; etc. </s>
<s> 's about where my compliments end : ' restaurant rates are outrageous. </s>
<s> 21 for a breakfast buffet ? $ 25 to use the gym ? $ 7. </s>
<s> 'hr for WiFi ! ? ! ? ! This is unacceptable when I 'm paying $ 249 per night. </s>
<s> goodness the ice was free. </s>
<s> servers in the restaurant and bar were surly ; not well-versed in English ; and just rude. </s>
<s> computer monitors in rooms are silly and turn on at random times during the night ' conference was incredibly cold . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> everybody was wearing their overcoats the entire time ; despite our complaints to management. </s>
<s> fridge in room was not usable. </s>
<s> to store cold items in the ice bucket. </s>
<s> Cable channels just flat out SUCKED. </s>
<s> was soooo bored when I had to spend an hour in my room. </s>
<s> I 'm paying that much ; at least provide the full 70 channels. </s>
<s> husband and I stay at the Amalfi every year for our anniversary. </s>
<s> just love it ! The service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly. </s>
<s> hotel has very good cuisine options ; which are all very tasty ! The hotel is in close proximity to downtown and all the fun things going on there. </s>
<s> rooms are very comfortable and quiet. </s>
<s> for relaxing ! Will definitely keep coming back ! I was looking for a fun ; contemporary hotel and it did n't deliver. </s>
<s> lobby was nice ; and the rooms were mostly clean ; but it really was n't special. </s>
<s> time was slow for room requests ; I found empty water bottles under the chair ; and the a Stayed for 3 nights for our anniversary. </s>
<s> desk clerk was great and since it was our anniversary ; he gave us an upgrade . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> imagine our surprise when we got off on a floor with only 3 other rooms ! Corner tower suite with a view of the river and Michigan ave. </s>
<s> ! Cabs available right outside the lobby . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
Never paid more than $ 7 for a cab ride. </s>
<s> you go in Dec. </s>
<s> you must go to the ChrisKindl Festival for strudel ! We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in August. </s>
<s> waited a while to check in even though there were quite a few desks open ; this was a little annoying as the receptionists seemed to work in two 's. </s>
<s> room had a great view of Navy Pier and was a good size. </s>
<s> bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean. </s>
<s> location of the hotel is the best ; we walked to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> breakfast buffet was great although a little pricey and the bar very relaxing for a nightcap or two. </s>
<s> certainly recommend this hotel and would stay here again. </s>
<s> husband I stayed at the Fitzpatrick in early June 2004 for my birthday-great hotel ! Location provides easy walking to Navy Pier ; Marshall Field ; Michigan Avenue John Hancock. </s>
<s> seemed spacious even though its only about 300 sq ft. </s>
<s> Lots of room in bathroom ; comfortable bed ; very quiet ; upscale hotel. </s>
<s> would definitely stay here again ! Great location and quality place to stay. </s>
<s> large clean room with a queen size bed it was great. </s>
<s> were very helpful and put us onto some great restaurants and then some music bars. </s>
<s> on the front desk was a great guy to meet as a first impression he sold the hotel to us with his personality. </s>
<s> hotel delivered an anniversary cake to us in our room ' compliments of the hotel for me this showed that they care about their guests Many thanks to all it was a great place to stay. </s>
<s> pleasant front staff ; wine in the evening in the lobby ; large rooms ; great rates ; and free Internet for those that are members of the loyalty program. </s>
<s> an excellent value. </s>
<s> to the El for those coming in from either Midway or O 'Hare airports. </s>
<s> this was our first visit to the " windy city ; " we wanted to stay somewhere that was central and unique. </s>
<s> read many great reviews regarding the Kimpton brand so we gave it a go. </s>
<s> " go " ended up being a " no go. </s>
<s> " 
We were sorely disappointed. </s>
<s> we arrived the ladies at the front desk were very nice. </s>
<s> have two kids with us ; so we needed a crib for our 6 month baby. </s>
<s> were told " no problem. </s>
<s> " 
Unfortunately ; it took them about 1 or 2 hours to get us the crib and we were in a lurch as to what to do next. </s>
<s> ; we noticed a bug ' or bugs near the fridge area. </s>
<s> ! We called downstairs to complain and to be switched to a different room ' or floor !. </s>
<s> request was met about 30 minutes later. </s>
<s> this time ; we were so tired from the flight and the first impressions ; we almost wanted to throw the towel in. </s>
<s> service was so lacking ! We wanted to get settled and go grab a bit in the city ; but had to wait around for our new room and the crib. </s>
<s> is not what we expected at all for this HIGH price ! Will have to think hard before we book with a Kimpton hotel again. </s>
<s> went to stay at this hotel last year. </s>
<s> have got to say it was a great authentic experience ; the dining Restaurant was clean and fantastic the rooms were very comfortable with a friendly staff. </s>
<s> location could n't be more perfect so close you can walk to do some shopping. </s>
<s> at it from the outside at night is very beautiful. </s>
<s> is very affordable. </s>
<s> recommend this place to anyone and plan on staying again the next time i come to town. </s>
<s> : 'www. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> - My room was large ; clean ; and well furnished with a great view of the Chicago River. </s>
<s> hotel was located in the heart of Chicago ; directly next to the Magnificent Mile. </s>
<s> ; there was some city noise that was noticeable at night. </s>
<s> did n't bother me ; and overall my stay was very pleasant. </s>
<s> you have the money ; Amalfi Hotel is the place for you. </s>

<s> Hilton Chicago ; located on prime real estate in downtown Chicago ; has not aged as gracefully as other hotels around the country opened during the same period of time. </s>
<s> hotel does maintain the appearance of luxury that has made it iconic ; but that luxury is not in accord with 21st century standards. </s>
<s> any form of fitness center ; the Hilton is almost alone among the major hotels of Chicago in forcing its patrons to go elsewhere for a quick workout. </s>
<s> nominal fees for wireless internet use in hotel rooms is very rare at this point ; and the outrageous parking fee of $ 43 for guests will discourage out of towners from making the Hilton their destination. </s>
<s> guest rooms are no different than any other Hilton anywhere ; meaning that unless you are staying in the admittedly fantastic Executive suites ; you will be paying a premium for a prosaic hotel experience. </s>

<s> you its - 6 outside and we have luggage to carry too. </s>
<s> very good service for a 5-star hotel. </s>
<s> got inside and apparently they were running a nightclub out of thier lobby ; its called the harddrive. </s>
<s> 's cool and all ; yes it was very noisy but once we got to our room ; it was n't an issue. </s>
<s> HVAC controls to our room were broken. </s>
<s> first night we were ok ; but by the second night it was blazing hot in there ; 86 degrees. </s>
<s> hot we could n't sleep. </s>
<s> was miserable. </s>
<s> sent up the " engineer " and he determined that there was definately a problem and opened our window ; 24 floors up. </s>
<s> never did cool down enough in there we kept that window open all night. </s>
<s> was 5 below that night and the window being open 8 " did n't help. </s>
<s> would not put us in another room either. </s>
<s> checkout ; Monday morning ; our bill came to $ 240. </s>
<s> after taxes for the room. </s>
<s> then had a second bill in which our internet and parking was billed on for $ 56. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; I got my reciepts and went on our way. </s>
<s> Wednesday I was on my online banking checking my account ; to find that Hyatt charged me $ 289. </s>
<s> and another charge of $ 103. </s>
<s> ! That is almost $ 100 more than what the reciepts from checkout say. </s>
<s> was furious ; so I called the hotel. </s>
<s> was resolved by my phone call ; they treated me as if $ 100 is n't but something you wipe with. </s>
<s> said give it another day or two and see if the additional authorization falls off. </s>
<s> did n't settle well with me ; but what could I do. </s>
<s> waited. </s>
<s> Friday now. </s>
<s> check on my account again and the charges cleared as they should have with the correct original amounts ; and they still have " authorizations " on the two incorrect amounts as well. </s>
<s> have charged me an additional $ 300 ! Im so furious ! and guess what . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
Hyatt does n't care. </s>
<s> gave me the same -- line as they did Wednesday. </s>
<s> YOURSELF SOME HASSLE AND DO N'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL UNLESS YOU HAVE EXTRA MONEY FOR THEM TO PLAY WITH. </s>
<s> just returned from a stay at this fabulous hotel - what a treat ! The hotel website offers a great rate ; and what I found was affordable luxury. </s>
<s> asked for a high floor found myself with a fabulous view ; in a room where there was an orchid spray in the bathroom ; terrycloth robes and slippers ; turndown service ; Roger Gallet toiletries ; a fluffy down conforter ; and a wonderful pillowtop bed. </s>
<s> bathroom was so clean that it sparkled. </s>
<s> service was impeccable as well. </s>
<s> my room service breakfast was way above average with an incredibly generous basket of excellent croissants ; brioches ; pain au chocolat. </s>
<s> decor was unique the location convenient. </s>
<s> out the stunning flowers throughout the lobby. </s>
<s> is a topnotch hotel. </s>
<s> family and I stayed at this hotel during an extended weekend trip in July ; 08. </s>
<s> had ' 3 1 bedroom suites. </s>
<s> Location in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions. </s>
<s> service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly. </s>
<s> breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded. </s>
<s> recommend going early. </s>
<s> rooms were quiet and clean. </s>
<s> highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying >2-3 days. </s>
<s> would stay here again. </s>
<s> is expensive ; about $ 28 'day. </s>
<s> is valet. </s>
<s> cheapest self parking I could find in the area was $ 24 'days so we did valet parking. </s>
<s> valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly. </s>
<s> is my 3rd experience with Homewood Suites ' 3 different cities. </s>
<s> have had a great experience each time. </s>
<s> 'm sitting in the hotel as I right this review and am not impressed with the room. </s>
<s> hotel is not modern in the least - it feels like you 're staying in your grandmother 's attic. </s>
<s> is peeling off the wall ; not well lit ; very few outlets in the room -- especially convenient ones ' none next to the bed or built into lamps ; terrible views and loud construction noises woke me up at 7am. </s>
<s> the location is off the beaten path - closest L stop is on the Red Line -- so not accessible via the loop stops on the blue line from the airport without transferring. </s>
<s> club is not on site either. </s>
<s> are hundreds of other hotels I would stay in over this one. </s>
<s> n't have asked for a better home base for checking out downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> Sofitel is right in the heart of the action ; allowing my friends and I to hit the clubs and enjoy the local cuisine downtown 's famous for. </s>
<s> room was comfy ; with two queen mattresses ; down stuffed duvets and chic decor. </s>
<s> bar downstairs was a bit pricey ; but made up for it by being comfortable ; sleek ; and staffed with attentive bartenders who made excellent cocktails. </s>
<s> night we did n't feel like going out so we headed downstairs to eat at the Cafe des Architectes ; which had an amazing array of choices ; mostly of the French persuasion. </s>
<s> would definitely book here again ! I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel a couple of weeks ago while in Chicago for 3 nights. </s>
<s> must say ; I was NOT impressed. </s>
<s> is an example of a hotel that tries too hard with little result except for inflating your bill. </s>
<s> start with ; the hotel lobby was totally gaudy. </s>
<s> had sculptures and artwork that seemed meaningless and I guess was supposed to give an air of style. </s>
<s> room was ok I suppose ; but certainly not worth the premium price I paid for it. </s>
<s> hotel food was presented like it was some kind of amazing French cuisine ; but the food ; while arranged nicely ; tasted unremarkable and again ; was overpriced. </s>
<s> final verdict is avoid this hotel if at all possible. </s>
<s> is simply not worth it. </s>
<s> Swissotel Chicago is a very mediocre hotel ; the service is always poor ; and the room service food always comes cold ; unless it 's supposed to be cold than it comes warm. </s>
<s> would rather stay at a super 8 than this place again. </s>
<s> was the best choice my husband and I could have chosen to visit ! The Hotel has stunning views from all around and the best part is that it is near the water ! I was perfectly happy to enjoy the luxurious rooms and comfortable decor while my husband enjoyed the solace the found in the free gym. </s>
<s> was so clean and invoting. </s>
<s> The Pump Room ; there was so much history in one rooom. </s>
<s> ; we had a great ; relaxing vacation away from the kids. </s>
<s> would definitely return to the Ambassador next time we 're in the area ! I booked a hotel room for 4 nights at this hotel through an online vendor. </s>
<s> booking the hotel room I contacted the hotel to request a room with 2 beds. </s>
<s> was told in 3 different conversations with hotel personnel that I would have a room with 2 double beds. </s>
<s> I arrived I was given a King sized bed and was told that there was nothing the hotel could do for myself and my 3 guests. </s>
<s> the hotel management saw no problem with 4 people sleeping in 1 bed. </s>
<s> staff was completely unaccomodating. </s>
<s> add insult to injury we met other guests that had obtained a room with 2 beds by just walking in off the street the day after we checked in. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel to anyone. </s>
<s> customer service is well below what is acceptable. </s>
<s> location of the hotel is great but there are many other hotels that offer excellent service and high quality rooms to stay in while visiting Chicago. </s>
<s> line is do NOT stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker ! It has been a couple of years since I stayed here ; and got it for a night last weekend on Hotwire. </s>
<s> paid only $ 100 and stayed a Saturday night. </s>
<s> was very impressed with the redecorating done to the hotel. </s>
<s> lobby has always been great ; but the rooms were a little shabby in the past. </s>
<s> any more ; as the hotel has been redecorated in the last few years. </s>
<s> location is still amazing ; and with the Berghoff open again ; there is a great restaurant within walking distance. </s>
<s> room itself was fine and comfortable 'very peaceful ; but the customer service by the so-called ; concierge or " experience something or the others " left much to be desired. </s>
<s> ; I arrived and the doorman walked me to the desk. </s>
<s> was not greeted with the usual " Hello ; welcome to . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> " . </s>
<s> ; I got ; " Your name ? ID ? " No ; " hello " ; no " welcome to the Amalfi Hotel ; " just plain old poor customer service from the very beginning ! That left a very bad taste in my mouth ; but I decided to let it go and see how the rest of my stay was. </s>
<s> stayed this hotel for 2 nights. </s>
<s> had high hopes seeing as this is a 4 star hotel and seems quite elegant based on pictures I 've seen. </s>
<s> entering the building ; you can easily see that it is clean and high class. </s>
<s> lobby was nice ; and everything seemed as it should be. </s>
<s> ; as soon as I made it into my room ; it was completely different than everything previous to it. </s>
<s> was dirty ; visible yellow stains on the walls and all around the restroom. </s>
<s> room too was not completely organized as all other hotel rooms I 've been to. </s>
<s> was also a lingering smell from the last tenants. </s>
<s> I called the front desk about these issues ; they sent someone up to fix it. </s>
<s> left the hotel about two hours and upon returning ; they were still at it ! This is an unreasonable amount of time to fix these glaring errors. </s>
<s> smell also did not completely disappear when they were done. </s>
<s> I was too tired ; I just decided to deal with it for the rest of my stay here and focus on enjoying my vacation at Chicago instead. </s>
<s> hope its shallow exterior does not fool others like it fooled me. </s>
<s> spent three nights at the Amalfi Hotel ; while in Chicago on business. </s>
<s> a king-corner room and loved it. </s>
<s> room I 've ever had in a hotel in Chicago ; incredibly comfortable ; very clean. </s>
<s> breakfast and evening cocktails were a nice bonus too. </s>
<s> the location could n't be beat. </s>
<s> distance to the the River ; the Loop ; Michigan Ave shopping and convenient to public transportation. </s>
<s> noticed a number of reviews commented on the noise ; yes there is some street noise ; and the building across the street is under construction ' the noise from that was usually between 730-4 ; if you want to sleep late during the week ask for a room on the back side but really ; in downtown Chicago it 's not going to be silent ; if you want silence stay in the suburbs. </s>
<s> you want a great hotel ' at a great price right in the thick of everything ; stay at the Amalfi. </s>
<s> Hilton Chicago- We just back from our stay at the Hilton Chicago and I can not tell you just how much I wish we could have stayed there for another week at very least ! When we walked in the lobby my jaw dropped. </s>
<s> had looked at photos online but the pictures can not do the high vaulted ceilings and attention to detail that went into this breathtaking entryway. </s>
<s> husband and I were pleasantly surprised by the short line at check in and the nicest young man upgraded us to a lake view room with an utterly breathtaking view of lake Michigan. </s>
<s> rest of our stay was a whirlwind of convenient walks to Grant Park ; the Shedd Aquarium ; and Millenium park. </s>
<s> husband loved the workout facilities and our spacious room gave us a great home base from which to view Chicago. </s>
<s> staff could not have been nicer. </s>
<s> spent every night in Kitty O 'Sheas ; the Irish pub in the hotel. </s>
<s> have to recommend the corned beef which is by far the tastiest I have ever encountered. </s>
<s> an incredible trip ! One that we will always remember. </s>
<s> Hilton ! To start with ; this hotel had the worst customer service. </s>
<s> were impossible to work with on EVERYTHING ! Now ; the problems we had in chronological order. </s>
<s> ; we arrive at 8 PM Sat. </s>
<s> to check in. </s>
<s> did not have the room with 2 beds we had reserved available ; so they offered us a room with one bed and a rollaway ' free of charge. </s>
<s> ; the room was not ready yet. </s>
<s> at 10. </s>
<s> ! ' 2. </s>
<s> hrs later we were able to get our room keys. </s>
<s> ; there was no rollaway. </s>
<s> 30 mins and 3 phone calls later ; we had a rollaway ; but had to get the charge waived a second time. </s>
<s> we go to check out on Mon. </s>
<s> and they could n't print us a bill or give us a total. </s>
<s> stop 3 hrs down the road to get gas only to find out that our bank card had been overdrawn $ 2 ; 127. </s>
<s> ! We called the bank and found out the hotel had ran our card through 3 TIMES ; for $ 709 each ; when our bill was supposed to be $ 450. </s>
<s> sitting at the gas station on the phone for 1. </s>
<s> ; the money was finally put back in our account so we could continue our trip home. </s>
<s> would recommend a Holiday Inn over the Intercontinental any day. </s>
<s> is about the fourth time we stayed at the Allegro. </s>
<s> previous times ; I have nothing but good to say about the Allegro. </s>
<s> my reaction has soured on this place. </s>
<s> have stayed here the past few years on the first weekend in December as a kick off to the holiday season and our shopping. </s>
<s> the very start ; this year was a disappointment. </s>
<s> had checked the deals on a number of sites before calling the Allegro. </s>
<s> was quoted one price ' higher than what was on line ; when I mentioned this ; I was told I could have the lower price. </s>
<s> check in ; the desk was nice but not friendly. </s>
<s> discovered that our room was not as good as in the past ' punishment for asking for a lower price ? The closet had no hangers ; we had no place to put our suitcase. </s>
<s> one mentioned the wine reception in the evening. </s>
<s> the second day ; we discovered that even our bath mat for the shower was missing. </s>
<s> took two phone calls and almost two hours to get a new one. </s>
<s> wrote the management following our stay. </s>
<s> have yet to receive a reply. </s>
<s> to say we will be looking elsewhere when we go into the city the next time. </s>
<s> would advise others to do the same. </s>
<s> recently had my wedding at the Omni Hotel in Chicago and I was more than pleased. </s>
<s> decision to use a hotel as my wedding reception venue was at first a hard one ; I was worried that a hotel would be too impersonal but once I met with the staff at the Omni I was certain that it was the way to go. </s>
<s> staff was so attentive and friendly ; and I felt as if my wedding was the most important thing at the hotel. </s>
<s> highly recommend the Omni Hotel in Chicago ; brides will not be dissapointed ! I recently had the misfortune of staying at the Swissotel Chicago hotel in Illinois ; and it was one of the worse travel experiences I have ever had ! First off the shuttle that was suppose to pick us up at the air port was late by over an hour ! Then when the bus finally came ; the driver was nice enough but it was clearly his first day on the job since he got lost going back to the hotel. </s>
<s> when we got to the hotel they didn ; t seem to have our reservation for the 2nd room. </s>
<s> my wife and I stay in one room ; our teenage girls usually stay in their own room. </s>
<s> '
So after the very rude clerk at the corner did nothing to help us we were forced to pack into one room. </s>
<s> would have rented another room but they had no vacancies left. </s>
<s> hotel did have a large occupancy rate ; but that only slowed up everything else. </s>
<s> room service was late almost everytime we ordered ; and the hotel restaurant never had a wait less then 45 mins. </s>
<s> quality of the room was fair enough ; but it was almost impossible to get room service ; we could not get fresh towels for almost 2 days ! We were suppose to stay for a week ; we left after 4 days and found a different hotel to stay at. </s>
<s> would not recommend this place to anyone ! stay away ! I 'd been searching for a cool ; non-chain hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend. </s>
<s> thought I 'd found a winner in the Affinia . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
SOO disappointed ! In spite of the fact that our reservation was for two adults ; we arrived to find our room had a DOUBLE bed. </s>
<s> ? ! I was floored ; but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride ; was too tired to make a fuss. </s>
<s> were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night ; so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple. </s>
<s> was told that room service would call ME back to take my order . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and nothing happened. </s>
<s> did n't want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs. </s>
<s> special ; entree ; dessert and NAB for two still came out to $ . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> I am no hayseed ; I 'm WELL aware that everything costs more in Chicago ; but this just was n't worth it. </s>
<s> room was by the elevator w parking garage view . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the bathroom was tiny ; shower curtain was stained ; funky toilet seat 'lid ; and the vanity featured that " rude awakening " lighting normally found in low-rent dressing rooms ; i. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; " Holy crap ; have I looked that bad this whole time ? ! " If you 're a traveler who likes using the in-room coffeemaker ; they charge for their chintzy coffees ' I do n't use these ; but . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  come on. </s>
<s> enough ambience in the upstairs bar ; but weak drinks . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
That night ; our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms. </s>
<s> the Marathon was that weekend ; the hotel was so busy I did n't want to be a pest. </s>
<s> ca n't believe I was so impressed with this place online. </s>
<s> time I 'll happily pay more to stay someplace that 's actually a treat. </s>
<s> enjoyed our stay at the Swissotel in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> was elegant ; classy ; and the service was impeccable. </s>
<s> was very family friendly for us ; with the spacious rooms ; the kid 's room ; and the no smoking policy. </s>
<s> were just a short walk away from shopping and entertainment and the whole family enjoyed the virtual city tour that helped us decide what we wanted to see. </s>
<s> food was delicious and we did n't have to go outside the hotel to find good food. </s>
<s> visiting Chicago again ; we will come back. </s>
<s> was a luxurious experience at a reasonable price. </s>
<s> Davies The Sheraton is a fantastic hotel. </s>
<s> wife and I stayed on the 29th floor overlooking the Chicago River and Lake Michigan. </s>
<s> view was great. </s>
<s> got a corner room that also had a couch in. </s>
<s> hotel was just a short walk to the Navy Pier and the Magnificant Mile Shopping area. </s>
<s> at the hotel was great. </s>
<s> from checking in to maid service was first class. </s>
<s> Hotel ; Great Town ; Highly recommend it. </s>
<s> wife and I just spent 3 nights at The Talbott. </s>
<s> room was spacious ; comfortable and well-appointed. </s>
<s> hotel is quiet although there is some construction nearby. </s>
<s> and towels first-class. </s>
<s> Wi-Fi in the room. </s>
<s> location is terrific ; just one block to Michigan Avenue. </s>
<s> will stay here on future visits. </s>
<s> would not stay at this hotel again. </s>
<s> rooms had a fowl odor. </s>
<s> seemed as though the carpets have never been cleaned. </s>
<s> neighborhood was also less than desirable. </s>
<s> housekeepers seemed to be snooping around while they were cleaning the rooms. </s>
<s> will say that the front desk staff was friendly albeit slightly dimwitted. </s>
<s> ; I had very bad experience with this hotel ; as the rooms had bad smell and very dim light. </s>
<s> bed sheets were not properly cleaned. </s>
<s> the carpet was dirty though AC was working properly. </s>
<s> i would nor recommend this hotel to my friends as it did not satisfied me. </s>
<s> was a problem with hot and cold water in the bathroom. </s>
<s> do not go to this hotel ; it seems very nice from the pictures and all but in actual its different. </s>
<s> husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. </s>
<s> had contacted the customer service representative prior to our stay to request a quiet suite. </s>
<s> we arrived ; she greeted us and confirmed that we were getting exactly what I had requested -- and more. </s>
<s> suite had a partial view of the lake ! And ; we were able to check in early. </s>
<s> service at this hotel is incredible. </s>
<s> made us feel welcome and took care to respond to any question or request that we had. </s>
<s> suite was very quiet even though we were on the east side of the hotel ; very near to Michigan Avenue. </s>
<s> was prompt and thorough. </s>
<s> really could n't have asked for a better hotel. </s>
<s> will definitely stay there on future trips to Chicago and will recommend this hotel to anyone who travels there. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Sofitel Hotel ' Chicago Water Tower ; and I was quite disappointed. </s>
<s> was excited by the great location ' on East Chestnut Street downtown ; but this was a mediocre hotel for the price $ 250 per night before taxes. </s>
<s> view from my room was of the top of a parking garage and some dumpsters ; and yes ; the view of downtown in the distance was pretty ; but I was very disappointed. </s>
<s> bedding seemed to be polyester ; not the luxury cotton many lower-level hotels are featuring lately. </s>
<s> I ordered room service at 10 : 30 ' on a Thursday night ; I had to wait for 55 minutes ; 20 minutes longer than I was quoted. </s>
<s> ordered a salad ; and I thought the lettuce was a bit limp as if it had been sitting out for too long. </s>
<s> ; I was very disappointed by my overpriced stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. </s>
<s> enjoyed a pleasant 2 night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago ; Il. </s>
<s> hotel was beautiful ; inside and out. </s>
<s> felt as if I was a celebrity staying there. </s>
<s> staff was especially kind and very professional. </s>
<s> husband and I have never felt more comfortable. </s>
<s> was very pleased that they had transportation for us ; since we flew in to Chicago for our anniversary. </s>
<s> Shedd Aquarium package was an excellent bonus. </s>
<s> highly recommend this hotel to everyone that 's going to be visiting Chicago ! My wife and I stayed here and had a terrible experience. </s>
<s> messing up our reservations ; the staff decided to blame us for the mistake. </s>
<s> manager was extremely rude and highly incompetent ; and assigned us to a one-bedroom room after claiming that no more two-bedroom rooms were available. </s>
<s> away from this hotel unless you want to have a terrible experience. </s>
<s> got married in the Chicago area this passed weeknd and my guests all stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel. </s>
<s> had nothing but nice things to say about it ! My husbands mother is terribly picky about where she stays and this hotel met her needs. </s>
<s> rooms are decorated so nicely and they do n't have that funny hotel smell. </s>
<s> Pump Room was a fun place for the men to hang and watch sports. </s>
<s> I 'm ever in the area again I will be sure to book a room at the Ambassador East Hotel ! I selected the Talbott after 3 hrs comparing hotels online. </s>
<s> have had wonderful experiences with boutiques ' Monaco ; Allegro and assumed this would be comparable. </s>
<s> points : the lobby is beautiful ; and one staff member took roses I bought for my wife and arranged them nicely. </s>
<s> many problems : When my wife called with a question on our arrival day ; the agent could find no reservation -- 15 mins later she was transferred to another person who found the record instantly. </s>
<s> we arrived ; the lobby was stuffed with students ; nobody tried to manage the group ; several of whom pushed ahead to the check-in desk. </s>
<s> left our bags and went out for 2 hrs so we could check in with less hassle. </s>
<s> finally were checked in ; after waiting 15 mins while the confused desk clerk searched for rooms. </s>
<s> we got there ; our room had not been made up from the last guest. </s>
<s> we complained ; we were given an " upgrade " to a room that was old and uninspired. </s>
<s> are scuffed ; closet shelves are bowed ; the air conditioner is noisy ; and a wall lamp is loose. </s>
<s> view is of a construction site. </s>
<s> are dated. </s>
<s> expect this from a budget hotel ; not one positioning itself as elegant and upscale. </s>
<s> we returned after an evening out ; the card reader to open the main doors did not work. </s>
<s> staff member admonished us ' really for not using the reader ; when in fact we had tried. </s>
<s> was embarrassing ; as others were standing in the lobby. </s>
<s> tried to access the hotel 's wifi network ; but was only given a $ 9. </s>
<s> upgrade option. </s>
<s> called the desk ; and was told to " click past it " ; which of course did nothing. </s>
<s> was n't until 2 hrs later the complimentary access worked. </s>
<s> are pretty easygoing ; we love good treatment and tip handsomely. </s>
<s> we had only 1or 2 problems ; we would n't write. </s>
<s> fact ; we would not have written except the hotel did not make things right. </s>
<s> president wrote a letter ; and suggested others at the hotel would be in touch . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nobody ever was. </s>
<s> will never stay here again. </s>
<s> was lured in by the hotel 's pictures showing a fabulous suite. </s>
<s> I arrived to find cheap furniture that smelled of old cheese. </s>
<s> called the front desk to see if there was another room available. </s>
<s> was put on hold for five minutes and no one came back on the line. </s>
<s> ended up going to the front desk myself. </s>
<s> was ignored and not given assistance until I interrupted the front desk clerk who seemed to be on a personal call. </s>
<s> clerk apologize but then looked at me with an attitude when I requested another room because mine smelled like old cheese. </s>
<s> was informed that there were no other rooms available but that they would send up housekeeping. </s>
<s> sprayed some Febreeze on the couch and then left. </s>
<s> tried to relax by turning on the TV in the bedroom. </s>
<s> sat on the bed and saw something scurry under the pillow. </s>
<s> checked the corner of the mattress and found bedbugs. </s>
<s> packed up my bags and left after that. </s>
<s> did get a refund on the room after some complaining. </s>
<s> went across town to the Marriott where I had a much better stay. </s>
<s> just off the beaten path and about two blocks from the river the Fairmont Chicago offers an excellent location to operate as home base for your trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> staff were friendly and helpful ; arranging many of the sightseeing events we enjoyed while in the city. </s>
<s> are many attractions withiin easy walking distance ' The Art Institute is a must see and Millenium Park is a fun visit. </s>
<s> architectural tour by river departs a dock that is very close to the Fairmont and there are lots of restaurants nearby. </s>
<s> rooms were excellent and the club room is worth the extra expense. </s>
<s> would definitely stay here again. </s>
<s> Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown is a wonderful hotel. </s>
<s> hotel is very elegant ; classy and only offers the best. </s>
<s> hotel offers complimentary breakfast ; along with delicious meals and wines in the afternoons. </s>
<s> suites are very real designed and has a very upscale look. </s>
<s> wonderfully cozy yet graceful hotel leaves you with an experience of a lifeltime. </s>
<s> would recommend this awesome hotel to anyone that was looking for beautiful ; yet comfortable hotel experience. </s>
<s> disappointed in our stay in Chicago Monoco. </s>
<s> have stayed many times elsewhere ; primarily in washington DC and are accustomed to great customer service ; beverages like water or soda at the wine bar ; coffee and papers in the morning ; help with bags. </s>
<s> only did the Chicago monoco do none of these things ; the staff was not helpful ; either. </s>
<s> were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there. </s>
<s> got the feeling you were " bothering " people if you asked a question. </s>
<s> bellman ; the doorman did not open the door or help with bags. </s>
<s> though we were traveling with a child ; I had to request a fish when they did not bring it. </s>
<s> baffling . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  as we love the Monoco in Washington. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed at this hotel the weekend of Sept. </s>
<s> 17-18 ; 2011. </s>
<s> we were planning our vacation ; we were impressed with the hotel. </s>
<s> exterior is very lovely and we looked forward to enjoying the view from our room. </s>
<s> first started to wonder if we 'd made the right choice when there was no one waiting to help us with our bags. </s>
<s> had to carry our luggage up to our room ourselves as the hotel was in the middle of a shift change. </s>
<s> seems like something a supposedly " world class " hotel should be able to avoid. </s>
<s> good : Our room did have a nice view and when I sat down on the bed it was like sitting on a cloud. </s>
<s> shower was very pleasant. </s>
<s> bad : The room was very small and the bed was not the King size we had requested. </s>
<s> felt very cramped and uncomfortable throughout our stay. </s>
<s> have stayed at less luxurious hotels that were much more spacious and able to provide us with the requested size bed. </s>
<s> restaurant options were acceptable ; although the service was not as excellent as described. </s>
<s> we expected a miracle that would 've changed our minds about the hotel. </s>
<s> were so disappointed by the room and the service at check-in the rest of the weekend was somewhat tainted. </s>
<s> usually enjoy partaking of room service ; but we decided after a sub par first day we would eat out for the rest of the weekend. </s>
<s> time ; we will look into other hotels in the Chicago area. </s>
<s> stayed at the InterContinental Chicago Magnificent Mile and was a little underwhelmed. </s>
<s> 's convenient location did not compensate for the fact that the property is very old and definitely in need of some updating and renovating. </s>
<s> is a definite need for some noise control -- everything and everybody could be heard from inside the room. </s>
<s> the plumbing from other guests rooms was particularly annoying. </s>
<s> fitness facilities are really hyped but unfortunately they were not free to use ' at least it was n't included with my booking choice. </s>
<s> was pretty expensive so if you really do n't need it ; do n't use it. </s>
<s> ; just dissappointed that the great location was n't matched with great accommodations. </s>
<s> arrived to find that my room was not ready ; despite it being past the 3pm check in time. </s>
<s> was not offered any compensation for this ; or any real apology ; just shunted off to the side to wait it out. </s>
<s> took a good hour and a half ; during which time I was needing to be reading for a meeting. </s>
<s> ; no apologies ; just my card. </s>
<s> room was adequately clean ' it had better be . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> '
though sparsely furnished for the price. </s>

<s> to me like a regular motel inn but I paid way more than I would have at an actual motel inn. </s>
<s> did not appreciate that none of the electrical outlets worked and my phone was dead for my whole duration of the trip. </s>
<s> would not recommend this Hotel to anyone. </s>
<s> was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel ; after hearing all the good things about it. </s>
<s> ; it was a very underwhelming experience ; to say the least. </s>
<s> let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel. </s>
<s> off ; it is located my favorite part of Chicago - the leafy ; affluent part of town that is Chicago 's equivalent of Manhattan 's Upper East Side ; complete with sidewalks ; quiet tree-lined streets ; real old-school townhouses ' instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums ; cute boutiques ' instead of Gap ; Banana Republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands and ; of course ; Hermes of Paris ' which warrants a separate mention. </s>
<s> also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches ; cherry colored wooden furnitures ; area rugs and distinct artwork. </s>
<s> very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains. </s>
<s> definitely love the room. </s>
<s> the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan ; getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task. </s>
<s> we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous ; ample bathroom ; double sink ; massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around ; do a chicken dance ; and strut my Herve and Louboutins in. </s>
<s> only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room ; but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us ; so ca n't have it all ! Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service ; or lack thereof. </s>
<s> mean ; seriously. </s>
<s> do n't call it the ' hospitality industry for no reason. </s>
<s> did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say ; a 3000-room Vegas hotel. </s>
<s> ; I called in to reconfirm my reservation. </s>
<s> lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent. </s>
<s> off ; she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff ; to whom I had to explain myself all over again ' my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service. </s>
<s> person who manned the reception desk was not friendly ; nor was he at all competent either. </s>
<s> in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in ; which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there. </s>
<s> the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1AM. </s>
<s> a general rule ; I am never ; ever ; a big fan of room service ; having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18 % gratuity ; 10. </s>
<s> % tax ' and still expect a tip on during my days globetrotting on the company 's expense account. </s>
<s> overcooked steaks ; lukewarm soup ; bread hard enough to knock someone out ; and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite. </s>
<s> I really was n't expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24-hour room service ; but lo and behold ; they do. </s>
<s> placed an order of chicken BLT ; which ' to my initial delight came in within 20 minutes. </s>
<s> after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $ 2 on top of the 18 % service fee ' refer above I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin ; microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lay 's chips ' lightly salted flavor. </s>
<s> bread looked like someone stomped on it ; the L and T looked like it was 2 days old ; the B was unrecognizable ; and the chicken was burnt and cold. </s>
<s> was pathetic room service at its finest. </s>
<s> did get the item taken off our bill ' rightfully so too but the front desk person was ; instead of apologetic ; defiant. </s>
<s> whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving ; it 's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. </s>
<s> wo n't be coming back ; unfortunately. </s>
<s> was completely unfamiliar with Chicago but needed a place to stay while my husband worked there for a few days and we picked the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based solely on their internet site. </s>
<s> did I get lucky ! This is a beautiful hotel with all of amenities I could have hoped for ; terrific food ; and within walking distance of several interesting places ; including the Art Institute of Chicago. </s>
<s> ; at the concierge desk ; was particularly helpful at guiding a Chicago newbie to the best places to eat ands to see. </s>
<s> will heartily recommend the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. </s>
<s> had to go down to Chicago one weekend for the graduation ceremony of my cousin. </s>
<s> was a sudden trip and I did n't even have the time to book a hotel before hand. </s>
<s> I showed up in Chicago and asked my taxi driver to take me to the nearest good hotel ; he took me to Omni Chicago Hotel. </s>
<s> was impressed with how clean it was and they did n't have a problem with getting me a room even though I did n't have a reservation. </s>
<s> staff was friendly to me the entire time I was in the hotel ; which was just a short two nights ; and the cleaning service was top notch. </s>
<s> Amalfi Hotel has become my absolute favorite place to stay when I visit Chicago. </s>
<s> place really knows how to treat their guests. </s>
<s> serve a complimentary breakfast on every floor and even have iPod docking stations in the room ! If you want to watch a movie you can just borrow it from their collection. </s>
<s> took advantage of the free wi-fi AND the plush bathrobes. </s>
<s> I stayed there I had to try the spa services that were offered. </s>
<s> experience ! The staff really made me feel comfortable during my stay and I will definitely be staying there again on my next trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> Hard Rock hotel is great for a relaxing getaway. </s>
<s> rooms are quiet ; the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is a nice size. </s>
<s> had fabulous service and got a great rate. </s>
<s> than the fact that there were no bathrobes ' it 's listed as an amenity and the Sony radio did n't work ; it was perfect. </s>
<s> definitely stay there again ! I chose this hotel for a nice weekend getaway and was nothing but disappointed. </s>
<s> previous weekend ; I stayed at a 2. </s>
<s> star hotel a few blocks away ; and was much more impressed there. </s>
<s> Hard Rock had a number of issues including : very dark room - not much light ' artificial or natural ; lots of street noise ; very cheap decor and furniture ; broken cabinet door ; very warm room - said they would send maintenance ; but they never arrived ; had bar charges on account that were not ours. </s>
<s> ; I was very surprised that this was a 4 star hotel. </s>
<s> expected a much better experience ! Sofitel Chicago Water Tower - We had a great stay at Sofitel during our family trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> location was simply great. </s>
<s> in downtown Chicago ; it was very convenient to shops ; restaurants ; and subway stations. </s>
<s> rooms were a good size and very clean. </s>
<s> it was kind of on the pricey side ; for the location and the comfortable stay ; we really could n't complain. </s>
<s> would be happy to return next time I 'm in Chicago ! Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park - Here 's what you do n't want to hear when you walk into a Fairmont hotel at 11 : 00pm after a 10-hour flight : " I 'm sorry ; Ma 'am ; the hotel is overbooked. </s>
<s> only rooms we still have available are in the smoking section. </s>
<s> " 
Because apparently what a confirmed reservation and $ 300 'night will get you is blank stares and an " I 'm sorry ; Ma 'am ; that 's the best we can do at the moment. </s>
<s> " . </s>
<s> I took the room because I was so tired that all I wanted was to sink into a bed and deal with this in the morning. </s>
<s> ; I should have just gone to a different hotel because not only did the whole floor ; including my room ; reek so bad that I got an immediate headache ; but the room itself was so dingy that I can not understand how they manage to keep their prices up. </s>
<s> carpet looked so old and gross that I decided to keep my shoes on just to be safe. </s>
<s> furnishings look like they came out of my grandma 's attic. </s>
<s> layout is so weird that every time you go to the bathroom you have to be careful not to walk right into a table corner. </s>
<s> bathroom is small and cramped ; with a perfectly placed mirror to let you stare at yourself while sitting on the toilet. </s>
<s> tap was perfect for having water splashed all over yourself while you 're brushing your teeth. </s>
<s> for when you want to take a shower ; because the shower itself WAS NOT WORKING ! Huh ; you 'd think this is something SOMEONE would have taken note of ; especially the cleaning staff if they really DID clean the shower after the previous customer ; which I now suspect they hadn 't. </s>
<s> called downstairs and a surly concierge condescended to give me a room where at least the shower worked ' though still in the smoking section ; of course. </s>
<s> the time I finally managed to fall asleep it was 4am and the cleaning staff promptly knocked on my door at 8am and waltzed right in ! I was so taken aback with the lack of professionalism ' and common sense ! of the staff ; the irresponsible overbooking from the management ; and the state of the rooms themselves that I will not be stopping here again. </s>
<s> worth the price. </s>
<s> almost stayed at a hotel for $ 110 a night ; but instead choose the Hard Rock for $ 180 ' a special. </s>
<s> were located on the " newly renovated " Beatles floor. </s>
<s> carpets in the hallways looked like they needed to be replaced. </s>
<s> entering our room we found some cool Beatles artwork along with a 3x4 foot Marilyn Manson portrait. </s>
<s> think they were halfway done re theming the room. </s>
<s> checkout they tried to charge us $ 11 for using the mini-bar which we did n't even open. </s>
<s> removed the charge right away but I wonder if they try to get unsuspecting people with that charge. </s>
<s> special here. </s>
<s> you want to pay a bunch extra for some light theming then this is the place for you. </s>

<s> 've stayed at the HRH in Orlando twice and are blown away by the ambience there. </s>
<s> 's not that way here. </s>
<s> may be all ticky tacky things ; but they added up to us. </s>
<s> of all ; the room. </s>
<s> upgraded our reservation thru the HRH website for a room with " an Incredible view " . </s>
<s> ; our 9th floor view was of nothing more than the venting on top of the building next to us. </s>
<s> was all we could see. </s>
<s> there was no view. </s>
<s> room was muggy. </s>
<s> had the air turned down all the way and it never got below 74. </s>
<s> woke up sweaty both days. </s>
<s> we opened the window to get a breeze ; the noise from the rooftop next to us was overbearing. </s>
<s> room was small and dark ; but it did n't bother us that much. </s>
<s> bed may have been the mosr comfortable bed I ever slept in. </s>
<s> we even joked about stealing the pillows ! We had the same issue with the honor bar as a previous poster ; but they removed the charges no prob. </s>
<s> the entire hotel ; I counted a total of 3 pieces of music memorabilia. </s>
<s> thought it was a pretty cheesy attempt to renovate an old hotel ; throw a Styx guitar on the wall ; and slap a HRH emblem on the outside. </s>
<s> hotel itself was very clean and did not look like a renovation. </s>
<s> location is good ; right on the south end of the mag mile ; but there are 10-15 better hotels in a better location to shopping ; quality eats ; and Navy Pier. </s>
<s> you have a car ; parking will cost you $ 38 'day ; which is prob normal for downtown. </s>
<s> hotel restaurant was a Chinese restaurant. </s>
<s> bar was small and trendy ; and I guess the kicker to it all was that my wife tried to order a Pina Colada and they told us they did n't have a blender. </s>
<s> ? ? ? ? A HRH without a blender ? Did they not know that Jimmy Buffet was in town ? ? ? ? Mind blowing ! I would never ; never ; never go back here. </s>
<s> I said ; there are many better hotels in much better locations. </s>
<s> will stay at the HRH in Orlando or elsewhere again. </s>
<s> about this had reservation confirmation in hand and still had to argue with the registration desk about price on reservation. </s>
<s> tried to charge me price on bill they slide under your door. </s>
<s> not on my watch ! Then about this room you gave me I understand this place is old but for the price you charge how about some indoor plumbing ! You take a shower and the tub fills with water will not drain this is absolutely redickulas for this being a Hilton I think you should step back and take a look at how this place is operating. </s>
<s> : Fail Parking price : Fail Plumbing : Fail Thank you Hilton for for my super 8 experience in Chicago. </s>

All the reviews sounded great so I feel awkward writing this ; but I have to be fair - this place was a major disappointment. </s>
<s> the location is superb ; the images online must have been taken over 10 years ago because all of the decor when we visited looked very old and faded. </s>
<s> noticed dirt everywhere - the fabric on the furniture was stained ; the baseboards and woodwork were scratched and dirty and there seemed to be a smell of mold and mildew that permeated the entire hotel. </s>
<s> though the food was great ; the linens ; glassware and silverware were not sparkling - it sort of helped that candles were lit so I did n't focus too much on how dreary and washed out the dining facility was. </s>

<s> we missed the wine hour. </s>
<s> thing that realy impressed me is that b 'c of flight delays we got to Chicago a day late -- Hotel Monaco manager waived the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a guaranteed reservation. </s>
<s> hotel is trading on the Hilton name and although adequate the decor is dated and depressing. </s>
<s> classed as a three star the prices do not reflect this. </s>
<s> was more expensive than other four star hotels in the neighbourhood ; The breakfast is poor quality and the room very crowded. </s>

<s> bed and floors were dirty ; and the shower leaked water everywhere because of a broken pipe. </s>
<s> would not stay at the James again ; especially not at the price. </s>
<s> my goodness ; this has got to be one of the worst places to stay in all of downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> all went well enough checking in ; but them went downhill. </s>
<s> was so much left to be desired. </s>
<s> biggest problem was a huge turd in the toilet ; I kid you not ! I guess the maid was rather busy that day or took a break and forgot about it ; I just do n't know. </s>
<s> for the prices they charge ; this type of thing is unacceptable. </s>
<s> everything else about the actual room was as expected. </s>
<s> noise was a bit more than I 'm used to though ; but there was a convention of college age kids staying on the floor above us. </s>
<s> we asked to be moved to another room ; they did get us in another room ; but that took nearly 2 hours. </s>
<s> second room worked out well for us ; but I wo n't be risking staying here again. </s>
<s> the pool was not available ; I really wish they would have mentioned that on their website ; I was looking forward to it for days. </s>
<s> in all ; it is a beautiful place in a wonderful location ; but they need to work on their customer service before I 'll reconsider staying at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown. </s>
<s> family of four went to a convention and stayed here in early August. </s>
<s> were promised a room with two double beds. </s>
<s> we arrived ' earlier than most we were told they were 45 double beds short. </s>
<s> reluctantly agreed to take a room with a king bed and a promise of a roll away bed. </s>
<s> had a to sleep very uncomfortably with a 12 year old in our bed and our other child in the roll away. </s>
<s> did we know we were being CHARGED a daily fee for this bed. </s>
<s> managment could not handle the large group that was at this hotel. </s>
<s> bellhops and bartenders were visibly stressed and we did not have towels one day until very late at night. </s>
<s> managers would not take off the roll away bed charge and were not the least bit accomodating. </s>
<s> were so disappointed in this hotel. </s>
<s> ; they do not have a pool here. </s>
<s> you want to use a pool there is a health club next to the hotel but you have to pay $ 20 a day to use it. </s>
<s> 80 for a family to take a little swim was a bit ridiculous. </s>
<s> yourself a favor ; if you want to be accomodated and are thinking of booking this hotel for a convention or otherwise ; go elsewhere. </s>
<s> has too many hotels to choose from to pick this one. </s>
<s> never heard back from managment on this issue when I called and emailed so obviously they do n't care ; even when I told them I 'd write a review on this website. </s>
<s> is an awesome city though. </s>
<s> loved it ! First of all ; Expedia. </s>
<s> charged me for an additional person per my instructions but when I arrived at the Hotel these monies were not included and the complimentary breakfast was not offered. </s>
<s> Hotel service person who checked us in forgot to give me back my parking ticket but left a generic message for me stating that there was an envelope at the front desk. </s>
<s> had to wait in line for another 20 minutes to discover this the whole time this person was looking at me and never said a word ! I was charged and paid for parking adjacent to the Hotel. </s>
<s> we went to leave the gate would not open. </s>
<s> had to find the parking garage office and the Manager had to call several times over to the Hotel until finally someone picked up. </s>
<s> confirmed my payment and then we were allowed to leave the structure. </s>
<s> Hotel itself is beautiful ! The bell hops and doormen were just wonderful. </s>
<s> were more than helpful and gracious but the internal staff were rude and not helpful at all ! I recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago while on a business trip. </s>
<s> have to say that I was very displeased with the service i received during my stay. </s>
<s> though their website boasts that their staff will be at your beck and call ; i found them to be very rude. </s>
<s> beds were extremely uncomfortable and the noise level very high. </s>
<s> was awakened by guests in the next room several times. </s>
<s> though I complained to the front desk ; they did not resolve the issue. </s>
<s> definitely would not recommend this hotel and I will be staying at a different hotel if I am in the area again. </s>
<s> wife and I spent several nights here on a getaway excursion. </s>
<s> did n't choose it -- Priceline gave it to me for $ 70. </s>
<s> I 'd paid the book rate ; $ 175 ; I 'd have been less pleased. </s>
<s> troubles with checkin. </s>
<s> small room but bed was clean and comfortable. </s>
<s> in the lobby was a godsend. </s>
<s> 'd read horror stories about the staff but they seemed friendly enough. </s>
<s> $ 70 ; it 's a steal. </s>
<s> its online face value ; not so much. </s>
<s> definitely return if can get similar price. </s>
<s> experience as Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was horrible. </s>
<s> and my wife were on a road trip from New York and stopped had reservations for Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel. </s>
<s> arrived at 12 : 00 AM and they did not have a non-smoking room available for which we booked ! My wife was pregnant at the time and the reception staff had no sympathy. </s>
<s> wife could n't handle the smell of the room so I asked for a refund to go stay somewhere else. </s>
<s> refused and were very rude and unhelpful. </s>
<s> had to stay the night ; and the first thing next morning we did was leave and look for a different hotel. </s>
<s> will never stay at this hotel again. </s>
<s> Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was supposed to be our romantic get away and it turned into a nightmare ! When we got there our room was n't done ! We were not offered anything to do ; drink or eat in the meantime and we had to wait well over the 20 minutes that they said it would be finished. </s>
<s> clerk at the front desk twas texting on her cell phone ! How rude ! We were totally on time and the manager said that they would take care of the issue and upgrade our room but it was not done. </s>
<s> after waiting that long for the room ; can you believe it ? There was a dirty towel in the bathroom. </s>
<s> television did n't work ; we had to wait on a repair guy to fix it. </s>
<s> ; the hotel failed to mention there was a convention that was going on and the spa was under repair. </s>
<s> 'm so mad I 'm writing the owners and letting them know ! This really made me mad. </s>
<s> have n't taken a vacation in years and I was expecting the Fairmont to be luxurious and cater to our needs. </s>
<s> the concierge snickered at my boots ; so what ; I like to wear Doc Martens ! It makes me mad even thinking about the Fairmont. </s>
<s> least my time in Chicago was enjoyable even though our hotel was more than lame. </s>
<s> 's a little late ; but . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
My husband I first stayed at the Amalfi in 8 '06 totally based on reviews I read on this website. </s>
<s> were totally WOWED ! Loved the location ; the room ; the Aveda bath products ; but most of all loved the evening reception breakfast on our floor. </s>
<s> returned to Chicago with 3 girlfriends in 9 '07 and booked us in a suite at the Amalfi. </s>
<s> was great - room was very spacious and my girlfriends were quite pleased ! Will stay next time I 'm in Chicago too ! P. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> honor a government rate ! I stayed at the Fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent. </s>
<s> was given a very large room with great views of the city ; the breakfast was extremely good ; and the location was as central as I could have wished for. </s>
<s> pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning swims. </s>
<s> the evening I spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too. </s>
<s> recommended as a base for exploring Chicago. </s>
<s> was the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in ! The room and bathroom were quite large for downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> pool and hot tub were also very nice. </s>
<s> would definately recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> did n't hear any noise in our room from other guests or from the city. </s>
<s> is in a great location - walking distance to Millenium Park ; the Loop and Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> James Chicago-A good hotel with friendly and cooperative staff. </s>
<s> is in a prime location near many tourist attractions and restaurants. </s>
<s> room design was modern and welcoming. </s>
<s> I was disappointed to find that the shower took a long time to heat up and that the wifi access was extremely slow. </s>
<s> ; the TV only had a few channels and had fuzzy connection. </s>
<s> the bed was comfortable ; I was annoyed by the street noise at night ; thin room walls ; and the small closet space. </s>
<s> was disheartened by the quality of the James. </s>
<s> can I say . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  this USED to be our FAVORITE hotel in Chicago because of its location ; its historic and gorgeous pool ; it amazing Sunday brunch ; it 's relatively low price compared to comparable hotels ; its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
All of the above has fallen disappointingly by the wayside with a resounding THUD. </s>
<s> 's break it down : Location : I 'll concede that it 's still great. </s>
<s> a corner room in the Historic tower higher than the 20th floor with a view of Michigan Ave and 'or the river. </s>
<s> historic and gorgeous pool : Closed indefinitely ! When asked when it will re-open ; the hotel staff actually said ; " Maybe never. </s>
<s> " 
Its amazing Sunday brunch : Zest is gone ; and his been replaced by a very dark Michael Jordan restaurant that takes up much of the lobby and second entrance. </s>
<s> The lobby ; by the way ; used to be beautiful and open with lots of places to sit. </s>
<s> no longer . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
The food is very bad. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> are so many restaurants in this city. </s>
<s> yourself a favor and go somewhere else to eat. </s>
<s> relatively low price compared to comparable hotels : Based on my review of everything else. </s>
<s> to the Drake ; or the Peninsula. </s>
<s> worth the extra money . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
That ; or downgrade to the Hilton and get what you expect and pay for . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
The InterContinental has fallen so low that you pay a higher price than the Hilton ; but you get a worse experience ! Its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership : I canceled our membership after this disaster. </s>
<s> of the membership includes early check-in ' granted ; when available . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  but our room was n't ready until 6pm. </s>
<s> is obviously after normal check-in. </s>
<s> staff was overwhelmed ; and not effective or helpful. </s>
<s> tried to speak with the manager about our room ; waited in long line to speak with someone ; only to be told that my husband needed to be with me because the membership was in his name. </s>
<s> a nutshell. </s>
<s> somewhere else. </s>
<s> : Go to Argo tea next door instead of the Starbucks in the hotel. </s>
<s> better food and coffee. </s>
<s> Omni Chicago Hotel was in one word ; dreadful. </s>
<s> hotel is in the heart of the city and traffic is chaotic. </s>
<s> service is terrible. </s>
<s> you want to wait for your room for 3 and a half hours this is the place to go ! Throughout a whole week ; beds are made once and bathrooms are never cleaned. </s>
<s> hotel is no help when looking for a nice place to dine or a fun place to visit ; they give no info for any activities going on in Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel should be listed in the top 10 WORST hotels in America. </s>
<s> not waste your time nor money staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel. </s>
<s> my sister got married last summer ; our stay at the Sheraton Hotel was delightful ! Billy and the kids and I were exhausted after the long flight from San Francisco ; so it 's a good thing that we found the perfect place to relax ! The kids ADORED the indoor pool ; Billy could n't stop talking about the beautiful jogging path ; and I even pampered myself by taking advantage of the massage therapy before the big day. </s>
<s> reception dinner at Shula 's Steakhouse was fun and delicious. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend this hotel to any one who is in Chicago for an extended visit ! Got a good deal on a weekend pacage in this Hotel and have to say it is the nicest stay I have had in more than a dozen business trips to Chicago. </s>
<s> rooms are Suites ; staff is friendly and professional ; Restaurant is out of this world and all the extras like a great health club ; turn down service ; complimentary morning beverages delivered to room and on and on. </s>
<s> was very clean and every need was attended to without feeling intruded on. </s>
<s> definately stay here again. </s>
<s> Rock Hotel - I had the worst experience checking into the hotel ; the staff was rude and the first room I stayed at smelled heavily of smoke. </s>
<s> had specifically requested a non-smoking room ; but they must have missed this. </s>
<s> quality was typical - everything you would expect and nothing special. </s>
<s> linnen sheets were too thin and felt like low quality. </s>
<s> biggest complaint was the noise - it was simply intollerable ! My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago this past summer. </s>
<s> to say we will not be returning ! The Hotel is very overpriced for what you get. </s>
<s> arriving to the hotel the staff was very unfriendly and could not help with questions we had. </s>
<s> bed was very uncomfortable and the " fully-stocked honor bar " was stocked with only a few choices. </s>
<s> shower did not even work !We booked the King Suite with Jacuzzi but ended up only getting a king room with no jacuzzi. </s>
<s> would not recommend this place ! Swissotel Chicago - I just returned from a stay at the Swissotel Chicago and I have to say I was underwhelmed. </s>
<s> had heard great things The Palm from friends ; but the several times that I went there I was greeted with terrible service and lackluster food at best. </s>
<s> checking into my room ; the mini-refrigerator was not functioning properly ; so I called down to the front desk ; the staff could not seem any less interested in helping me if they tried ! Overall a very negative experience ; I would not stay here again. </s>
<s> was very happy with my stay at the Knickerbocker. </s>
<s> room were nice ; and the staff was excellent. </s>
<s> was able to stay here for $ 80 per night thru Priceline. </s>
<s> was an incredible bargain in my opinion . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  this hotel is very nice. </s>
<s> has an excellent location . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  just off of Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> of the best shopping in Chicago can be found right around the corner. </s>
<s> 's a great location . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  very close to many great attractions. </s>
<s> there is any negative it would be that there is no swimming pool ; but I think that is common with a lot of the older hotels in Chicago ; I would definately recommend this place . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  hopefully I will be able to stay there again in the future. </s>
<s> is an absolutely gorgeous hotel. </s>
<s> had an amazing view of the city ; especially at night. </s>
<s> room was luxurious with extremely comfortable beds. </s>
<s> was a desk and chair ; large bathroom ; comfortable chair and reading lamp. </s>
<s> was also an area for snacks and a coffee maker ; that included Starbucks coffee. </s>
<s> would definitely come back again ! This hotel was very beautiful. </s>
<s> went with a group of 4 friends and we had a blast. </s>
<s> was very centrally located and was close to all sorts of transportation. </s>
<s> Continental breakfast was magnificent ! I did n't see much of the staff but all of the men at the front door were extremely helpful. </s>
<s> at this hotel was one of the high points of a last minute ; budget Valentines weekend trip for my husband and me. </s>
<s> got a great rate -- $ 70 -- on Priceline. </s>
<s> to the subway ' red line and we got from O 'Hare to the hotel in less than an hour for $ 3. </s>
<s> for both of us. </s>
<s> were able to check in more than 4 hours early. </s>
<s> was great -- very clean ; good closet space and fantastic bedding. </s>
<s> one expensive drink at the Irish bar ; but the bartender 's advice on restaurants and clubs to check out made it worth the price. </s>
<s> was helpful ; too. </s>
<s> ; service was terrific ; room was great and staying there was a treat. </s>
<s> would stay there again any time ; especially at that price. </s>
<s> Chicago Magnificent Mile - I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here ! My son has allergies ; so the option of their PURE room was really convenient and our room was very spacious. </s>
<s> staff was courteous and accommodating ; they even provided ice pops for the kids when it was unseasonably hot one day. </s>
<s> were on the 20th floor ; so we did n't hear much street noise either. </s>
<s> one complaint was that the website did n't mention that the swimming pool was under construction for the whole summer ; I intended to make use of the facility and was disappointed that I couldn 't. </s>
<s> I made my reservations at Softiel in Chicago ; I was expecting the ultimate in Luxury but Softiel failed to deliver. </s>
<s> was just ok. </s>
<s> do not spend money on a quality hotel for " just ok " . </s>
<s> I want " just ok " I 'll check into the Days Inn ! First of all there were problems with our reservation. </s>
<s> asked to have a room near the top floors and my room was actually only on the fifth floor ! The desk clerk was less than helpful to fix this. </s>
<s> eventually got it fixed but I certainly did not feel at all like a valued guest during this process. </s>
<s> when I went down to ask for directions and information at the desk the clerk was very cold and abrupt with us. </s>
<s> room was quite nice but the shower did not deliver adequate water pressure. </s>
<s> the second day of our stay ; housekeeping did not refill our soaps or coffee. </s>
<s> also failed to empty one of our wastebaskets. </s>
<s> I know ; but when you 're paying for a luxury experience ; you kind of expect luxury ! The hotel itself was nice but the staff really do n't deliver. </s>
<s> would not stay here again. </s>
<s> can get a nice clean room at LaQuinta for 1 '4 the price and the staff is much more helpful. </s>
<s> loved the Talbott. </s>
<s> location was fabulous . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> very close to the shopping. </s>
<s> hotel is smaller ; but the rooms are very nice. </s>
<s> are very spacious and are able to be darkened to sleep well. </s>
<s> ; the beds are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. </s>
<s> might also add that our room at queen beds. </s>
<s> staff is all friendly and puts them themselves out for you. </s>
<s> hotel has a cute outdoor eating area on the sidewalk that has flowers ; etc. </s>
<s> looks like a scene out of Europe. </s>
<s> would highly recommend the hotel. </s>
<s> were there with our daughters ; ages 10 and 13. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago is a wonderful hotel. </s>
<s> Me and my husband recently stayed there on a summer vacation ; and it could n't have been better ! The staff was very polite and helpful ; and the rooms were very clean ; and they had some of the best beds I 've ever slept on ! Not to mention the view was amazing ! If I had to rate this hotel I 'd definitely give it five star ; next time I 'm in town I will most definitely stay there again ! My stay at the Amalfi was a very brief one. </s>
<s> booked the hotel based on all of the glowing reviews I saw here on Trip Advisor. </s>
<s> I arrived ; I sat down at a desk with an amazingly aloof clerk. </s>
<s> felt like I stepped into an episode of the Twilight Zone. </s>
<s> room was very small and dark. </s>
<s> the Internet was n't working. </s>
<s> was n't informed about this on my check in and could n't be given a time frame when it would be back up. </s>
<s> walked the neighborhood and found another hotel more to my liking ; gathered up my belongings and went there. </s>
<s> you 're one of those people who likes trendy upscale and chi chi locations and hotels ; you 'll lurve this place. </s>
<s> if you like a hotel with lights on ; working internet and a good view and real breakfast ; go someplace else. </s>
<s> House A Hilton Hotel - The Palmer House is situated in a great location for exploring the city of Chicago. </s>
<s> of the city 's highlights were within walking distance. </s>
<s> was able to take a nice stroll down to Grant Park from the hotel. </s>
<s> only were the surroundings a plus ; the Palmer House offered exceptional service. </s>
<s> room was quite spacious and provided an excellent way to end my days in Chicago. </s>
<s> Lockwood Restaurant prepared fresh local foods and the dinner was exquisite. </s>
<s> in all ; the Palmer House was a great stay and I would definitely recommend coming here. </s>
<s> stay at the Affinia last weekend was ideal and I ca n't wait to return. </s>
<s> was in town for a brief personal trip and wanted to have a clean ; lovely room near the shopping downtown. </s>
<s> fit the bill. </s>
<s> location was perfect ; just one block from the magnificent mile. </s>
<s> decor was modern and sleek ; and my room was impeccably clean. </s>

<s> 'll definitely be back. </s>
<s> ! My stay at the Talbott Hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels. </s>
<s> was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends. </s>
<s> receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the Talbott. </s>
<s> were promoting up to $ 30 breakfast credit per day. </s>
<s> breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time. </s>
<s> our arrival we were greeted by an employee ' which we would n't have known had he not told us that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group. </s>
<s> we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to King suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved. </s>
<s> someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms I would have sworn we were at Motel 6 ; not a luxury hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> linens were stained ; room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee. </s>
<s> was truly disgusted. </s>
<s> a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep. </s>
<s> next morning I was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests. </s>
<s> have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever eaten. </s>
<s> toast was stale ; eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs ; and the juice they served was sour. </s>
<s> would never recommend this as a place to stay. </s>
<s> would suggest the Red Roof Inn over this place anytime. </s>
<s> used to stay at the Homewood Suites all the time on business but have not stayed there on business since 2005 - since that time my company has been doing business in the suburbs instead of downtown. </s>
<s> December of 2007 and this year 2008 I did stay there a few days with my family and was greeted as if I never left. </s>
<s> is a lady named Connie who works the breakfast shift and she greets everyone and always remembers you from years before. </s>
<s> wonderful lady indeed - my wife even commented to me on the way to Chicago if that lady would still be there and would still remember and yes she does ! Its a great place to stay. </s>
<s> anyone is traveling to Chicago ; I would strongly recommend the Palmer House Hilton. </s>
<s> have spent two nights in this hotel during a recent business trip and I was impressed by the elegant feel and look of the hotel. </s>
<s> had a guest room with a double bed. </s>
<s> the first sight ; the room had perfect decor. </s>
<s> double bed looked comfy and cozy. </s>
<s> was n't just a room because it also came with high speed internet and personalized listening options which were great features for a tired traveler like me. </s>
<s> I was in a hurry in my two-day stay ; I did n't have time to wander around the town for food. </s>
<s> was n't a problem because the hotel offered a few places to dine or simply for snacks. </s>
<s> good thing is that their bar and lounge opened late at night. </s>
<s> can assure you that they had great quality food and drinks. </s>
<s> you are just touring the city ; the hotel is quite close to parks ; museum ; and a lot of shopping places. </s>
<s> you just need a place to stay ; the view from the hotel was pretty good as well. </s>

<s>  will come again ! Fairmont Chicago ; Millennium Park -- The Fairmont Chicago hotel is quite nice. </s>
<s> was impressed by the amount of sunlight my room received ' my room 's windows faced south. </s>
<s> lot of hotels have well decorated rooms but without good lighting the room can still feel off ; but the Fairmont Chicago does not make this mistake. </s>
<s> was disappointed by the provided moisturizer but I have sensitive skin so I brought my own just in case. </s>
<s> liked the proximity of the hotel to the fantastic sushi restaurant down the street. </s>
<s> this was quite the comfortable ' and delicious stay. </s>
<s> husband and I recently visited the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel on one of his business trips. </s>
<s> sometimes go along with him to see new places and to splurge on a mini-vacation while he is hard at work ' do n't worry- he likes when I return with little " souvenirs " for him ; too. </s>
<s> from the lovely city of Chicago ; this hotel was just amazing ! We had gotten in quite late that evening from our flight from Houston and were so tired ! The staff was genuine and friendly ; all while being professional and prompt. </s>

<s> tired to really take it in ; we were in bed and asleep in minutes. </s>
<s> beds were quite welcoming ! It was n't until the next morning that we were able to really take in all of the beautiful features of this hotel ! It 's gorgeous ! Everything was so clean and wonderfully decorated ! The lobby somehow did n't make it into our sleepy eyes the night before ; but it was just lovely ! Later that evening we decided to eat at their sushi restaurant. </s>
<s> is one of my husband 's favorites ; so he tends to be picky. </s>
<s> passed the test according to him ! We also enjoyed a glass of wine there as well . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  everything tasted great and was of excellent quality. </s>
<s> our two night stay there ; the only downfall was one occasion of there not being enough towels ' I use a lot of towels I suppose. </s>
<s> ; a simple phone called prompted a quick delivery of fluffy additional ones. </s>
<s> however was only a minor bump in the road to an entirely enjoyable and relaxing stay ! Overall -- we 'd love to go there again ! Maybe next time I can talk my husband into taking advantage of the spa . </s>

' wink Hard Rock Chicago - We heard good reviews of this hotel online ; and so when we were going to Chicago for a week ; we decided it would be a nice place to stay. </s>
<s> ; the rooms are nice beautiful even but for us it just was n't worth the price. </s>
<s> place was loud ; which we probably should have expected given the theme ; but we were assured it would n't be an issue. </s>
<s> we could have gotten by that ; had we been made to feel at home. </s>
<s> staff were cold and unfriendly ; and were often a disaster to deal with. </s>

<s> the evening wine hour was superb ; it did not make up for the other faults of the hotel ! I would not recommend a stay for any amount of time at Hotel Allegro. </s>
<s> stayed in the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel with my husband and two kids last weekend ; and will definitely use this hotel again for future travels. </s>
<s> spacious rooms with modern ; innovative furniture and comfortable beds was a great contrast to the small ; dismal rooms and rock-hard beds that I have found at other hotel chains. </s>
<s> bathrooms were neat ; tidy ; and well-stocked with towels and personal needs such as toilet paper ; shampoo ; and soap. </s>
<s> carpet was clean ' not stained and dingy like some hotels ; the room decor was astounding ; and the view from our window was wonderful. </s>
<s> enjoyed every aspect of this hotel stay ; from the courteous staff at check-in to the ease of requesting room service and checking out. </s>
<s> for making me feel right at home ! This hotel is totally overrated. </s>
<s> ; the location is awesome ; but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options. </s>
<s> customer service ; or lack thereof ; was particularly disappointing. </s>
<s> are they paying anywhere from 2 - 8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady ? Even when her hands are full. </s>
<s> housekeeping staff could n't figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip - every day. </s>
<s> ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you do n't bring it anyway. </s>
<s> stated previously ; the location is great. </s>
<s> ; however ; does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff. </s>
<s> would not stay here again. </s>
<s> booked at another hotel a block away and spent a unhappy night. </s>
<s> walked over to the Talbott and the courtiest staff showed us a room and we booked the rest of our stay. </s>
<s> room was very attractive and well furnished with double sinks in the bathroom. </s>
<s> tub is large and the shower a pleasure. </s>
<s> location was quiet as requested. </s>
<s> staff was always cheerful and very helpful. </s>
<s> and Stephanie provide excellent concierge services ! The breakfast at the Basil Cafe is a great way to start the day. </s>
<s> travel a lot and appreciate the ambiance of a good hotel. </s>
<s> would highly recommend the Talbott for your stay. </s>
<s> Hotel - Pricey ; inconvenient and a scam are all words I could use to describe my terrible time at the Talbott Hotel. </s>
<s> service was slow ; and " Greg ; " the concierge goon obviously showed he did n't want to be there ; a feeling I can empathize with. </s>
<s> room was plenty big but that means nothing when it is untidy and dirty. </s>
<s> I first got there ; the linens were obviously discolored by acts of which I shall not speak. </s>
<s> service was slow in responding ; so I went down to the market restaurant for a drink. </s>
<s> restraunt itself was extremely cramped and the chairs were so close I was basically sticking my nose where it did not belong. </s>
<s> food was mediocre ; the lemon taste was too sour and the ribs were drenched in disgusting barbeque sauce. </s>
<s> my room was finally ready ; I realized how small the room really was. </s>
<s> brown coloring on everything was so drab and boring. </s>
<s> bathroom was suitable for a midget since it was so small. </s>
<s> I can say is do not stay here unless you like bad service ; cramped rooms and terrible food. </s>
<s> loud noises coming from all directions did not help either. </s>
<s> all ; my trip was great ; I got to spend time with my best friend. </s>
<s> did some shopping and site seeing. </s>
<s> was overall great. </s>
<s> only thing was our hotel stay was not up to speed with other luxury hotels I have stayed at. </s>
<s> of the walls had wall paper missing ; most of the faucets leaked ; there was water stains on the ceiling in the bathrooms ; some of the furniture had very visible stains ; the fire alarm was coming off the wall in the main bedroom. </s>
<s> stayed in the corner suite on the 37 floor room 3711. </s>
<s> what ones pays for the room you would think the pool would be free and they would not charge for every single small amenity. </s>
<s> do not plan on staying there again. </s>
<s> from the trip was great ! The Hyatt Regency Chicago basically caters to guests who want to feel like they 're staying in a Nice Hotel as soon as they enter the lobby. </s>
<s> other words ; come here for the looks ; not the amenities. </s>
<s> make a big deal out of the fact that their bedsheets undergo a special de-germifying process . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  you know ; because a simple washing machine just is n't good enough. </s>
<s> me ; this sort of thing appeals to folks who enjoy being picky and narcissistic because they identify these traits with being " rich " -- which most of them are not. </s>
<s> ; the hotel does n't even offer free wireless -- an essential feature for business travelers like me. </s>
<s> I 'm not the intended consumer ; though ; so I guess I should n't be surprised. </s>
<s> booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend. </s>
<s> arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10 : 00 a. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; and they were able to give us our rooms early. </s>
<s> ! We were on the 5th floor ' Beatles theme. </s>
<s> rooms were very comfortable. </s>
<s> of our rooms was on a corner ; and had lots of windows. </s>
<s> other was was a bit larger with fewer windows. </s>
<s> a great view from our side of the hotel ; but we did n't pay for a room with a view. </s>
<s> beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable ; the bathroom was full of Aveda products ; and there was a bathrobe in the closet. </s>
<s> tv 'dvd 'stereo combo was nice ; but we were n't in the room a lot to use it. </s>
<s> were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks 'drinks as they were weighted and we 'd be charged. </s>
<s> problems there. </s>
<s> did not make use of the free fitness center ; because the weather was perfect. </s>
<s> husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead. </s>
<s> said it was wonderful. </s>
<s> did use the free internet in our rooms. </s>
<s> was ' wired internet ; but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway. </s>
<s> room was a bit dim at night ; but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps. </s>
<s> was virtually no hall elevator noise. </s>
<s> location of the Hard Rock is ideal. </s>
<s> is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery ; just blocks to either Grant Park ; The Art Institute ; State Street Shopping ; or Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> sum up ; there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about. </s>
<s> would be glad to stay here again any time. </s>
<s> beyond the rock theme and it 's an average hotel with a good location. </s>
<s> was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing. </s>
<s> goodness the window opened or we 'd have been cooked alive. </s>
<s> of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting. </s>
<s> was stuffy too. </s>
<s> marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions. </s>
<s> happy w Aveda in bath. </s>
<s> bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey. </s>
<s> impressed at ALL. </s>
<s> hotel itself looks really nice ; especially in the big foyer area. </s>
<s> room was small ; and the bathroom needed some major upgrades. </s>
<s> had the green tile ; like at your grandmother 's house ; all over the walls ; and 2 people could n't fit in it if you tried. </s>
<s> could hear the people beside us in the early morning every morning ; so obvioulsy the walls are n't so thick. </s>
<s> room looked directly on to a brick building outside ; VERY close ; we could n't even tell if it was nice outside or not. </s>
<s> are assuming we were not in a renovated room from the looks of it ; and I felt yucky the whole time in it. </s>
<s> just would n't pay lots of money to stay here ; there is nothing exceptional about it at all. </s>
<s> paid $ 75 a night through Priceline ; which is excellent for June. </s>
<s> room had a fantastic view of the Hancock Building and the river. </s>
<s> room was large ; clean and had a couch ; easy chair and desk chair. </s>
<s> bedding was the newer ' non-bedspread style ; the bed was comfortable ; the bathroom was large and ; well ; we were pleased with the room and the Hyatt in every way. </s>
<s> ate at the lobby restaurant ; which is attractively decorated and was bustling with activity when we were there. </s>
<s> only got Cobb Salads ; so I do n't know if the food ; in general ; is good or not. </s>
<s> Cobb was so-so. </s>
<s> only complaint was the $ 48 fee to park your car over-night and the $ 13 daily fee for the internet. </s>
<s> places are offering free internet these days and I wish the Hyatt would hop on board with this concept. </s>
<s> hated to leave ! Beautiful historic hotel -- and since I 'm in historic building business ; was looking forward to stay. </s>
<s> rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite ; they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up -- duct work torn apart in bathroom ; lamp fixtures literally falling off wall ; mirror torn off wall ; etc. </s>
<s> up in a room on 20th floor -- much nicer ; but yesterday waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions. </s>
<s> two of three elevators to top floors work -- and these two elevators skip floors ; so you can be stuck waiting for ever. </s>
<s> I raised this to hotel staff ; was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it. </s>
<s> ; no. </s>
<s> is not an old building problem ; this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it. </s>
<s> way down ; stay away. </s>
<s> to the Drake or Knickerbocker if you 're looking for old world charm ; sans hassle. </s>
<s> I walked into the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel ; my first thought was ; " wow this is very yellow " ; and not the good kind of yellow like a sunny day ; no the ugly yellow that you would want to wash off your pretty white blouse. </s>
<s> room was fairly descent although the yellow theme seemed to leak in. </s>
<s> was a Victorian feeling in the lobby that turned into a modern feeling in the rooms and bathrooms. </s>
<s> would have liked to see less yellow and maybe a bit more of that fancy feeling from the lobby in the rooms. </s>
<s> hotel lost our reservations and then couldi n't accommodate what we needed. </s>
<s> gave us a room much smaller than we needed and when we requested something diffrerent they were unable to fulfill our request. </s>
<s> opted to leave the hotel and after there mistake of losing our reservations ; they still charged us an early check out fee. </s>
<s> it was n't for the great location of the hotel ; there would be nothing positive to say This hotel can not be beat for location ; price ; atmosphere. </s>
<s> location is ideal ; at the corner of State Kinzie. </s>
<s> are fantastic restaurants bars all around ; including House of Blues Harry Caray 's. </s>
<s> stayed in a " Corner King " room. </s>
<s> room was amazing. </s>
<s> of the four walls are floor to ceiling windows. </s>
<s> just being on the 5th floor ; we had great views of the surrounding area. </s>
<s> decor and amenities are unmatched. </s>
<s> decor is very clean simple but luxurious. </s>
<s> hotel is easy to miss from street level ; but should n't be. </s>
<s> staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. </s>
<s> a perfect home base if your plans revolve around River North ; State Street shopping ; or Clark Street nightlife. </s>
<s> if you 'll be on the Mag Mile ; this is a short cab ride away. </s>
<s> 've officially named this our downtown hotel of choice ! My husband and me reserved a room online for the Chicago Hilton. </s>
<s> were looking for a quit few days away from home and work. </s>
<s> what we found was not what we were looking for. </s>
<s> of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos. </s>
<s> floors looked like they have n't been cleaned in a while in the check in area. </s>
<s> room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side. </s>
<s> staff was horrible. </s>
<s> had asked for a turn down service it was never received. </s>
<s> would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone. </s>
<s> is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the Hilton. </s>
<s> staff recognizes you by name with excellent eye contact. </s>
<s> " welcome back " sets the tone for your stay. </s>
<s> in the lobby and reception area beautiful. </s>
<s> house-keeping staff is terrific ; helpful and prompt. </s>
<s> service food was served hot and that makes a big difference too. </s>
<s> Room food was surprising tasty and impressed my clients. </s>
<s> done ! My girlfriends and I stayed 4 nights at the Talbott returning home on Saturday 9 '29. </s>
<s> all had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. </s>
<s> staff from top to bottom were excellent ; accommodating. </s>
<s> room was roomy . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> with our only complaint being not being able to cool the room fast enough after a day on the town. </s>
<s> construction next door was obstructing the sidewalk ; but being on a oneway street limited that difficulty. </s>
<s> doorman ; Andrew was an excellent source at this hotel. </s>
<s> arranged all our transportation at night to restaurants. </s>
<s> enjoyed everything about the hotel and the city. </s>
<s> hotel was expensive but met expectations. </s>
<s> hotel is absolutely beautiful. </s>
<s> is elegant ; comfortable and a very relaxing stay. </s>
<s> was easy to get to the airport and very close to shopping. </s>
<s> felt like a king in a castle surrounded by luxury and beauty. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel to anyone. </s>
<s> recently stayed in the Talbott Hotel in Chicago with my family of three. </s>
<s> absolutely loved it and will definitely return ! The customer service of the staff at the front desk was fantastic. </s>
<s> were very helpful in helping us decide on what activities to do and what restaurants to visit during our stay. </s>
<s> the nights we did n't want to go out ; we had room service. </s>
<s> food from the Hotel restaurant was so delicious and the service was very quick. </s>
<s> also loved their commitment to the environment. </s>
<s> is clear to me why they have won so many awards. </s>
<s> you Talbott for a wonderful stay ! This is one of the best hotels I have ever been in. </s>
<s> went there to see about scheduling my reception party ; and was amazed at the architecture of the building ; the interior design of the rooms ; and the massive spacing provided for each room. </s>
<s> I recommend this hotel to my associates to hold their important business meetings in the James Club ; so that after the meetings ; we can partake in a nice meal and drinks. </s>
<s> brings me to my next point. </s>
<s> James has some of the BEST food I have ever eaten ! The James Private Club ; I feel was made for the elite and upper class. </s>
<s> classy ; very elegant. </s>
<s> customer service is outstanding. </s>
<s> recommend this hotel to anyone needing to hold a reception ; business meeting ; or just need to have a day at the spa. </s>
<s> 5 stars all the way ! At the InterContinental Chicago ; you pay for more than a room. </s>
<s> pay for an experience. </s>
<s> me elaborate. </s>
<s> was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities. </s>
<s> any novice traveller to Chicago ; I saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs ; and those were originally what I set my sights on. </s>
<s> is a powerful signal ; and the sheer discount of those options drew me in. </s>
<s> after doing a bit of research ; I realised that distance does have its costs. </s>
<s> price of transit in the Chicagoland area is n't free. </s>
<s> it 's far from what I 'm used to. </s>
<s> use is price prohibitive. </s>
<s> I knew that originally ; which is why I was n't going to drive. </s>
<s> '
But the sting of using the automobile ' parking ; congestion ; toll roads ; etc. </s>
<s> ' gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental. </s>
<s> ; I ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit. </s>
<s> mass transit has its costs too ; which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages. </s>
<s> 's what originally drew me to InterContinental. </s>
<s> InterContinental is much more than the right room at the right place. </s>
<s> decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable. </s>
<s> was travelling on international business ; so the ease with which I could transact in foreign currency was a draw. </s>
<s> They had a currency exchange right there on the premises. </s>
<s> '
And the fact that massages ; dry cleaning ; and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus. </s>
<s> work gets me tied up in knots. </s>
<s> also leaves little time for doing chores. </s>
<s> the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me. </s>
<s> ; on top of all that ; the event planning was what put InterContinental over the top. </s>
<s> able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of Chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders -- and something I wo n't forget. </s>
<s> the end ; if you 're a newcomer to Chicago staying in a time-crunch ; the InterContinental is for you. </s>
<s> pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive ; but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs ; it 's nothing in the end. </s>
<s> the InterContinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options ; it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed in this hotel for what was supposed to be a romantic weekend. </s>
<s> was far from that ! We could hear the television in the neighboring room and when we called the front desk to complain ; the person who answered the phone was extremely rude ! We were unable to relax at all ! Also ; the room was not very clean ; there was a definite smell of cigarette smoke and the bed was as hard as a rock. </s>
<s> will not be returning to this awful place ! I recently stayed at The James during a business trip to Chicago and I would certainly recommend it. </s>
<s> hotel is well located in downtown ; only a few blocks from millenium park and other attractions. </s>
<s> room was very nice ; with a soft bed and plenty of windows and natural light. </s>
<s> also had the opportunity to use the Gym ; which was well equipped and had even an instructor which gave me some tips. </s>
<s> was n't too impressed by the restaurant though. </s>
<s> was rather boring and the place very pretentious. </s>
<s> ; price was fair for a hotel of its class and staff were helpful and very competent. </s>
<s> lobby of the Homewood is right down the hall from the kitchen and dining room 'actually more of a grade school cafeteria type set up. </s>
<s> odors from the kitchen were disgusting ; and indeed reminded my of that of a institutional kitchen 'I. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> hospital. </s>
<s> free breakfast and free dinner were not at all palatable. </s>
<s> suppose that if you are traveling with a young family as many guests were ; that makes this hotel a good value. </s>
<s> i would not stay here again. </s>
<s> much too overpriced in my opinion ; the hotel is spotless. </s>
<s> staff was very courteous. </s>
<s> the spa service ? Was a God send ! In a relatively flexible location for traveling for sight seeing so I didnt spend major bucks trying to get around the city ! LOVE IT ! Going back for my anniversary OK ; we are back from the Knickerbocker and I would give it the best rating. </s>
<s> ca n't believe the bad reviews. </s>
<s> got a priceline deal ; and I still got a fine room ; clean ; up-to-date furnishings ' OK a little traditional for my taste and smoke free. </s>
<s> said in another thread that some people write prank reviews. </s>
<s> think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth. </s>
<s> it is from my point of view. </s>

<s> was a great hotel experience and I would stay there again. </s>
<s> check-in was great ; but then we got into our room. </s>
<s> carpet was drenched and stained near the bathroom because the shower ' open concept leaks water onto the floor since there are no doors on it. </s>
<s> mini bar was broken and put an extremely foul scent into the room. </s>
<s> final hotel bill reflected 2 charges that were incorrect . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 1 for the mini bar which we did not utilize ; and the second was an up charge for a bottle of wine $ 69 instead of $ 50. </s>
<s> my husband went to the front desk to have it corrected ; he was met with a very unfriendly and unapologetic employee. </s>
<s> was adjusted ; but not without confrontation. </s>
<s> was another guest checking out when my husband was at the front desk who had the same " mysterious " mini bar charge on her bill as well ; and was trying to have it corrected. </s>

<s> did my name printed on things become an extra amenity that cost so much money ? I basically felt overcharged for the so called ' extras included in the package i purchased. </s>

<s> Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I have stayed there for 3 days last week and ; looking for something better than usual ; I have paid for the Superior Room. </s>
<s> was a bad choice. </s>

<s> had my reservation code and the email confirmation but they insisted they could n't find me " in the system " . </s>
<s> finally agreed to scrap that reservation and start over. </s>
<s> process was lengthy as they were training a new girl on how to take reservations. </s>

<s> finally delivered ; it was cold and not exactly how I had ordered it. </s>
<s> now I am cranky ; tired and starving ! I ate what I could from the mini bar ' poor selection of items and went to bed. </s>

<s> Chicago - I recently stayed 4 nights at the Sheraton for a business trip ; and I must say that it is among the nicest hotels that I have ever stayed at. </s>
<s> the room I stayed in did not have a spectacular view ; it was very clean and cozy so I was completely satisfied. </s>
<s> bathroom was beautifully decorated ; and the room very spacious : there was plenty of storage room in the closet as well as workspace on the two tables. </s>
<s> had a company dinner at Shula 's Steakhouse downstairs ; and the food was delicious ; definitely deserving of the Top 10 Steakhouses in America award. </s>
<s> was also convenient was the fact that there is a FedEx office in the hotel ; so when my wife overnighted an important document I had forgotten at home ; the hotel had it delivered right to my room. </s>

<s> seems to have a cough today. </s>
<s> the room on my right ; someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit. </s>
<s> hear the water running and the toilet flushing. </s>

<s> 've stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst. </s>
<s> room is dirty - the carpet covered in spots and stains ; the curtains with a large brown stain ' I do n't want to guess what it is ; paint peeling ; rips in the wallpaper. </s>
<s> decor is a bit garish ; with Pepto-Bismol covered walls ; green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet. </s>
<s> size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable ; but I 'm so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others toilets flushing all night. </s>
<s> location is good for downtown theaters or business. </s>
<s> three elevators serve this 17 storey building and they run very slowly. </s>
<s> has many nice hotel options -- many I 've enjoyed quite a bit. </s>
<s> this is not one of them ; and even more unfortunate for me : I 'm stuck here for two more nights. </s>

<s> only thing complaint I can think about is that sometimes in the morning the maid service would be too loud in the hallway and wake me up. </s>
<s> in all ; my stay in the Millennium was great ! Anyone who 's looking for an affordable stay in a luxury hotel should definitely check out the Millennium. </s>
<s> family and I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers with the belief our stay would be a 5 star experience. </s>
<s> was the farthest thing from the truth. </s>
<s> staff was very rude and unhelpful. </s>
<s> hotel is so large that you will get lost if you dont have the help of the staff. </s>
<s> we did find our room our card would not get us in and we had to start all over. </s>
<s> overall it took over an hour just to get us in a room. </s>
<s> we entered the room we noticed a foul smell that we just overlooked because we were happy to just finally be able to rest. </s>
<s> wife went to the bathroom ; and to our amazement there was what appeared to be dog hair all over the tub and tile floor. </s>

<s> being in the room for about 30 minutes ; there was a knock at the door that just happened to be the Chicago police. </s>
<s> was a report of the smell of marijuana coming from the room ! My family was put through a series of embarrasing questions and actually had our luggage and personal belongings searched. </s>
<s> was a small amount of marijuana found in the drawer of the dresser that we never touched. </s>
<s> to find out after video surveillance ; the cleaning lady was arrested for possession of marijuana. </s>
<s> to say ; our stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was the worst part of our vacation and I would not recommend anyone to stay at this place. </s>
<s> had never been to Chicago and was looking forward to sightseeing after my business conference. </s>
<s> company had arranged for me to stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel located in the center of the Magnificent Mile. </s>
<s> I arrived at the hotel and gave it the once over ; I was pleased but not impressed. </s>
<s> I put down by luggage and inquired about my reservation. </s>
<s> was told that my room was not ready yet and that there 'd be an hour delay. </s>
<s> tried not to lose my temper and pleasantly asked if I could have another room. </s>
<s> was told there was a convention going on in the hotel and every room was filled. </s>
<s> would have left ; but my company had a account at this hotel. </s>
<s> I stayed somewhere else ; I 'd have to pay out of pocket. </s>
<s> service employee behind the counter flippantly told me to take a seat and went back to talking with his gum-chewing co-worker. </s>
<s> picked up my luggage and plopped down in a cushy chair that wobbled. </s>
<s> leg in front on the left side was broken. </s>
<s> picked up my luggage and moved to another chair. </s>
<s> hours passed by before I was given my room. </s>
<s> I walked into the room the first thing I smelled was cigarette smoke. </s>
<s> was mad because I explicitly asked for a " non-smoking " room. </s>
<s> was furious. </s>
<s> did n't feel like going back downstairs and dealing with the idiot behind the counter and I was tried from my long flight. </s>
<s> sighed ; tipped the bellboy and slammed the door to my room. </s>
<s> thought maybe I could use the air conditioning to freshen the room. </s>
<s> I went to turn it on ; it did n't work. </s>
<s> and angry ; I went to sleep ; thinking I 'll never stay at this hotel again. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 5 days in October ; 2007. </s>

<s> checking it out before booking my reservation ; I could tell that it had changed ; but I completely underestimated how much. </s>
<s> hotel was completely renovated in 2010. </s>
<s> renovation seemed to do nothing more than act as an excuse to raise the prices. </s>
<s> rooms are EXACTLY the same. </s>
<s> is still the same subpar restaurant in the lobby. </s>
<s> why am I paying 50 % more than last time I was here ? Even worse ; the gym has been downgraded. </s>
<s> 'm the type of person who needs to exercise everyday ; even on vacation. </s>
<s> treadmills and a rack of weights is not a gym ! The pictures on the website with regard to this " gym " are completely misleading. </s>
<s> ; if this place marketed itself as a 3 star hotel ' AND the price reflected it ; then perhaps my stay would have been adequate. </s>
<s> I ca n't forgive the false advertising and general snotty atmosphere from what is really no better than any 3 star hotel. </s>
<s> some money ; stay in the Holiday Inn. </s>
<s> if you really want a luxurious experience ; look elsewhere. </s>
<s> I truly enjoyed my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. </s>
<s> stayed in a suite ; which was clean and extremely nice ; at a very reasonable rate. </s>
<s> husband and I spent quite a bit of time in the indoor pool ; but personally I preferred laying out on the sundeck. </s>

<s> Chicago it was 5 : 00 AM my plan just flew in and I was tired I checked myself into the Confad Chicago when I first got there there was a creepy employe the floor was filthy but I got my room in the 5th level of then as I dashed towards the elevator my suite case in hand I entered it then that 's where I started to see the beauti of the place the walls where polished wood there was even a small AC 'heater unit and it was good. </s>

<s> was shocked to find how confrotable the bed was . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  perfect ! And it had leather pillows and a huge blanket then just when I did n't think it could get any better I look my bathroom its perfect stone and gold ! The water actually has a good taste to it like grapes I was so shocked I fell uncontentious I was drowning cause my face fell into the toilet then I woke up you wont believe how fast the assistance will save your life there ! I when t back up into my floor and guess what I say out the windows a swimming pool and it was huge Olympic sized swimming pool It was great. </s>
<s> got on my beach suit and went down there and it was heated over all I do n't think I can leave and all of the other swimmers where pretty nice rich people and they where alright though a little big stuck up but not too much. </s>
<s> came dinner time perfect. </s>
<s> must say I am extremely satisfied with my visit ! Time to fly back to where I cam from and then my plan took off i 'm going to miss that hotel 10 '10 ! Imagine flying to the windy city for business. </s>
<s> a long flight with many delays you get a cab to your hotel ; the much-hyped Conrad. </s>
<s> 've been expecting to fall into a soft bed with a lovely view of the Chicago skyline out your window. </s>
<s> 's exactly how I imagined it after my delayed flight and terrible cab ride. </s>
<s> 's the opposite of how it turned out. </s>
<s> got in to the lobby late and the person at the counter was busy talking on their cellphone. </s>
<s> approached and they did n't even hang up. </s>
<s> were going on about how they thought the whole Charlie Sheen thing was overblown. </s>
<s> do n't care. </s>
<s> 's late. </s>
<s> have meetings the next day. </s>
<s> try to check in and they say they ca n't find my reservation. </s>
<s> is despite the fact I have my receipt with me ! Finally ; they check me in and do n't even bother to have a bellhop help me with my bags. </s>
<s> is n't a cheap room. </s>
<s> 's standard to treat your customers with some level of respect. </s>
<s> get to my room and I open the door and it 's someone else 's room ! Somehow they 've given me the wrong room and activated my key for that person 's room. </s>
<s> yet ; the occupant was passed out drunk on the bed with his clothes strewn all over the room. </s>

<s> I get up there and my room is missing a pillow. </s>
<s> ? How can the maid not notice. </s>
<s> bed was made. </s>
<s> must 've been in the room and seen that there was one too few pillows. </s>
<s> episode was exemplary of the rest of my stay. </s>
<s> to say ; neither I nor my business will be using the services of the Conrad in Chicago. </s>
<s> was highly disappointed with my choice to stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> had to travel for business at the last minute but felt lucky to get a reservation at such a highly rated hotel. </s>
<s> initial impression was that the desk clerk thought I was lucky that he was waiting on me. </s>
<s> had several questions about local attractions and he acted as though I was bothering him. </s>
<s> was the only customer in the lobby and he directed me to a rack of brochures located near the concierge then went back to leaning against the counter. </s>
<s> the plus side the room was lovely ; but when I called for room service at 9 : 30pm I was told they were closed even though the menu said they served until 10pm. </s>
<s> decided to go out rather than fight the issue. </s>
<s> next day the tone was the same at the pool ; the bar ; the restaurant etc. </s>
<s> staff here seems to have a general feeling that the guests are lucky enough to stay in such a chic hotel and they are more like part of the atmosphere instead of actual employees with a job to do. </s>
<s> only exception was the housekeeping staff. </s>
<s> called them for extra pillows and another blanket and they were at my door in 10 minutes and made to ask if there was anything else I needed before leaving. </s>
<s> bottom line is that I booked my room here with the intention to relax for a day or two after my business was completed but decided against it. </s>
<s> though the hotel was beautiful and in a nice location ; the atmosphere was not inviting. </s>
<s> 'd rather go somewhere where I felt like my money was appreciated instead of staying somewhere that did n't seem to care that I was there. </s>

<s> admitted it was their fault ; and now they wo n't pay the $ 500 to fix it because we ca n't prove it was not broken before ! the hotel is wonderful ; the rooms are new and nice ; but we will never stay here again because of this . </s>

<s> Be sure to inspect your car before you leave ! My wife and I stayed at the Amalfi on a trip to visit our son and some friends from Norway who were vacationing in the City. </s>
<s> were excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading the reviews here ; but really disappointed in the accommodations. </s>
<s> web site has a photo of the 18 story building that houses the hotel. </s>
<s> does n't state that the hotel only occupies the first 6 floors of the building. </s>
<s> rest are offices. </s>
<s> room was on the 4th floor with a view of a blank brick wall about 16 feet distant. </s>
<s> room itself was unremarkable ; with standard furnishings equivalent to a Holiday Inn. </s>
<s> it is close to the best part of the City ; it is tucked behind the new Trump Tower and opens on a surprisingly sketchy stretch of road 'sidewalk. </s>
<s> Norwegian friends ; by contrast ; stayed on the 33rd floor of Swissotel and had views of the Lake and Navy Pier. </s>
<s> come to Chicago with my three sisters for a relaxing weekend of shopping and spa days ; the Hotel Allegro Chicago filled every bit of my checklist. </s>

<s> was close to shopping ; local attractions like the Shedd Aquarium and even the Navy Pier. </s>

A continental breakfast is available for a nominal fee ; unless purchased with a package deal ; in their own upscale restaurant ; Nix ! We would definitely book a suite there again and highly recommend this hotel to all our friends and family ! My recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was everything I desired and more for my luxury shopping weekend in Chicago. </s>

<s> room was not huge ; but very comfortable. </s>

<s> is a fridge stocked with soft drinks ; water and juice that are yours for the taking. </s>
<s> were very pleased with the upgraded Towers ; everyone should check it out ! Extremely disappointed in our stay. </s>
<s> hotel did not look like what pictures portrayed online. </s>
<s> booked online thinking what a perfect place this was going to be ; only to arrive and have a room without a view even though that is what was paid for. </s>
<s> room smelled musty and not clean. </s>
<s> was not changed from prior person. </s>

<s> to complain and someone came up 2 hours later and used bug spray. </s>
<s> this hotel is in a great location ; but we would never visit again. </s>
<s> was not overly friendly or helpful and the room was not as all as it seemed online. </s>
<s> the Amalfi doesnt come close to justifying the glowing comments on TA. </s>

<s> hotel is not more than 6 or 7 flors high and the garbage pick up woke me up daily at 5 am. </s>
<s> 530 ; when you are just nodding off again ; they begin setting up for the complimentary breakfast. </s>
<s> is a continental buffet on every floor next to the elevator bank. </s>
<s> room within 100 feet of the elevators will hear the noise. </s>
<s> was a bit tacky and the " staff " was a little rough around the edges. </s>
<s> did n't see a single business travellers while I was there. </s>

<s> was the same chairs and drapes you see everywhere ; but a bit worse for the wear. </s>
<s> coffee table by the bed was wobbly ' enough that you would n't want to set a drink down on it ; and the couch under the window was lacking cushioning ' it felt like you were sitting on a wood beam. </s>
<s> ; you can hear your neighbors through the walls. </s>
<s> had a wonderful time at the James Hotel while on business in Chicago. </s>
<s> rooms are modern ; tasteful and well-kept ; while the staff was responsive and efficient. </s>
<s> was the perfect place to unwind after working all day ; but also provided an ideal atmosphere to do some more work. </s>

<s> ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict. </s>
<s> were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we did n't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast. </s>

<s> two nights at the InterContinental on a business trip. </s>
<s> is a tremendous ; towering hotel in one of the best locations in Chicago -- right on the Magnificent Mile and superbly convenient for shopping and well placed for the business area. </s>
<s> room was in the Historic Tower -- a 1920s Masonic Club which has been converted at enormous expense. </s>
<s> effort has been worthwhile. </s>
<s> room was very large and well furnished ; with a beautiful bathroom which contained a separate shower cubicle. </s>
<s> had breathtaking views down Michigan Avenue. </s>
<s> is a superb recreation centre ' with an impressive swimming pool beautiful bars and a good restaurant ; Zest ; that serves a great breakfast. </s>
<s> is wifi in the rooms $ 9. </s>
<s> per day and tea and coffee making facilities. </s>
<s> trouser press ; but there is an ironing board and iron. </s>
<s> staff is friendly and anxious to please. </s>
<s> recommend this hotel in the strongest possible terms. </s>
<s> 's expensive ; but it will be difficult to find a better one in Chicago. </s>
<s> really had high hopes for Homewood Suites when I stayed there on a week-long business trip last month. </s>
<s> all ; considering their prices ' it 's technically a Hilton ; you would expect something above and beyond a typical cut-rate bargain motel. </s>
<s> 'll start with the good stuff about the hotel : it 's in downtown. </s>
<s> for the bad stuff : first ; everyone is rude. </s>
<s> 'm not sure if management intentionally hires rude people or if the poisonous culture inside the hotel grinds otherwise decent people into cynical pulp. </s>
<s> bellboy scowled at me in the lobby ; was rough with my luggage ; and then scowled at me again when I tipped him $ 5. </s>
<s> ; the receptionist seemed flustered and in over her head. </s>
<s> had to call her supervisor over ' twice just to check me in ; and I had a reservation ! Apparently she was new ; and did n't have much experience using the computer ; but that 's no excuse : it turned what would have been a two-minute process at a decent hotel into 15 minutes of tedium. </s>
<s> ; the room was no better than the service. </s>
<s> hot water in the sink did not work ; the shower was only lukewarm ; and one of the bulbs was dead in the light fixture above the sink. </s>
<s> mood lighting ; I guess. </s>
<s> TV was a bust ; sure it was an LCD ; but the ESPN logo at the bottom right corner of the screen was burned in and stayed there on every channel. </s>
<s> to top it all off ; the bed smelled funny. </s>
<s> called the front desk ' at least the phone worked ; and asked for fresh sheets. </s>
<s> person I talked to said they 'd be right up ; but never came. </s>
<s> ; I gave up. </s>
<s> woke up the next morning to back pain ' the bed was about as firm as a marshmallow. </s>
<s> left the room ; and made my way through the chilly hallways to the " complimentary buffet. </s>
<s> " 
Literally all the food was bad. </s>
<s> the cereal tasted stale. </s>
<s> around ; everyone in the dinning room appeared to be having a similar experience. </s>
<s> sight of two-dozen disappointed people sipping weak coffee and prodding watered-down scrambled eggs with plastic forks was a sight more becoming of a refugee camp than an expensive hotel. </s>
<s> plain sad. </s>
<s> part was ; it was the same thing for the next four days ; too. </s>
<s> my stay at the Hilton Chicago it has been quite unpleasant. </s>
<s> so you might ask ? Well ill tell you ; the towels where scratchy and the service was terrible and by terrible I mean they were n't even at the desk when I checked in. </s>
<s> ; When I ordered my breakfast ; lunch ; and dinner from room service I received the wrong order for all meals and felt a little sick after lunch. </s>
<s> ; The bill was charging me for stuff I did n't want or ask for. </s>
<s> overall the hotel was very bad and unpleasant for me and others. </s>
<s> give it a half a star. </s>
<s> will never use Ambassador East Hotel again. </s>
<s> first appearance you get is a very dark and dreary type setting. </s>
<s> exterior of the hotel was in desperate need of repair. </s>
<s> customer service was not as good as you would expect when spending your hard earned money on a hotel room. </s>
<s> this hotel you are spending more than the average amount of money on a room that is smaller than the average hotel room. </s>
<s> felt rushed out at check out and did n't have an enjoyable experience at all. </s>
<s> Chicago ; Millennium Park - My stay at Fairmont during my last visit was not a pleasing one. </s>
<s> was the place where furniture goes before anything else. </s>
<s> only good thing about hotel was its good location. </s>
<s> wallpaper was coming off the wall. </s>
<s> table lamp in our room had no bulb in it. </s>
<s> we called room service to get us one ; we had to wait for half an hour before we finally got some light in the room. </s>
<s> service stinks and so do the rooms. </s>
<s> am NEVER EVER going back to this place. </s>
<s> staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel ; was a waste of money. </s>
<s> rooms are typical standard rooms ; 'unless you want to pay an unreasonable amount for one of the premier rooms ; the service from the staff was nothing to rave about unless ; your ideal ; idea of service is waiting in the lobby for 40 minutes waiting for anybody to help you carry your heavy luggage up to your room. </s>
<s> to say in short I think my money would have been better spent staying at a HoJo 's. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago ; and it was one of the worst experiences I 've ever had at a high-end hotel. </s>
<s> was in Chicago for a conference ; and I thought I would enjoy the experience more if I had somewhere pleasant and relaxing to return to ; but this hotel definitely was n't that place. </s>
<s> restaurants were mediocre at best ; despite their high prices ; I repeatedly got food that was bland ; overcooked ; or lukewarm. </s>
<s> room was fine ; but nothing special ; I think I 'd have been just as comfortable in almost any hotel in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> big part of my discomfort and dissatisfaction with the hotel ; though ; was with their Jet Set Pets program ; it 's hard to find a decent ; relaxing hotel that I 'll like that will also accept my dog. </s>
<s> many of the employees were rude about my adopted mutt ; who is energetic and loves people but is n't the most photogenic dog - he has a scar on his face and he 's got that terrier look. </s>
<s> people mocked him ; or said there was no point grooming him ; or asked why I wanted him sleeping on a bed in my room. </s>
<s> know that it 's a fairly high-end hotel ; but I would hope for better service regardless of the class associations of the dogs. </s>
<s> hope they at least treat all of the dogs boarded there well. </s>
<s> experience was overall frustrating and unsatisfactory ; especially for the price. </s>
<s> can give them good marks on their spa services ; and I really appreciated the pillow " menu ; " but other than that it did n't feel like a particularly luxurious or indulgent experience ; especially given the customer service. </s>
<s> got a great deal on this hotel ; just $ 91 found through travelzoo. </s>
<s> only stayed one night ; but were very impressed. </s>
<s> sevice was fantastic from the moment we stepped up to the property. </s>
<s> hotel smelled wonderful and was immaculate. </s>
<s> room ; while not enormous was perfect. </s>
<s> had a great view of the city and lake. </s>
<s> bed was extremely comfortable. </s>
<s> never heard any noise outside of our room. </s>
<s> bathroom was nice sized considering we must have had one of the smaller rooms in the hotel ; two could get ready very comfortably. </s>
<s> was perfect ; just off Michigan Ave and steps away from Millenium Park. </s>
<s> would definetly stay here again ; especially if we could get this great deal ! Not worth the price ! I had the unfortunate experience of staying in the Hilton Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> stayed there with my family while we were on vacation. </s>
<s> wish I would have saved my money and went somewhere else. </s>
<s> a hotel this expensive ; you think that they might throw in some bonuses your way ; like complimentary parking. </s>
<s> a chance. </s>
<s> addition to the $ 259 price tag ; I also had to pay $ 30 for parking ; per night. </s>
<s> I had stayed at the Motel 6 ; parking would have been free. </s>
<s> staff there were not very nice at all. </s>
<s> I registered ; the lady at the counter acted like helping me was interfering with her internet chat time. </s>
<s> was very rude to me. </s>
<s> she was having a bad day or something ; but I doubt it. </s>
<s> I arrived in my room ; my key card did n't work ; and I had to go back downstairs to get it fixed ' once again ; interrupting her precious free time with some actual work. </s>
<s> rooms had some nice features ; like kitchen appliances and a flat screen television. </s>
<s> did n't go on vacation to cook though. </s>
<s> television did n't get very many channels ; and you had to pay if you wanted to watch any of their movies ' of course. </s>
<s> tried logging into Facebook to say hello to my friends from the hotel room ; but the " complimentary " internet access was so slow that it was hardly worth using. </s>
<s> get a better connection at Starbucks. </s>
<s> offer a complimentary dinner and breakfast ; but it 's nothing to write home about. </s>
<s> 've had better food at McDonald 's. </s>
<s> food was pretty cold ; and the choices are very limited. </s>
<s> around the hotel was hideous. </s>
<s> hotel is downtown ; and you can definitely tell. </s>
<s> are a bunch of one-way streets around ; which makes getting in and out confusing. </s>
<s> room was pretty clean ; but you can say that about a lot of hotels in a wide variety of price ranges. </s>
<s> you 're looking for a hotel in Chicago ; I 'd say save some money and go somewhere else. </s>
<s> 've had better stays at the Best Western and many other hotels that cost less. </s>
<s> planned to stay for 5 nights on a family trip. </s>
<s> booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast - get a quick bite ; then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff. </s>
<s> ; our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly ; and thankfully ; switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights. </s>
<s> room was dirty. </s>
<s> we opened the sofabed ; the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out. </s>
<s> considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used ; and theoretically cleaned ; a lot. </s>
<s> blankets were also dirty and bathrooms were n't much better. </s>
<s> control in the room was imprecise - minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night ; it made for a cold stay. </s>
<s> you like to eat for free ' they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights and do n't care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer ; I guess some may find this place tolerable. </s>
<s> we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral. </s>
<s> only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area ' we switched to The James and had a great experience. </s>
<s> could n't be paid to stay here again. </s>
<s> 'm shocked by the high overall rating given our experience. </s>
<s> you have not tried the Millennium Knickerbocker for a stay in Chicago ; do it now ! We have stayed ' and enjoyed at the Drake ; Intercontinental and others ; but we always now come back to the Knickerbocker. </s>
<s> ? If " Charlie " the doorman is on duty and you pull up ; he will welcome you. </s>
<s> 'll probably ask your name. </s>
<s> ? Because he wants to call you by your name every time he will see you during your visit. </s>
<s> he even lets the other employees know your name and all of a sudden ; doorman ; receptionist ; bellman ; waiter are referring to you by name. </s>
<s> employees are what makes this hotel. </s>
<s> ; it has everything to offer like all hotels ; but the others do n't have the fine people ' including the cleaning staff these folks have. </s>
<s> it ; you will like it. </s>
<s> look forward to our next visit already . </s>

I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago during Labor day weekend ; huge mistake ! When I got to my room everything seemed okay ; Until I went into the bathroom. </s>
<s> was a steady drip noise coming from the bathroom sink and no matter how hard I turned the knob ; it would not stop. </s>
<s> was none of the usual bath soap nor was it stocked with any toilet paper. </s>
<s> also seems that housekeeping just swept everything behind the toilet as I saw a wad of hair ; and scraps of tissue behind the bowl. </s>
<s> called the front desk and ask them to send someone up to stock the bathroom and clean it. </s>
<s> I was waiting I turned on the air conditioning because it was kind of warm in there . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  the a. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> started blowing out hot ; musky air and had the room smelling horrible. </s>
<s> made another phone call to front desk and complained and asked them to switch my room. </s>
<s> told me all they had available was a double bed and it was near an elevator. </s>
<s> was so frustrated between the odor and the steady drip I was hearing I had no choice but to take it. </s>
<s> I moved to the new room ; there was now a large damp spot near the window which smelled very strongly of beer and the light in my bathroom would not turn on. </s>
<s> desk once again sent someone to my room to fix the problems and finally 2 hours later ; I was able to relax and settle in. </s>
<s> Rock is definitely not what it used to be and for that reason ; I will not be staying there again. </s>
<s> Chicago Millennium Park - I attended a conference held at this hotel and also stayed here for 3 nights. </s>
<s> you 're going to be stuck in a hotel for a few days ; this one is not too shabby. </s>
<s> ; spacious rooms ; bathrooms do n't feel cramped ; and the bed --- pretty comfortable. </s>
<s> slept really well and woke up easily to a very bright room. </s>
<s> love big windows and morning light ; and my corner room had all of these. </s>
<s> only wish the hotel had a pool because I missed my late-night swims. </s>
<s> ; ca n't complain. </s>
<s> location ; prompt service and nice decor. </s>
<s> recommend a room on a higher floor ; it 's quieter and has better views. </s>
<s> NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL ! I made my reservation early and got there on time ; but the receptionist claimed that my room was occupied ! I guess it was some kind of glitch in the system ; but for a frequent business traveller like me this is absolutely unacceptable. </s>
<s> argued with the receptionist for a good half-hour and finally she was able to bring up my original reservation. </s>
<s> this ; it took me another half-hour to convince her ' and the manager ! to give me a different room ; since I had nowhere else to stay. </s>
<s> ; I get a key to a room they had on reserve ' I guess that 's how this whole thing started ; huh ! So I make my way to the 5th floor. </s>
<s> find what is supposed to be my new room. </s>
<s> open the door. </s>
<s> on the floor. </s>
<s> do the dinosaur. </s>
<s> Chicago - First off ; I 'd like to say that the Allegro is a fine hotel and you would n't be doing wrong by staying there. </s>
<s> ; with all the great hotels in the Chicago area ; you could certainly do better. </s>
<s> Allegro has all the amenities you 'd expect from a 4 star hotel ; and the price is nice ; but as they say " The devil is in the details " and its these details that Allegro fails to measure up to its competitors in. </s>
<s> of all ; the Allegro does n't provide an airport shuttle ; which is a convenience a tourist really should n't have to do without ; especially at a 4 star hotel. </s>
<s> stayed in a King Premier room and while the room itself was of decent size ; the bathroom was quite small. </s>
<s> also did n't like the blue and gold decor theme they had going on ; but that really is just personal taste. </s>
<s> be fair ; my stay there was pleasant ; and really a hotel mainly exists to serve as a place to rest when visiting somewhere ; but for around the same amount of money ; you could do much better. </s>
<s> booked this hotel using points on our credit card. </s>
<s> we arrived ; we were immediately greeted by a friendly face. </s>
<s> arrived several hours before check-in. </s>
<s> ; they let us check-in early. </s>
<s> also gave us a free room upgrade. </s>
<s> hotel is absolutely stunning ! In addition ; it is off of State Street. </s>
<s> are many things to do - shopping ; dinning ; theater. </s>
<s> is also close to public transportation if you would like to go to the United Center or the airport. </s>
<s> hotel also allowed us to have a late check-out at no additional charge. </s>
<s> room was so dark and quiet we slept in. </s>
<s> Hilton Chicago was amazing ! It is close to almost everything that Chicago has to offer ! We could walk to Lake Michigan ; Grant Park ; Niketown ; Watertower place ; etc. </s>
<s> rooms were very nice and refreshed every day. </s>
<s> ; they allow pets ! You do n't have to go far to get good food because they have a few different restaurants right there ! Overall experience was an A. </s>
<s> atmosphere at the Talbott Hotel is very welcoming when you first walk in. </s>
<s> employees are friendly and will greet you when you first arrive. </s>
<s> hotel seems to be luxurious ; even from the lobby ; and right away ; I was very excited for my stay ! I stayed in a double queen room with my friend. </s>
<s> room is spacious enough ; and beds are very comfortable. </s>
<s> did n't try the room service ; but they do have a fitness club close by with a spa ; which is very convenient. </s>
<s> also love how the room has individual climate controls ! Very neat ! Also handy that there is an iHome in the room. </s>
<s> 'm usually stuck using just a regular alarm clock radio at other hotels. </s>
<s> will most likely stay in this hotel another time. </s>
<s> was a wonderful experience ! I have to agree that the InterContinental Chicago is a nice hotel from the outside. </s>
<s> it is not a nice place to stay if you are planning to visit Chicago. </s>
<s> ambience of the hotel looks bland and they also have the same amenities as other cheaper hotels. </s>
<s> can get an excellent dining experience somewhere for less. </s>
<s> hotel has the worst rooms we have stayed in during the last 10 years. </s>
<s> first room they gave us was a shock. </s>
<s> and the bathroom was a joke ; ; you had to step inside ; move out of the way just to shut the door. </s>
<s> furniture is disgusting and all the wood trim was VERY beat up and painted over about 100 times. </s>
<s> they transfered us to the ' executive suite That room had a tiny bathroom . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
I mean TINY ! The furniture was hideous and dirty. </s>
<s> was on the 3rd level so you heard every conversation on the street below and traffic was loud. </s>
<s> only impressive part is the lobby . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  but do n't be fooled. </s>
<s> because after that . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
the floors above look like they need a major overhaul . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  and the rooms were not worth even $ 100 per night. </s>
<s> stayed there a year ago because we got stuck through Priceline deal. </s>
<s> do n't think we want to do Priceline again only because they have the Knickerbocker as a 4 star Hotel and we do n't ever want to go back there again. </s>
<s> Stars at best for the dumpy Knickerbocker. </s>
<s> should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing guests to stay in those rooms. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; IL The Hilton Chicago boasts to be one of the greats but falls into a cliche of a hotel. </s>
<s> are many different rooms with a supposed array of choices from King with two bathrooms ; Lakeside view or suites. </s>
<s> only looks good on paper that is until you get your bill. </s>
<s> will pay a huge fee for what seems like a nice upgrade but gives you nothing in return ! The staff is nice but when I stay at a hotel I do not go out of my way to seek out the staff. </s>
<s> casual dining atmosphere might be nice for a college couple looking for a getaway but it will not be cheap. </s>
<s> time I stay in Chicago I will be looking elsewhere. </s>
<s> have stayed at the James a few times ; it is my go to hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> last trip makes me think it is time to start looking for other options. </s>
<s> Good : Location is awesome ; just off Michigan Ave ; Trader Joe 's across street for some healthier snacking. </s>
<s> is a great location ; easy to walk most anywhere. </s>
<s> door staff are very friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> overall feeling is modern ; upbeat. </s>
<s> down service with cookie is nice. </s>
<s> Wifi ' which worked to varying degrees throughout stay The Bad : They claim to be a 4. </s>
<s> star hotel ; which to me ; means better then a 4 star and online with a 5 star ' without a pool. </s>
<s> used to have Kiehls toiletries and now have " Harmony " brand. </s>
<s> ; they now have the large bottles attached to the wall which you get to share with the other guests that stayed in the room before you. </s>
<s> is what I would expect from Holiday Inn or my gym ; but not a 4. </s>
<s> star hotel. </s>
<s> asked about the switch ' mainly because when I booked they still had Kiehls in website description and they claimed that the reason they went the communal bottle route was to be " green " . </s>
<s> is hard to believe ; as it 's not like the hotel is making other efforts to be green ' they still have incandescent light bulbs ; housekeeping leaves the lights and radio on when they do turn down ; they do n't recycle in room ; etc. </s>
<s> are obviously trying to cut costs ; and it shows. </s>
<s> : the rooms are in need of some updating ; they are looking somewhat tired. </s>
<s> third floor room was quite loud with the motorcyclers trying to prove their manhood out front ' not their fault. </s>
<s> n't take the stairs ' as the stairwell is straight out of horror movie ; even though the wait for one of the two elevators might be awhile. </s>
<s> phone staff was fairly rude ' granted ; they did n't like me questioning their toiletry change. </s>
<s> feel bad giving such a low rating ; but it really did not come close to my expectations ' from previous stays there. </s>
<s> will start trying out new hotels in the area. </s>
<s> hotel was everything we were looking for. </s>
<s> mom and I were on a girls weekend out shopping trip and just needed a place to stay after a long day out. </s>
<s> Talbott Hotel was incredible. </s>
<s> rooms were very clean and spacious and had everything we needed. </s>
<s> hotel check in was easy and the guest services folks were awesome ! They even gave us tips on great restaurants in the area. </s>
<s> recommend this hotel on your next trip to chicago ! The location was good. </s>
<s> was ok. </s>
<s> for non smoking room ; given floor with half smoking half non smoking. </s>
<s> could smell the smoke as soon as the elevator doors opened. </s>
<s> asked for and recieved a room on a non-smoking floor. </s>
<s> did not bring up the key ; we had to go down to the lobby to get it. </s>
<s> could have had some healthy choices ; the sweet rolls and danish were not fresh. </s>
<s> not ripe. </s>
<s> only had ONE wash cloth ; had to call down for more. </s>
<s> NEVER showed up at our room. </s>
<s> for turndown service ; not for the morning clean - up. </s>
<s> down upon our arrival back to our room after being gone all day and we were accused of putting our the Do Not Disturb sign. </s>
<s> said they would come up and they never came when they said they would. </s>
<s> finally told them not to come because of the time. </s>
<s> wanted to get ready to go out for dinner. </s>
<s> greeted by anyone as we came and went. </s>
<s> have stayed at the Peninsula and the Burnham. </s>
<s> Burnham was booked during our stay or I would have stayed there. </s>
<s> will NEVER stay at this hotel again ; Not worth 300. </s>
<s> a night My husband and I arrived at the Swissotel Chicago to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary. </s>
<s> automatically thought our experience would be nice because the pictures on the website and the hotel 's brochure intrigued us. </s>
<s> were wee wrong ! Upon arrival ' at the given and advertised check-in time our room was not ready. </s>
<s> waited for more than an hour ; with our bags in hand. </s>
<s> checked more than twice to see if the room was ready ; but the staff was less than " warm " both times. </s>
<s> a few frowns and mumbles from the people at the desk in the hotels lobby ; tired and finally arriving to our room ; we expected to take a nap and hit the city. </s>
<s> reserved the premier Corner King or so we thought. </s>
<s> were supposed to be able to see the lakes and rivers and the skyline. </s>
<s> ; right ! All we saw were the brick side of the other side of the building. </s>
<s> addition ; the water in the shower had little pressure. </s>
<s> called the front desk ; the phone rang for 21 times before someone answered. </s>
<s> husband said that he thinks that they knew we were the people calling. </s>
<s> requested a better room ; but they said that none was available. </s>
<s> ; they did have an upgraded room ; but we would have to pay some sort of upgrade fee. </s>
<s> could not believe it. </s>
<s> husband felt that we should not " agitate " them any further ; for fear that they might make things even worse for us : like turn off our air. </s>
<s> threw on some more jeans and headed fro the coffee shop around the corner that had given us refuge before. </s>
<s> returning about 2 hours later ; the water pressure was fixed. </s>
<s> room was clean and the bed was plush ; but the overall experience ' especially the rudeness of the staff was not good. </s>
<s> 's just say that on our next 13th anniversary we wo n't stay at the Swissotel and will tell others to not stay there. </s>
<s> checked in at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago shortly after dinner on Tuesday ; I was greeted by very frendly staff from the valet service to front desk. </s>
<s> can tell people were happy at the hotel. </s>
<s> was pleasantly surprised when I got to my room. </s>
<s> room was very well decorated and well thought out. </s>
<s> furniture was in the right location and there was lots of space. </s>
<s> it was convenient with lots of power outlets The bedroom and washroom was very clean and I had a great sleep in their very comfortable bed. </s>
<s> was told by front desk i could choose from 6 different pillows ; although i did not take advantage of this offer i thought what a great idea. </s>
<s> in a while you come across hotels with great service ; well thought out rooms in a perfect location ' right off Magnificent Mile. </s>
<s> visiting Chicago again I will definitely try and stay at Affinia again My stay at The Palmer House Hilton was less than satisfactory. </s>
<s> would have expected much for from such a " high end " hotel. </s>
<s> rooms were way over priced ; and the service was less than satisfactory. </s>
<s> one point ; I left my dirty towels on the floor to be picked up ; and when room service came through ; they were still there ! On the other side of things ; the cup I had left on my desk ' which I was planning to use later was gone. </s>
<s> coffee and my towels were also never replaced. </s>
<s> also was astounded that internet service did not come with the price of the room. </s>
<s> ; it was a " nominal fee " . </s>
<s> paying so much for a room ; I had hoped to at least have complimentary wifi. </s>
<s> stay at the Palmer House Hilton left much to be wished for. </s>
<s> will not be staying there again. </s>
<s> - My family and I stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago recently and we absolutely LOVED it ! Everything from the big flat screen TV in the room to the comfortable bedsheets and steam shower made it a wonderful stay. </s>
<s> was a fully equipped gym that me and husband used everyday while the kids spent a lot of their time playing the pool. </s>
<s> it was a great stay and I strongly recommend others to stay here as well ! This hotel has a good name and a good location in Chicago. </s>
<s> I was very unsatisfied with this hotel. </s>
<s> is a luxury hotel ; so you are paying luxury prices. </s>
<s> ; I expect to get my money 's worth. </s>
<s> that was not the case at the InterContinental. </s>
<s> ; my room was surprisingly small and unclean and could probably use a renovation and an upgrade in the furniture. </s>
<s> ; this is supposed to be a luxury hotel ; and it 's expensive. </s>
<s> should n't be worried about why the carpet and other parts of the room seem dirty. </s>
<s> also had trouble getting the room to the temperature I wanted. </s>
<s> 'm not sure if there was just a problem with the air condition in my room or if it 's a problem in the whole hotel. </s>
<s> building is old and I suppose it has a lot of problems from being old. </s>
<s> ; I was disappointed with the quality of the service from the hotel 's staff. </s>
<s> thought they were somewhat rude and inattentive. </s>
<s> ; this hotel has a lot of additional expenses. </s>
<s> felt like they wanted to overcharge me every chance they got ' use of the fitness amenities ; internet ; etc. </s>
<s> I 'm already paying so much for a hotel room ; I get very irritated when I feel I 'm being nickel-and-dimed every chance they get. </s>
<s> hotel has a nice looking building ; and again ; it 's in a terrific location. </s>
<s> I really do n't think it 's worth the expense. </s>
<s> are so many other hotels in Chicago to choose from that are so much better. </s>
<s> at the Sofitel was one of the less pleasurable experiences I have had in Chicago. </s>
<s> entering ; there was no one offered to take my luggage so I was forced to carry it up to the check in desk. </s>
<s> front desk staff was not friendly or welcoming. </s>
<s> room was smaller than I expected and smelled of fake suede. </s>
<s> decided to have drink and some food in Le Bar and upon entering ; I immediately noticed how dimly lit the room was. </s>
<s> could barely see the bartenders face. </s>
<s> drinks were alright and the food was sub-par compared to what I was expecting. </s>
<s> an hour ; I was ready for bed so I returned to my room to lay down. </s>
<s> mattress was surprising stiff. </s>
<s> noise was higher than expected as well. </s>
<s> ; it was only a one night stay. </s>
<s> stayed at the Omni between Christmas and New Year 's in 2008 just to get away for a few days. </s>
<s> found it through web deals and got a penthouse suite very cheap. </s>
<s> this year we checked online just a day or so after Christmas and the deal was there again. </s>
<s> also included parking at the great price. </s>
<s> suite overlooking downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> location to walk EVERYWHERE. </s>
<s> 12 and 11 yr olds loved swimming at night and the chocolate cookies on their pillows. </s>
<s> n't wait to go back. </s>
<s> recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to attend a corporate meeting. </s>
<s> say the rooms at this beautifully renovated hotel are stylish is an understatement. </s>
<s> stayed in one of the more moderately priced rooms yet found all the amenities of premium rooms at other hotels. </s>
<s> room was spacious and furnished in a retro-modern style. </s>
<s> fully stocked refreshment center ; wet bar ; and LCD HD TV were amongst the standard items. </s>
<s> Allegro is in the center of everything ; the Chicago Loop of the financial district ; the Chicago Theatre district ; great shopping on Slate Street and fine dinning is available adjacent to the hotel ' I suggest the 312 Lunch Club. </s>
<s> fitness room is well equipped and clean. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> we arrive at the 35th floor and my oh my ! SURPRISE ! ladies and gentlemen THIS is something to be admired . </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> spacious and roomy ; yet warm ; cozy and inviting . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> great bed ; comfortable furniture ; great 42 inch plasmas ; and the views are UNBELIEVABLE . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> my only complaint ? a shower should have a door to keep the heat IN . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> other than that no complaints ; room service was great ; morning coffee was yummo . </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> overall a fabulous experience ! Hotel Allegro - My boyfriend and I recently convened in Chicago for our 6 year anniversary ; we decided to stay at Hotel Allegro and it was the best decision we could have made. </s>
<s> welcomed us with open arms ; and their rooms were huge with very clean sheets. </s>
<s> were able to eat at 312 Chicago ; which is an Italian restaurant with to die for Ravioli. </s>
<s> booked our stay with the No Taxation without Libations promotion ; so we were able to have cocktails and a meal in the Encore Liquid Lounge for a GREAT value. </s>
<s> in all the staff gave us the five star treatment we were not expecting ; due to our young age ; and I will definitely be returning to this hotel. </s>
<s> travel often and whenever I travel I prefer to stay at Hilton properties. </s>
<s> am always satisfied with my stay at Hilton. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; I have never stayed at a Homewood Suites location. </s>
<s> property was awesome and it was great to have the same satisfication when I arrived. </s>
<s> lobby area was excellent and the greeting from the front desk staff was wonderful ! My room was in great condition ! Absolutely no complaints. </s>
<s> just figured that a property like this should be recognized. </s>
<s> job staff ! I will definitely return in the future ! I love the Ambassador East ; true ; she 's a little old but she 's a classic treasure. </s>
<s> service is wonderful ; from the minute you arrive you are greeted warmly and with a nice welcome ! I felt the service was good ; room was clean and quiet and that all the staff was very accomodating. </s>
<s> biggest gem is the Pump Room bar and restaurant. </s>
<s> best drinks ; amazing food ; exciting photographs and fun music on the weekends. </s>
<s> is set in the most fabulous location ; historical neightborhood ; close to walk the lakefront ; well known hometown bars ; excellent restaurants Chicago has to offer and most of all shopping. </s>
<s> was a nice street market going on over the summer-fall weekends ; giving this area a real interesting flavor of Chicago. </s>
<s> can see it needs some updating but I was totally happy and content with my stay. </s>
<s> travel a great deal in my work and have seen all kinds of hotels. </s>
<s> will stay here again in the future. </s>
<s> decided to spend a little extra to stay at this hotel while visiting our son in Chicago. </s>
<s> n't make that mistake again. </s>
<s> rooms are smaller than they appear on the web ' creative photography and the place is dirty. </s>
<s> 've stayed at Best Westerns that are cleaner ! The air conditioner is super loud . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  and the walls are paper thin. </s>
<s> people in the next room must have been having a party and despite three calls to the front desk between 1 and 3 a. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; Security failed to stop the ruckus. </s>
<s> thought the front desk staff was rude. </s>
<s> in Hyatts ; Hiltons ; etc. </s>
<s> ; the staff is polite and tries to be accommodating. </s>
<s> people were n't particularly personable . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  we seemed to be an interruption of their work rather than the reason for it. </s>
<s> only positive about the hotel was the location -- but that does n't make up for the negative experience. </s>
<s> some money and stay somewhere else ! This is a great hotel but there is no way that I would recommend it until the construction around it is complete. </s>
<s> elevator is the alley starts for the construction site behind at 5 : 30am and goes on into the night. </s>
<s> filling and emptying also seems to go on 24 '7. </s>
<s> of all ; the restaurant is open to the sidewalk cafe here and the rats go scampering from the construction next door to street to grating. </s>
<s> ! My husband and I arrived for a 3 night stay for our 10th wedding anniversary. </s>
<s> had booked an Executive Guest room ; upon arrival we were informed that they would be upgrading us to a beautiful Junior Suite. </s>
<s> was just a wonderful unexpected plus to our beautifully planned weekend. </s>

<s> grooming was perfect ; the daycare service we felt completely comfortable with. </s>
<s> was a beautiful weekend ; thank you Affinia Hotels ! We would visit this hotel again ! homewood suites chicago - Nice hotel. </s>
<s> paid about $ 300 'night for the weekend. </s>
<s> room was large and comfortable ; and a breakfast buffet was included ; which helped offset the pricey room There 's supposed to be a free dinner included too ; but it only runs on the weekdays ; so I never got to try it. </s>
<s> you 're staying through the week that may help justify the price ; too. </s>
<s> only complaint was the noise during the night ; but I suppose there 's only so much you can do in a big city. </s>
<s> I ever have to go back to Chicago ; I 'd definitely consider staying there again. </s>
<s> got back from three nights at the Knickerbocker. </s>

<s> stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower could not have been more luxurious ! Our room had anything you could ever want ; a mini bar ; air conditioning. </s>
<s> were also within walking distance of many sites and fun restaurants. </s>

<s>  cool off. </s>
<s> first night was interrupted by a phone call at one A. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> was a fax ; it happened 4 times. </s>
<s> this time we realized that the air was not working again ; so after fussing with the controls it did kick on. </s>
<s> next morning I mentioned to the concierge the issues with the phone ; but did n't think to mention the issues with the air because it appeared to be working. </s>
<s> being out seeing the sites of Chicago for several hours and being very hot we were looking forward to resting in a cool room before going to a show . </s>
<s> room was 78 degrees ; I called and maintenience did come to check. </s>
<s> determining that the unit needed a motor it was another hour so we did not get to rest in a cool room before going out. </s>
<s> feel an offer should have been made to us by the hotel. </s>
<s> was very surprised that WiFi was not a free service ! We will not be staying at the Hilton on our next trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary this past weekend. </s>

<s> decor of our room was very modern and eclectic with hues of blue and white ; and lighting that complimented and set the mood. </s>
<s> bar and lounge areas had excellent service ; and the views from our room perfectly captured the excitement of downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> ; my husband and I were extra pleased to learn that because we are AAA members ; we would be receiving 20 % off our room rate for the weekend. </s>
<s> ; the amenities and experience of staying at the Hotel Allegro Chicago made us feel like movie stars ; pampered and taken care of all weekend in a classy establishment ; one in which we would definitely choose to stay again. </s>
<s> at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and it was not a good experience. </s>
<s> room had been cleaned in a haphazardly fashion and was not pleasant to walk into. </s>
<s> I called the service desk for more towels to be brought up into the room ; it took an exceedingly long amount of time for them to be brought up ; and the woman who delivered the towels was as rude as can be. </s>

<s> stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was extremely relaxing and pleasant. </s>
<s> enjoyed the location. </s>
<s> could easily walk to the Red line or access the bus lines along Michigan Avenue. </s>

<s> State Street and Dearborn. </s>
<s> walked to 3rd Coast Cafe ; the Chicago History Museum ; and Second City from our hotel. </s>

<s> would choose to stay there again even if we could afford more expensive locations downtown. </s>
<s> definitely enjoyed the neighborhood feel of the place. </s>
<s> Omni is in a fabulous location on Michigan Avenue. </s>
<s> just blocks are all types of stores ; including Saks ; Nordstroms ; H 'M ; Filenes Basement ; Macys ; La Perla ; Apple ; Bloomingdates . </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> I could go on and on ! The room itself was fabulous. </s>
<s> ; nice big flat screen tvs ; nice sized bathroom. </s>
<s> charge for Wi-Fi ; but we found if we clicked yes on joining their guest program we could then go from the sign-on screen right to our email without actually completing the registration. </s>
<s> got this hotel for $ 214 'night through Priceline and felt it was a terrific deal ! We really enjoyed our stay at the Palmer House Hilton. </s>
<s> were in Chicago for a weekend stay ; and wanted something close to State Street ; and convenient to the theatre district and the museums ; and Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> shopping. </s>
<s> is a grand old hotel ; with just about every amenity one could wish for. </s>
<s> lobby is fabulous ; and the hotel also has some nice restaurants . </s>
<s> room had a nice king sized bed ; and was pretty cozy. </s>
<s> employees were very nice and helpful to us. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend this hotel if you want a " grand hotel " type experience at a reasonable price for the many amenities and in a very convenient spot in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> will definitely feel special. </s>
<s> you are traveling anywhere near Lake Michigan within the next year or less ; I would highly recommend staying at The Sofitel Hotel. </s>
<s> elegance ; fine dining ; and magnificent views are only just a few amenities to speak of. </s>
<s> with excellent service and reasonable pricing you will be assured to get a quality nights rest. </s>
<s> there were such a thing as a 10 star rating ; The Sofitel would surely have it. </s>
<s> visit and stay there was nothing short of elegance and comfort. </s>
<s> minutes from everything in downtown Chicago ; one would hardly want to leave. </s>
<s> dining ; dancing ; and an evening bar will leave you absolutely relaxing after any meeting ; or social event in town. </s>
<s> Sofitel Hotel will leave you wanting to visit the moment you leave. </s>
<s> stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers on a recent trip to Chicago ; and had a great stay. </s>
<s> rooms were beautiful ; the beds comfortable ; and the views of the city were fantastic. </s>
<s> room overlooked the river and the city. </s>
<s> felt like I was on a luxury vacation. </s>
<s> hotel has a few different restaurants. </s>
<s> ate at the Chicago Burger Company ; which was delicious. </s>
<s> burgers were juicy ; and the prices were great. </s>
<s> indoor pool was a great way for me to relax and entertain the kids in between sightseeing activities. </s>
<s> ; I had a wonderful stay. </s>
<s> husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad ; unfortunately ; we would never stay in this hotel again. </s>
<s> rooms looked nice ; but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink. </s>
<s> room service cost was super high - costing us over $ 100 for 1 burger ; 1 order of french toast ; 2 pops and 2 desserts. </s>
<s> the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake. </s>
<s> called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room ' we were on the 5th floor ; same as the reception desk. </s>
<s> did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower. </s>
<s> staff was friendly enough ; but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems. </s>
<s> was not even a coffee pot in the room. </s>
<s> would NOT stay here again for the price. </s>
<s> worth it ! I recently stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for two night ; and my visit was nothing short of disappointing. </s>
<s> to have a wonderfully romantic weekend with my fiance ; we specifically chose this hotel because we prefer boutique hotels for the extra attention from the staff and unique atmosphere. </s>
<s> expectations for the Ambassador were not met. </s>
<s> room was small and ; frankly ; outdated. </s>
<s> bathroom smelled musty. </s>
<s> A 'C in the room had two settings : polar cold or off. </s>
<s> walls did nothing to muffle sound from adjacent rooms ; and it was loud at night - a good night 's sleep was impossible. </s>
<s> were indifferent. </s>
<s> yourself a favor and avoid this hotel. </s>
<s> ; it 's not worth the steep price and mediocre character. </s>
<s> there are far better and more accommodating boutique hotels in Chicago ; I know I wo n't be back at this place. </s>
<s> booked this trip several months in advance and were greatly looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago. </s>
<s> ; our experience was significantly different from what we expected ; for the following reasons. </s>
<s> of all ; there was only one person at the front desk when we arrived. </s>
<s> person was preoccupied with something on their computer so our presence was not acknowledged for several minutes. </s>
<s> when we got to our room ; there were beautiful drapes in the window and across one entire wall but I found them to be incredibly dusty. </s>
<s> bumping into them slightly caused a cloud of dust to emerge which I found distasteful. </s>
<s> it was a good stay but those two inconveniences made us question the amount of money we paid for it. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago in Chicago ; Illinois. </s>
<s> must say ; that staying at this hotel is like staying at a high end hotel for celebrities. </s>
<s> are spa packages ; room service ; and the hotel is decorated extremely beautifully. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking to be treated like a star. </s>
<s> take reservations ; and also have a great restaurant right inside of the building. </s>
<s> you need ; they will accommodate you. </s>
<s> is heaven on earth ! I would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel ; even if its for one day ; its worth it. </s>
<s> is an absolutely exquisite hotel ; at a great location ; and boasting superb amenities. </s>
<s> was here on a personal trip and really enjoyed being so close to the shopping on Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> hotel itself has a pleasant ambiance and the staff made me feel welcome and quickly responded to my requests for various items from the front desk. </s>
<s> appreciated the homey ; well-designed interior and views of the city. </s>
<s> was also nice to have good food at my disposal late night so I did n't have to wander the city for my late night meal. </s>
<s> will definitely be my hotel of choice when I return to the city. </s>
<s> was really excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading several reviews online. </s>
<s> ; it was a very disappointing experience. </s>
<s> we arrived ; we were told that there was a mistake and the hotel was oversold. </s>
<s> ; we had to move to another hotel. </s>
<s> did take care of the other hotel ; cab fare ; and after much negotiating . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> breakfast. </s>
<s> were traveling with 2 children and all of this was very inconvenient. </s>
<s> of getting up the next morning and going to the museum as we had planned ; we had to get up ; pack up our suitcases ; check out of the hotel ; take a cab ; check back into the Amalfi ; only then could we head to the museum. </s>
<s> were also told that our first night 's stay would be refunded. </s>
<s> ; more than 3 weeks and 3 phone calls later . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there still has n't been a refund. </s>
<s> ca n't even get a manager to call me back. </s>
<s> Amalfi was n't all bad ; it is centrally located close to train and bus stops and has many restaurants within walking distance. </s>
<s> coctail reception had a nice selection of drinks and appetizers. </s>
<s> ; it was in a very small room and there was no place to sit both nights we attended. </s>
<s> reason we picked the Amalfi was that it had 2 queen beds instead of doubles ; but they seemed really small for queens. </s>
<s> view from our room was of the alley. </s>
<s> ; overall the best part of staying at the Amalfi was the night that we were sent to another hotel and had a wonderful view of the city from the 22nd floor. </s>
<s> disappointing indeed ! First let me say ; I try not to be too critical ; but in some cases the truth is warranted ! We checked in and things seemed fine. </s>
<s> was excellent. </s>
<s> up the first morning ; to a slightly rumpled bed covered in " stains " ; I hope-filthy and not 4 star hotel quality. </s>
<s> a linen change and heard a knock on the door- a gentleman was there to let me know if I wanted it done to take off the privacy sign ; I did and no one even came until later in the day. </s>
<s> room was big enough ; had no drawers ; suposedly remodeled but carpet did n't reach the wall ; toilet paper holder fell off constantly and shower head was broken. </s>
<s> mirrors were great and the water was always hot ! The walls were paper thin ; I heard every conversation the guests next door had. </s>
<s> were not noisy but you could hear everything including the t. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> through the walls and vents. </s>
<s> was $ 13. </s>
<s> ; worked for a bit and then not again ; I called customer service and spent 25 minutes on the phone and they asked if they could work on resetting the system and call back later. </s>
<s> hotel did give us a credit for the charges. </s>
<s> this point ; enough was enough ; we packed our bags and checked out. </s>
<s> front desk was very helpful- kudos to Rocco for caring and being the only friendly staff we saw other than the bell hops ! The Omni Chicago Hotel is amazing little get away right on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel is warm and homey as well as modern and filled with amenities ! The beds are very comfortable and there are flat screen televisions in the rooms ' at least both times I have stayed. </s>
<s> Windy City Spa provides a relaxing getaway as well. </s>
<s> indoor pool provides something fun for all ages and the customer service was excellent. </s>
<s> garage was very secure and has unlimited in 'out priviledges which made it nice to be able to access the car as much as you wanted without any penalty. </s>
<s> in all ; well worth it and will plan to stay again ! Fairmont - I would not recommend the Fairmont. </s>
<s> decided to spend a little extra and get the Fairmont Gold room while on a business trip and I sincerely regret it. </s>
<s> ; there is a good amount of space and the bathroom is huge ; but is that really necessary for one or even two people ? Plus ; they make no mention of the charge for wi-fi until you get the bill at the end of your stay. </s>
<s> ? I get free wi-fi with a 1$ cup of coffee ; but not with my 380$ night at the Fairmont ? Ridiculous Recently stayed at the James Chicago and will NOT be returning anytime soon. </s>
<s> staff is unfriendly to say the least and the prices are outrageous. </s>
<s> not a fan of the fact they allow pets as guests. </s>
<s> was n't enough space in the gym and the lack of variety in equipment limits your options severely. </s>
<s> i was very unimpressed with the services as a whole and would recommend you avoid this establishment. </s>
<s> was visiting relatives in Chicago and wanted to stay in a hotel that emphasized luxury and was also environmentally friendly ; and the Talbott seemed to fit the bill. </s>
<s> also could n't help but notice all the positive reviews online. </s>
<s> figured I could n't go wrong and I am happy to report the positive reviews are true. </s>
<s> of all check in was a breeze. </s>
<s> love their online reservation system. </s>
<s> was easy to use and the information presented was quick and accurate. </s>
<s> I arrived in Chicago I was greeted by Tim at the door and I immediately felt like wanted and liked. </s>
<s> receptionist was very polite and when she heard I was visiting Chicago for the first time ; she upgraded my Deluxe King to an Executive King. </s>
<s> ! The room was just as advertised ; luxurious and convenient. </s>
<s> was also exceptionally clean and this is very important to me because I am paranoid of germs and bed bugs. </s>
<s> importantly though ; I got a good night 's sleeep because the bed and pillows were super soft ; but firm enough to help support my back. </s>
<s> also used the Equinox Fitness Club and ; wow ; what a club. </s>
<s> is another great amenity of the Talbott and easily beats other hotels skimpy workout centers. </s>
<s> check-out was quick ; easy ; and painless. </s>
<s> hotel gets my highest recommendation. </s>
<s> facilities are immaculate and modern with the recent upgrade ; the staff is ultra-friendly and competent ; and the location was perfect for my needs. </s>
<s> with a group for a bachelorette party ; and was disappointed. </s>
<s> hotel is beautiful ; the staff was all rather friendly. </s>
<s> main problem was the room 'sleeping situation. </s>
<s> had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before ; but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out ' how that happens I do n't know ! so they " upgraded " us to two " suites " with a king and a pull out. </s>
<s> ; this meant our party was split up and on different floors. </s>
<s> ; that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch. </s>
<s> I 'm not a picky ; unreasonable person ; but that was the WORST " bed " I 've ever slept on ! It was sunken in the middle so we literally rolled into each other unless we balanced ourselves on the very edge of the bed. </s>
<s> there were the springs poking into our backs ALL night ! Just awful ! For the amount of money we spent I expected to be comfortable ! I would not stay here again after this experience. </s>
<s> wife and I were excited to visit and shop at Chicago 's Magnificent Mile on Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> chose the Intercontinental Hotel for it 's reputation and location. </s>
<s> oh man ; were we disappointed. </s>
<s> check in was smooth enough even though the hotel was busy and all seemed well. </s>
<s> got ready to go out shopping and went to visit the concierge in the lobby to ask about suggestions and bargains. </s>
<s> were six people in line for her and we had to wait. </s>
<s> was no problem since we were n't on a timetable. </s>
<s> we finally got to her and asked about shopping on the Miracle Mile ; she just pointed to the door and said ; " It 's right out the door. </s>
<s> " 
I asked her for suggestions of the best stores for bargains and she rolled her eyes at me saying ; " there 's no such thing. </s>
<s> " 
I could n't believe her abruptness. </s>
<s> left the concierge stand not wanting to return. </s>
<s> went well and was fun. </s>
<s> returned to our room and wanted to look up a restaurant for the night ourselves rather than ask the concierge. </s>
<s> could n't find a hotel directory in the room. </s>
<s> called the Housekeeping Department and was told ; " we 're all out of directories here in the office. </s>
<s> " 
I asked if they could check a vacant room for one. </s>
<s> said the hotel was full and there were no vacant rooms. </s>
<s> hung up and thought I would just look for a restaurant in the yellow pages. </s>
<s> what ? You guessed it ; no phone book in the room. </s>
<s> figured we could go get a drink at The Bar ; the hotel 's 20 's themed lounge ; and ask the bartender for suggestions. </s>
<s> went to The Bar and there were only three other customers. </s>
<s> sat at the bar and got our drinks. </s>
<s> I was about to ask the bartender for restaurant suggestions ; his cell phone rang. </s>
<s> answered it and went to the other end of the bar to talk. </s>
<s> minutes later ; he was still on the phone. </s>
<s> and hungry ; my wife and I went back to our room and ordered a pizza to be delivered from Pizza Hut. </s>
<s> the hotel is nice enough and the furnishings comfortable ; the indifference of the staff will keep me from ever coming back. </s>
<s> big thumbs down to the Intercontinental Chicago. </s>
<s> need to look up the word hospitality in the dictionary. </s>
<s> stayed at the Fairmont two Saturday 's in a row ; and both stays were disappointing. </s>
<s> had to call the hotel prior to each stay and both times it took the hotel 30-40 minutes to answer their phone. </s>
<s> the price ; we expected nicer decor ' it looked cheaply done ; more comfortable beds-the mattresses were too soft and the sheets too hard-pillows were n't comfortable either ; a more accomodating front desk staff. </s>
<s> friends who were also there on the same dates will undoubtably add similar comments. </s>
<s> was apprehensive after reading some of the more negative reviews of the Hotel Allegro. </s>
<s> ; our stay there was without problems and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> room was not huge but there was plenty of room to move around without bumping into one another. </s>
<s> bathroom was small but well appointed. </s>
<s> ; it was a clean and interestingly decorated room and we were pleased. </s>
<s> have complained about being able to clearly hear people in adjacent rooms but we must have lucked out in that way and did not experience that although we could occasionaly hear people talking in the hallway. </s>
<s> other reviewer complained rather bitterly about the area and said that it was dangerous and I ca n't even begin to understand that as we found it to be extremely safe. </s>
<s> area is also very close to public transportation ' we used the trains exclusively and got around quite well without a car. </s>
<s> would most definetly stay here again and recommend it to others. </s>
<s> Suites - Stayed here for business and would not recommend. </s>
<s> were big and clean but lacked a desk or large enough table to get work done. </s>
<s> provide breakfast in the morning but refused to refill the buffet after food ran out. </s>
<s> sure to get there early or you will go hungry. </s>
<s> am going to stay away from the Homewood Suites next time I visit Chicago. </s>
<s> my husband and I stayed at The James in Chicago for our " night on the town " . </s>
<s> taking in a musical ; we checked in at The James and were happily surprised with the customer appreciation and delicious room service. </s>
<s> rooms were spotless and we were supplied with fresh towels for everything from showers to the spa to visiting the gym. </s>
<s> I had known that they accepted pets beforehand ; it would 've been a great environment for our family lapdog. </s>
<s> at The James in Chicago made our night a luxurious outing and will be a definite stop next time we are in Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel is almost always very helpful. </s>
<s> stay caused me to re-think if I like the Palmer House. </s>
<s> had dirty covers for the bed. </s>
<s> was also the smallest room in the hotel I am sure. </s>
<s> husband and I usually come 8 times each year. </s>
<s> is there doing Business and CTA work. </s>
<s> are not pleased with the size of the room at all now. </s>
<s> have always had two chairs ; desk ; and usually 22 by 25 feet. </s>
<s> this room on the 11th floor. </s>
<s> was only 15 X 17 approx. </s>
<s> service men at the doors have always said a welcome but not this time. </s>
<s> the past we had a bell man steal a $ 300. </s>
<s> of sun glasses and the hotel did nothing about our loss financially. </s>
<s> my boyfriend and I checked into our room at the Omni Chicago ; we were irritated to see that the bed looked rumpled ; as if kids had been jumping on it. </s>
<s> was just the first of our " issues " . </s>
<s> glasses in the bathroom had lipstick smears on them ; and I saw a ' dead-thank goodness ! roach behind the toilet. </s>
<s> were given the hotel night stay by a friend ; so we decided to just deal with it. </s>
<s> ordered some munchies from the kitchen ; and the chips were stale ; and the dip smelled sour. </s>
<s> coming back from the convenience store with beer and some fresh munchies ; we were able to enjoy our stay -- but I would not recommend this place to anyone ! Stayed at the Monaco on my way skiing at Easter loved it. </s>
<s> were helpful friendly ; room was huge with fantastic view of the river. </s>
<s> location ; 5 min walk to the EL. </s>
<s> Restaurant 'Bar ; great food service. </s>
<s> have stayed in more expensive ; supposedly better ; hotels in Chicago ; but this is the best. </s>
<s> Monaco ; I 'll be back. </s>
<s> n't ever stay at this hotel ! ; Conrad Chicago is the worst hotel you can imagine. </s>
<s> of all ; THE PRICE ! you not get what you pay for. </s>
<s> paid ' 217. </s>
<s> one night for a room that did not even had a TV ! that 's ridiculous ! The bathroom did not work ; and it was nasty ! the bed sheets seemed like used ; as if some people slept there and they smelled bad !

<s> get better service and accommodations even in a 1 star motel ! My stay at this hotel was one of the best I have ever had ! The location ; service and accommodations were all outstanding ! The lobby area is beautiful as was my room. </s>
<s> the room there was more than enough space ; which is difficult to find in Chicago hotels. </s>
<s> only gripe was the room was a little dark. </s>
<s> ; staying at a small ; upper-class hotel like the Talbott involves paying a premium but it was well worth it. </s>
<s> service was timely and everyone seemed friendly and informed. </s>
<s> room service took a bit longer than I would have liked ; however ; the food was good quality. </s>
<s> nice touch was the gym pass provided for guests at the Equinox Fitness Center. </s>
<s> ; the location is PERFECT ! It 's located in a beautiful area of the city near the Gold Coast ; which has many very good restaurants. </s>
<s> personal favorite of mine is Mario 's ; a nice Italian place nearby. </s>

<s> price is right and the staff are excellent. </s>
<s> noted ; there is construction going on around the hotel ; but I did n't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping. </s>

<s> ca n't say enough about how nice the staff are -- every single person you meet. </s>

<s> hotel is ok but is not the best for the money. </s>
<s> of all the parking prices are exorbitant. </s>
<s> know parking is at a premium for this location but the price is much too high. </s>
<s> ; the service at this hotel was poor. </s>
<s> felt like room service took too long and considering the price the service was poor in general ; and the staff at The Palmer House seemed more interested in helping the richer or more known customers more than us. </s>
<s> addition I feel that there were too many fees including a fee for internet. </s>
<s> the rooms were very clean and beds very nice but there was some noise and you could hear the people walking above you. </s>
<s> would say it was an average experience at this hotel and considering the price maybe think twice about The Palmer House. </s>

I would not recommend it to anyone Patrick For starters ; I had trouble reaching the front desk. </s>

<s> of Los Angelas ; California Hilton Chicago - It 's a bit pricey ; but that evil is somewhat unavoidable in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> 'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else in the area with accommodations as nice for the same price. </s>
<s> that set this hotel apart are its unconventional yet agreeable styling ; HD TV 's in all the rooms ; and scenic lake views from most of the rooms. </s>
<s> are two decent restaurants in the hotel ; but there 's plenty of other options like pizzerias ; a Thai place ; Jimmy John 's sandwiches ; and an upscale Italian restaurant called Gioco ' my personal choice easily within walking distance if you get bored of the main offerings. </s>
<s> 's about half an hour away from O 'Hare and only 15 minutes away from Midway International Airport ; so it 's pretty conveniently located if you happen to be a flyer. </s>

<s> after two nights of downtown Chicago fun we realized that The Talbott transcends it 's ritzy look and truly embraces a family friendliness which we thoroughly enjoyed. </s>
<s> had an issue with housekeeping and the hotel management did not handle it well. </s>
<s> were subject to a brief staff strike and did not inform guests and in fact failed to tell us about the strike and our room never was cleaned. </s>
<s> 4 calls and several hours we were able to get clean towels. </s>

<s> Chicago - I recently stayed for a night at the Fairmont while I was in Chicago for a job interview. </s>
<s> room was okay ; clean at least and with big windows ; but for some reason the bathroom did n't have a hairdryer ' important for me ; and a pretty standard amenity . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
I had to call the front desk and ask for one ; and then it took THREE HOURS for someone to bring it up. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  three hours ? Besides that ; things were decent ; pretty much what you 'd expect from any 4 star hotel. </s>

<s> stayed here while visiting friends and decided to treat myself to a luxury experience. </s>
<s> did not get it. </s>
<s> in was not a pleasant experience. </s>
<s> wait was long and the front desk staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. </s>
<s> room was ok ; no roaches or anything ; but it was small and cramped. </s>

<s> house cleaning service was really pushy and tried to clean my room at 8 : 30a in the morning. </s>
<s> I asked them to come back later ; they gave me a whole 15 minutes before they came back. </s>
<s> getting extra towels was like pulling teeth. </s>
<s> do n't know if they thought I was going to steal them or what. </s>
<s> room service food that I ordered was fine ; but it took forever to be delivered and was half-cold by the time I received it. </s>
<s> I called the front desk to complain ; they apologized ; but did not offer to compensate me or send me new food. </s>
<s> have a restaurant at the hotel ; but I did not bother to try it. </s>
<s> prices were ridiculous ; the menu was limited ; and my room service experience assured me it was not worth the hassel. </s>

<s> your hard-earned money somewhere else. </s>
<s> morning ; I checked out and left behind one of the worst hotel experiences I 've ever had : Hard Rock Hotel ; Chicago. </s>
<s> am in disbelief that this hotel is part of the " Preferred Hotels " group. </s>
<s> checking in ; I was " greeted " by a front desk staff that had better things to be doing and let it show. </s>

<s> desk 'desk chair was covered in sticky ; dried soda pop ' or something else ? which I had to clean myself so I could work. </s>

<s> in-room mini-bar policy ranks in my personal top-five most ridiculous business practices of all time. </s>
<s> you charge Steven Tyler $ 7. </s>
<s> for opening his in-room ' fridge ? Looking back ; I would have much preferred enjoying cocktails in my dirty room rather than the dirty ; drafty ; overpriced bar ' with a horrendous wine list With the exception of the fact that I was leaving ; check-out was no better than checking in. </s>
<s> was n't even asked about my stay ! The young woman who provided me with a copy of my bill could not have been more unpleasant. </s>
<s> ; for one ; will not bring my business back to that location. </s>
<s> time I 'm in Chicago ; I 'm staying at the Hyatt. </s>
<s> on ; TripStarr The James Chicago is a stuffy ; uninviting hotel. </s>
<s> you are looking for all of the comforts of home ; do not stay here. </s>

<s> not a child-friendly hotel. </s>
<s> restaurant on site is also very modern and screams pretentious. </s>
<s> would not vacation here again ; especially not with children. </s>
<s> were afraid to touch anything in the whole hotel ! We chose the Talbott Hotel primarily for the location ; but quickly discovered that the location was the only good thing about it. </s>
<s> their website did a good job of selling their services and amenities ; we found both severely lacking. </s>

<s> asked for ; and were promised ; a king room. </s>
<s> ; when we checked in ; we were told by the front desk clerk that no king rooms were available. </s>

<s> took the key for our double queen room and were on our way. </s>
<s> arriving on our floor ; we found a rowdy group of young girls running up and down the hallway ; squealing and playing. </s>
<s> turns out that this hotel offers American Girl visits for the nearby store. </s>
<s> turns out that our romantic getaway room was in the center of a block of rooms reserved for a Girl Scout troop on an American Girl trip ! We went back downstairs to request a move to another room ; and were told no other double queen rooms were currently available. </s>

<s> called down to the desk ; and they told us " they would take care of it " ; but the girls continued to have their party in the hallway anyway. </s>
<s> came to shoo them away. </s>
<s> next morning ; I turned on the hairdryer ; expecting it to work after reporting the difficulty the day before. </s>
<s> did n't ! Stuck wearing my clip again ; we checked out and made a mental note to select another hotel in the area for our next trip. </s>
<s> hotel had potential ; but the staff does n't care enough about your experience to allow me to recommend it to other travelers. </s>
<s> recently celebrated our 20th anniversary in Chicago and stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. </s>

<s> We were going on a dinner cruise-The Odyssey at Navy Pier The hotel is a short walk . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> unless you are wearing heels : to Navy Pier. </s>
<s> found out on the way home only a $ 5 cab ride : worth $ 20 to your blisters ! Its also only a short walk to Michigan Ave shopping . </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> for comfortable shoes perhaps ? ? I chose this hotel because of location ; but the views are also terrific. </s>

<s> very nice. </s>
<s> hotel is very nice. </s>
<s> restaurants ; although we have n't tried them. </s>
<s> burger place downstairs sure smelled good though : We ended up at Bubba Gumps at Navy Pier. </s>
<s> ! The rooms were very spacious and CLEAN ! I am kind of a germaphobe ! so clean is important for my sanity : The bottom level has doors that leads right out to the riverwalk ; and a cool water fountain. </s>
<s> I obviously highly recommend this hotel : I <3 CHICAGO I 've stayed at several different hotels in Chicago but The James is the best. </s>
<s> I need is in walking distance and I find it very convenient to stay there. </s>
<s> staff at the concierge desk is so polite and offers assistance willingly. </s>
<s> room has always been very clean. </s>
<s> bed linens are better that the nice sheets I have on my own bed. </s>
<s> I do n't have to search around for somewhere to stay when I travel there as I 've found my favorite. </s>
<s> stayed at the Omni hotel with my family on vacation in Chicago. </s>
<s> was a long queue at the front desk for checking in. </s>
<s> we finally got the room ; we were sad to see that the room was not clean. </s>
<s> items in the mini bar were very costly. </s>
<s> had a problem with the shower and calling the room service did not help. </s>
<s> beds were comfortable to sleep and the view of downtown from the room was great at night. </s>
<s> enjoyed the pool. </s>
<s> food at the restaurant was not so good and the service was bad. </s>
<s> ; the hotel did not live up to our expectations and somewhat ruined our vacation. </s>
<s> stayed at Palmer House for one night in early January this year. </s>
<s> the check in ; the front desk lady asked me to show my confirmation letter of my reservation. </s>
<s> did not bring the confirmation with me because I had not been asked to present it in other places during check in. </s>
<s> she asked to print out one copy in their business center and bring the confirmation to the bell station to get the room key. </s>
<s> did what she told me and went to the bell station. </s>
<s> ; people at the bell station was totally confused and none of them have the key. </s>
<s> bellman was nice enough to help me go ask their staff at the front desk. </s>
<s> finally got checked in after waiting at the lobby for about 15 minutes. </s>
<s> other people pointed out before ; the room I got was small and old with a twin bed ; and I could hear people next door using the bathroom. </s>
<s> was not a pleasant experience ; even though I paid over 100 dollars to the hotel. </s>
<s> was expecting an experience comparable to my stays at the Olympia in Seattle. </s>
<s> decor and overall feel of the hotel was much above average but not inspiring. </s>
<s> disappointment was the inadequate internet connection in the room. </s>
<s> wireless was very slow and the hard-wire from the wall did not work at all. </s>
<s> did request a replacement of the wall wire ; but it did no help. </s>
<s> hotel can do better than this. </s>
<s> a 5 star rating ; it should be an experience to be pleasantly remembered -- but ; was just a mediocre experience for me. </s>
<s> the bed covers were not that special. </s>
<s> more intense management. </s>

<s> room was seemingly nice at first ; but after staying there for a few days it seemed like the cleaning staff never came through to clean it. </s>
<s> had the same sheets for a three days before I called and requested they be changed. </s>
<s> ; the walls seem to be paper thin and you can hear what is going on in the adjacent rooms ; which interfered with my sleep. </s>
<s> ate at the primehouse in the restaurant also ; and asked for a well done steak ; and the steak was still pretty pink on the inside and lacked flavor. </s>
<s> is definitely not a hotel I would recommend to anyone. </s>
<s> wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in mid-October. </s>
<s> decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of Chicago in a week. </s>
<s> 'll start out by saying that this was a great experience. </s>
<s> check-in ; I indicated that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite. </s>
<s> Ambassador East is probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from the North end of the Magnificent Mile. </s>
<s> is also just a 2 or 3 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on Rush. </s>
<s> room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed. </s>
<s> suite ' on the 3rd floor had two very large closets ; a large " living room " and a large bedroom. </s>
<s> bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough. </s>
<s> I would have payed full price for this suite ; I probably would have given it a rating of 4 ; but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and I had such a great time here ; I decided to give it a five. </s>
<s> is also worth mentioning that the concierge was very helpful. </s>
<s> wife and I decided to eat at The Pump Room restaurant ; but we were not very impressed. </s>
<s> found the food and service mediocre. </s>
<s> atmosphere was probably pretty neat when Sinatra used to eat there back in the day ; but not anymore. </s>
<s> we were unimpressed by the Pump Room ; the staff were kind enough to seat us in the " Sinatra Booth " which was back in a corner and enclosed by curtains. </s>
<s> neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here. </s>
<s> Ambassador East is an older hotel ; but it is in a charming older neighborhood. </s>
<s> staff 's kindness and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me. </s>
<s> we are in Chicago again ; we will definitely consider staying at the Ambassador East again. </s>
<s> A rate with upgrade to view room was less than $ 200 which also included breakfast vouchers. </s>

<s> carpet was so stained it looked like it was suppose to be that way. </s>
<s> furniture was worn and outdated. </s>
<s> place was gross and just was n't worth the money we spent on it. </s>
<s> only redeeming quality was the door man ; we was very nice and helpful. </s>
<s> booked the Amalfi looking for a great boutique hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel is a nice property with clean rooms and nice amenities in a good location. </s>
<s> ; when i booked the hotel I was offered an upgraded room from a king room to a corner king room for only $ 10 more. </s>
<s> was great until I checked in. </s>
<s> corner room looked at two brick walls and an alley. </s>
<s> the night there were several homeless individuals fighting in the alley. </s>
<s> would seem that this is a place for them to congregate. </s>
<s> top of this ; the dumpsters in the alley were being emptied by the waste department between 5 and 6 am in the morning. </s>
<s> noise was crazy loud. </s>
<s> think this is a nice hotel with some unfortunate aspects due to its location. </s>
<s> staff is extremely friendly and very helpful. </s>
<s> a recent business trip to Chicago I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Allegro. </s>
<s> lobby gave a good first impression. </s>
<s> was a very clean with a modern designer 's feel and the customer service was great. </s>
<s> proceeded to the counter to check-in and within 5 minutes I had the key to my room. </s>
<s> was told to check out the infamous 312 restaurant but I was tired from my flight. </s>
<s> checked into my room. </s>
<s> room was great. </s>
<s> king size bed 37 " flat screen tv and standard desk all designer furniture. </s>
<s> I unpacked I had to check my email. </s>
<s> up to their Wi-Fi was quick and painless ! I had a good night sleep and early wake up the next day for my business meeting. </s>
<s> decided to try the restaurant for breakfast. </s>
<s> had an omelet and fruit. </s>
<s> restaurant was great and the food was perfect. </s>
<s> only wish I had more time to stay and enjoy lunch ; nevertheless duty called. </s>
<s> concierge had my taxi waiting for me right after breakfast and I was off to work. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. </s>
<s> 's one of the best I 've ever stayed at after multiple business trips. </s>
<s> that i read from other reviews was pretty much on the money ; they have excellent customer service ; the employees there really cared about their guests ; there was always coffee ; tea ; hot chocolate in the lobby ; good hot breakfast and dinner with wine and beer ; the doormen were nice and willing to help out for directions ; the room did the job ; there was a kitchen ; 2 flat screen tv 's ; and a pullout couch included ; it was close to the " eL " ; but for us we found the buses to be more useful. </s>
<s> would recommend getting a pass ; we got a 3 day pass and it was well worth it for $ 14 which we got at jewel osco ; not too far from the hotel ; for the most part the majority of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families ; but us three girls did n't mind ; so i would definitely recommend this place ; it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels. </s>
<s> enjoyed my stay at the Talbott Hotel. </s>
<s> is on the more expensive side ; but it is all worth it. </s>
<s> got the Talbott tradition package ; which was $ 245 for two people and included a $ 30 breakfast credit on check out day. </s>
<s> rooms are huge ! The beds are soft and comfortable. </s>
<s> include Aveda bath products ; which is a plus in my book. </s>
<s> also have a nice fitness area pool you can use while you stay there. </s>
<s> thing I thought was really cool is that you can forward your messages from your hotel room phone to your cell phone. </s>
<s> boyfriend also liked the Ihome audio system. </s>
<s> location of this hotel is very convenient as well ; its close to several great restaurants and blocks from the coast. </s>
<s> ; what I like best about this hotel is that they make an honest effort to not negatively impact the environment more than they need to. </s>
<s> were one of the first hotels to be Green Sealed. </s>
<s> I had a great stay at Talbott Hotel ! Striking architecture is only the beginning of what can only be described as one of the best hotel experiences of my professional life. </s>
<s> attention to detail in the room and the bathroom is remarkable and the bed is the best night 's sleep I 've ever experienced in a hotel. </s>
<s> LCD tv and Bose wave machine added to my enjoyment. </s>
<s> is worth the extra $ 's. </s>
<s> stay here was superb. </s>
<s> view from my windows was stunning ; as I looked out I could see the beautiful Grant Park. </s>
<s> room had a nice airy feel but was also warm and inviting. </s>
<s> bed was very comfortable. </s>
<s> wireless internet was fast and effective which is nice especially when on business trips. </s>
<s> hotel is in walking distance to the museum which is nice for those on vaca. </s>
<s> I thouroughly enjoyed my stay here. </s>
<s> Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago has it all : location ; comfort ; and rockability ! We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently and found it to be amazing ! The location was perfect as it is walking distance to the Magnificent Mile ; Navy Pier ; and Lake Michigan. </s>
<s> was just a short ride by bus or cab to the sports stadiums ; Shedd Aquarium or the Museum of Science and Industry ! The food ; although it was pricey ; was great ! There is a spa on site if you need a little time to relax and recoup after all that rockin ; and if you have pets ; they get the ROYAL treatment ; complete with gifts ! I would highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel of Chicago ! We enjoyed our stay at the James in Chicago very much. </s>
<s> hotel is elegant and uber-modern ! Each room simply exudes class. </s>
<s> have never stayed in a nicer hotel ; to be honest. </s>
<s> hotel features an upscale restaurant ; though it is within walking distance of many great dining establishments. </s>
<s> is also a full-service spa at the hotel. </s>
<s> most surprising thing about the James is that pets are allowed ; our dog did n't have to stay at home. </s>
<s> cool is that ? There are also lots of up-scale amenities like valet parking ; 24-hour room service ; 24-hour concierge ; shoe shine service ; and laundry 'dry cleaning. </s>
<s> hotel is located right on the Magnificent Mile ; so that location is absolutely superb. </s>
<s> are literally steps away from some of the best dining and shopping in the world. </s>
<s> would recommend the James to anyone on business or looking to stay in upscale luxury on a jaunt to Chicago. </s>
<s> loved our stay at the Talbott. </s>
<s> were in Chicago to attend the theater show Dirty Dancing. </s>
<s> booked our room through Orbitz and received a nice discount. </s>
<s> we arrived at the hotel everyone from the doorman to the front desk to the maids were highly professional and courtesy. </s>
<s> were upgraded to a King bed suite. </s>
<s> suite was well decorated and spacious. </s>
<s> wife particularily enjoyed the heat that could be directed at the marble floor in the bathroom. </s>
<s> loved the hotel and will definitely stay at the Talbott on our next trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> recommended. </s>
<s> stay at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago was without a doubt one of the worst hotel experiences in my live. </s>
<s> was there for a week long conference. </s>
<s> my reservations had been made months in advance ; they did not have a suite for me when I arrived ; resulting in having to stay in another hotel for the first night. </s>
<s> my room was ready ; I was disappointed by the cleanliness and the limitation of the kitchen : barely large enough to move around ; and very few utensils to cook with. </s>
<s> pool was only open for limited hours ; and I should not have bothered bringing a swimsuit. </s>
<s> night I was kept awake by the noise coming from adjacent rooms and the traffic outside. </s>
<s> overall experience was a stay in an overpriced suite. </s>
<s> will not book here ever again. </s>
<s> was looking forward to staying here for my wedding in late September ; and was surprised by the signs of hard times that were subtle ; but affected me and my husband. </s>
<s> example ; he got locked out of our room 2 times ; once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa. </s>
<s> other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony ; so that was stressful because he lost some time. </s>
<s> keycard just would stop working. </s>
<s> a fuse blew ; so we had no power while trying to get ready. </s>
<s> happened to me also ; coming back from the spa ; and I called on the hallway phone to get help. </s>
<s> ; right after that ; an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if I had been waiting long -- as if she knew this was a problem. </s>
<s> said no ; and she called down to check. </s>
<s> ; no one had even called Security to get me back into my room ! She had a set of keys and let me in ; thank god. </s>
<s> ; on our wedding night ; my husband wanted to order from room service. </s>
<s> was a little after 10 : 30pm. </s>
<s> were told that room service was closed for the night -- even though all the literature in the room brags about " 24 hour dining. </s>
<s> " 
That fact was never communicated to us when we checked in. </s>
<s> feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping. </s>
<s> later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off ; so maybe that 's why people were n't too intersted in providing good service. </s>
<s> do n't think if I would recommend that anyone stay at this Fairmont nor will I ever again. </s>
<s> ; the spa is great to hang out in ; even if you 're not doing a massage. </s>
<s> : I stayed in the 16thz floor. </s>
<s> double bed room. </s>
<s> room has a decent size. </s>
<s> is state of the art. </s>
<s> Furniture are stylish. </s>
<s> Size was very nice. </s>
<s> could have left my big suitcase opened throughout the stay ' which rarely happens in most hotels ; 42 " LCD Screen Complimentary WiFi in the room The bed and pillows are of extrodinary quality which provided an excellent deep sleep to me. </s>
<s> Located quite central. </s>
<s> streets are in reach of 5 minutes by feet. </s>
<s> Airport is in reach by cab within 30 minutes ' 30 USD. </s>
<s> - Spa and Fitness exists - though I did not use. </s>
<s> Restuarant ' not used - Business Center - Very friendly and helpful staff. </s>
<s> even printed our boarding passes at the reception I do travel frquently ; and do recommend this hotel for a business stay ; as also for an overnight with friends going shopping ; partying whatever in the city center of Chicago. </s>
<s> was very moderate for teh standard being provided at a downtown hotel. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago ; Il. </s>
<s> the start ; the experience was bad. </s>
<s> room was filthy ; there were no towels ; and the front desk did nothing to rectify the situation. </s>
<s> will never stay there again. </s>
<s> could not have been more dissatisfied. </s>
<s> Hotel in Chicago was an extremely pleasant and exciting hotel experience. </s>
<s> was taken away by the design and decor of the building and the exceptional customer service. </s>
<s> will definitely be returning for another stay ! What a wonderful experience ; super great ; helpful ; friendly staff. </s>
<s> at the front desk made sure my husbands birthday would be great. </s>
<s> room was beautiful. </s>
<s> suggested we go to Sullivans for dinner . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> perfect choice ; make the reservation for us. </s>
<s> 'best seat in the house and a special dessert wow . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> Above and beyond what any other hotel or staff has done for us before . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> Looking forward to staying there again again. </s>
<s> AGAIN My wife and I came to spend the weekend in downtown Chicago for shopping and we found this Conrad hotel well located close to everything downtown and of a size that does n't make you feel lost in the Convention world. </s>
<s> have had this feeling when staying at larger hotels in the past. </s>
<s> Suite has view on Michigan avenue with a bit of the Lake at the end. </s>
<s> was very professional ; pleasant and friendly making us feel very comfortable. </s>
<s> is free n the rooms and I am making my review from there. </s>
<s> Chicago - My stay at hotel Hilton was very satisfying. </s>
<s> room I stayed was very comfortable. </s>
<s> room had all the top-notch basic amenities. </s>
<s> stayed at the 7th floor and the view of the city was spectacular which added to the beauty of the hotel stay. </s>
<s> on the comfortable beds I had a fantastic time lazing over a recent movie on the HD television set in the room. </s>
<s> bathrooms were very clean and tidy which showed how cleanliness was a top priority at the hotel. </s>
<s> the location of the hotel is very strategic as most of the tourist attractions around the city are within comfortable distance along with easy access to local public transportation. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel to everyone and would definitely come back. </s>
<s> we got checked and arrived at our room the first thing we noticed was the light did n't come on when we flipped the switch upon entering. </s>
<s> room was not very clean at all. </s>
<s> had collected on the back of the tv and on the stand behind it ; on the window sill and stains on the carpet. </s>
<s> had requested wireless internet service but it was down the entire first night. </s>
<s> mattress was very hard making for an uncomfortable night. </s>
<s> jacuzzi was out of order also. </s>
<s> asked to be moved to a different room we were informed that there were not others available. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 's our story : My wife and I are Californians but met as students at the University of Chicago. </s>
<s> celebrate our 10th anniversary ; we decided to travel back to the Windy City and revisit all of the places we frequented when we were first falling in love. </s>
<s> it came to lodging ; we knew we wanted a suite but little else mattered. </s>
<s> wanted to revisit the city and did n't intend to spend very much time in our room. </s>
<s> a result ; we did n't spend very much time researching hotels. </s>
<s> mistake. </s>
<s> stay at Homewood Suites could not have been worse. </s>
<s> room ; which ; I should mention ; took a full two hours for them to prepare even though we had booked it months in advance ; was filthy. </s>
<s> My wife found a dead cockroach in the bathroom. </s>
<s> '
The staff was rude and indifferent. </s>
<s> chocolates included in the Romance Package could not have cost the hotel more than a dollar. </s>
<s> staff failed to show up. </s>
<s> desk offered apologies but little else. </s>
<s> it to say ; we checked out early. </s>
<s> before have I seen such a poorly-managed hotel. </s>
<s> shameful. </s>
<s> away ! This hotel was not at all what I expected it would be. </s>
<s> website and it 's pictures portray the hotel in a much better condition than it is actually in. </s>
<s> amenities were not what I was looking for ; and the price of the hotel was not a good value for what was offered there. </s>
<s> AAA membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels. </s>
<s> staff was not very friendly or helpful when I had questions about the area ; and they were not very prompt when responding to requests. </s>
<s> understand that there were a lot of guests staying there while I was there ; but they need to have more staff on hand if they can not provide their hotel guests with quality service. </s>
<s> do n't think I will be staying at this hotel again anytime soon. </s>
<s> what I needed at James : I ca n't tell you how impressed I was with my stay at the James Chicago Hotel. </s>
<s> came into town for a week long business conference and was referred to the James by a friend. </s>
<s> crisp ; clean ; contemporary ambiance made me feel like I was on a relaxed vacation rather than work. </s>
<s> was luxury without being over the top. </s>
<s> room was clean ; comfortable and was above all standards comfortable. </s>
<s> my down time I enjoyed a relaxing massage at the spa and happy hour at the " JBar " ; and I highly recommend dinner at the " David Burke Primehouse " The customer service from all the staff members ; from front desk ; to house keeping to the bartender was excellent. </s>
<s> plan on returning on my spring vist and look forward to another phenomenal experience. </s>
<s> Hotel Monaco is a hotel that some say has " character " . </s>
<s> found the decor tacky and had a hard time relaxing in the room designed with clashing colors and " contemporary furniture " . </s>
<s> found the fact that you have to be a member of the Kimpton rewards club to get free wi-fi access to be annoying at the least. </s>
<s> of their pet-friendly policy ; our room smelled like a wet dog ; and a canine " guest " down the hall kept us up all night with his howling. </s>
<s> the dog would have howled less if the 24-hour room service were faster. </s>
<s> waited an hour and a half for our order : meaning we did not get our dinner we wanted at 10 : 00 pm until midnight ! All in all ; we would not stay here again. </s>
<s> views and location are great ; but for the money there are better places to stay in Chicago. </s>
<s> booked a room at the Hilton Chicago for two nights to stay the weekend ; but upon arrival our reservation could not be found. </s>
<s> even provided the hotel with our confirmation number ; but it still was n't available ! Fortunately ; another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us. </s>
<s> we settled into our room for the night ' after a long flight ; there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom. </s>
<s> the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to re-clean it after our arrival. </s>
<s> to say ; with both of these poor experiences in just one night ; I will be hesitant to EVER stay in this hotel again ; let alone any other Hilton around. </s>
<s> consider someplace else before the Hilton Chicago ! Very luxurious and worth the money. </s>
<s> you are looking to relax and unwind in a great hotel then this is the one to choose. </s>
<s> staff was great and friendly. </s>
<s> forget the 24 hour room service which is a great treat. </s>
<s> stay at the James Hotel in Chicago was fantastic ! The hotel was clean ; modern and everything I had hoped for. </s>
<s> staff was fabulous and went above and beyond all of our expectations. </s>
<s> of our needs were more than met and I will be recommending this hotel to all of our friends and associates. </s>
<s> wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience. </s>
<s> hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location. </s>
<s> 's in a quiet location ; yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to. </s>
<s> upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost. </s>
<s> didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have ; but it was elegantly appointed ; spacious ; and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet. </s>
<s> service was amazing. </s>
<s> was extremely friendly and helpful ; as well as knowledgeable. </s>
<s> was true from the doormen at the front ; to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant. </s>
<s> Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions ; and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out. </s>
<s> breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel ; this goes for the room service as well. </s>
<s> there was good ; but not great. </s>
<s> mentioned almost flawless ; as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel. </s>
<s> involved scheduling and was aggravating ; as the hotel actively encourages its use. </s>
<s> ; Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied ; following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with. </s>
<s> experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly. </s>
<s> ; we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits. </s>
<s> Chicago Hotel Towers - My stay at this hotel was awful. </s>
<s> was my first visit to Chicago and I was really excited about it ; but staying at Sheraton ruined it. </s>
<s> boyfriend and I had to wait for 4 hours to check into our room ; and it was surprisingly small and dirty. </s>
<s> would not expect a room so small and dirty at such a high price ! We then requested to change a room and it took the staff another 3 hours to get it done. </s>
<s> were satisfied with the condition of our second room and then decided to go to the pool ; and we were so disappointed. </s>
<s> were no one at the pool ; and the staff knew so little about their hotel that we asked three people to finally get there ! The only thing that one can not pick is the location of this hotel. </s>
<s> is right at downtown Chicago and very easy to go to everywhere. </s>
<s> than that ; I did not find anything in this hotel that worth the price it charged. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel to any friend and I would certainly not stay there again. </s>
<s> were disappointed with this hotel. </s>
<s> staff seems hurried and unhelpful. </s>
<s> room was not made up until after 5 PM despite several requests. </s>
<s> blower in the hallway blew freezing air ; but the staff told us that there was nothing that could be done about it. </s>
<s> lobby is not inviting and there is no where comfortable to sit. </s>
<s> room and bed was comfortable ; but the cream and and modern art work are not our style. </s>
<s> room lacked many of the amenities other hotels in this price range offer. </s>
<s> not worth the rate compared to other hotels I have stayed at in Chicago. </s>
<s> wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago and had an okay experience. </s>
<s> location contrary to other reviews is not very good for a downtown Chicago hotel. </s>
<s> is at least a fifteen minute walk which in the winter in Chicago means a taxi ride. </s>
<s> other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere. </s>
<s> do n't necessarily mind people smoking but the lobby ; the elevator lobbies and any area that was public had tons of people smoking and ashtrays everywhere. </s>
<s> pool 'spa 'excercise room was not very impressive either. </s>
<s> is accessible by walking through the business center corridor ; wondering if you 're going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small. </s>
<s> is also no hot tub and the " spa " is a closet with a massage table. </s>
<s> concierge was helpful but the people that answer the " sheraton promise " phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors. </s>
<s> beds were super comfortable. </s>
<s> think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for couples or families you can do MUCH better in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> Chicago ; Millennium Park - My wife and I just got back from Chicago ; where we stayed at the Fairmont. </s>
<s> trip was awesome and the great food ; elegantly styled room and amazing service at the hotel were definitely a large reason our trip was so good. </s>
<s> highly recommend this hotel ! I booked this hotel with great expectations. </s>
<s> had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago. </s>
<s> arriving to the hotel ' at the exact time I indicated in my reservation I was told I 've been " downgraded " to a lesser quality room. </s>
<s> travel very often and never had this before. </s>
<s> ; I did not hear a single " I 'm sorry " ; it was like usual business. </s>
<s> bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me " I will decrease the rate for you " " what do you think ; nice eh ? " like he was doing me a favor ! They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course ' which is the legal thing to do ; since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money. </s>
<s> did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value. </s>
<s> did not know what to say ; since this never happened to me before ; also with family present did not want to start arguing. </s>
<s> rooms were nice ' not as nice as I thought and location is good ; however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this. </s>
<s> is enough for me not to go back again. </s>
<s> Allegro in downtown Chicago is a great stay part of the Kimpton Group boutique hotels the Allegro offers a classy stay in a beautiful room for a moterate price they offer complimentary and decent wine gratis in the late afternoon and the hotel allows you access to everything the loop has to offer in this remarkable city. </s>
<s> would recommend parking outside of the downtown area and taking the ' EL into the loop which leaves you about 2 minutes from the hotel otherwise you are looking at hefty parking fees for a car you dont need in this part of the city . </s>
<s> the rooms are small but beautifully done with great colors ; comfortable beds and in my case great views. </s>
<s> you go to kimpton group website and sign up for specials you will be alerted to great rates on certain days kimpton does a great job and their properties are " class acts " We usually stay at the Sofitel but thought we would try the Conrad for a change. </s>
<s> do n't think I would rate this hotel over the Sofitel but it was still 1st class. </s>
<s> I do think the service was better at the Conrad. </s>
<s> arrived at the hotel just before the restaurant closed and soon we were the only table left. </s>
<s> service goes down hill then but our waiter Eric was the best. </s>
<s> when I kept ordering my after dinner ports. </s>
<s> meal may not have been The Chop House but it was still very good. </s>
<s> bar was ok ; no Crown Reserve. </s>
<s> did have the Cask 16 at $ 24 a drink ; ouch. </s>
<s> room service was very quick. </s>
<s> room was very clean and the maids replace everything including the ashtrays during their visits. </s>
<s> only fault we could find was the temperature on the 14th floor. </s>
<s> was so hot that we had our window open the whole time with the heat turned completely off. </s>
<s> was n't so bad since my wife smokes. </s>
<s> temp on the 5th where the lobby ; bar ; and restaurant was fine. </s>
<s> enjoyed the hotel enough that we will be back in Sept. </s>
<s> last thing ; if you like a cheap fantastic breakfast. </s>
<s> to the West Egg ; only a few blocks away. </s>
<s> location is ideal. </s>
<s> have very high ceilings so the rooms appear much larger than they are. </s>
<s> views are great. </s>
<s> were fresh flowers in the bathroom. </s>
<s> had all white bedding. </s>
<s> feel like a princess there. </s>
<s> James Chicago - Though the hotel was at a great location ; the rooms were very small and I could hear normal talks in the adjacent rooms. </s>
<s> had to figure out myself how to connect to the wireless internet connection and only to know that the speed was very slow and the range itself was not good. </s>
<s> breakfast was not worth the money. </s>
<s> would never go there again. </s>
<s> booked directly with the Intercontinental -- a special room for our wedding night. </s>
<s> our wedding ; we went to the Hotel excited and happy. </s>
<s> we got there ; the night changed. </s>
<s> were treated rudely and with no respect. </s>
<s> told us there was " no room " even though we had a confirmation number. </s>
<s> of showing any empathy ; they told us to go sit down while they figured out " what to do with us " . </s>
<s> husband was in his tux and I was in my wedding gown ! No apology ! No concern ! We were given $ 20 and told to go find a cab and take it to a hotel where they 'd " found " a room. </s>
<s> Intercontinental RUINED our wedding night. </s>
<s> are telling anyone and everyone of our experience. </s>
<s> place was supposed to be elegant. </s>
<s> 've never been treated so poorly. </s>
<s> will never stay in another Intercontinental Hotel and highly recommend you do not contribute to a place that would do this to a newly married couple ! STEER clear of this place. </s>
<s> stayed Affinia for one night on a purpose not to drive all the way from NW suburbs to Women 's hospital oir my surgery. </s>
<s> things I really did n't enjoy - I could hear noise from outside all night long as well as inside noise from slamming doors. </s>
<s> noise insulation at all ! Very dusty between window frames 'I understand - cars ; pollution but it looked like it was n't cleaned for a very long time. </s>
<s> more thing really made me upset - broken blinds on a right side. </s>
<s> was unable to pull them down to enjoy my sleep time . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> We did n't notice the problem until very-very late. </s>
<s> Affinia hotel serving tourists and guests of Chicago as well as Northwestern Hospital patients and their families - which really need extra privacy and comfort ! Strange but every hotel I stayed was supplied with the SEALED roll of toilet paper. </s>
<s> did n't even offer that. </s>
<s> like someone used a bathroom right after it was taking care of by a cleaning lady ! Neither toilet paper nor toilet seat were sealed for us to use ! Hopefully ; no more surgeries for me . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> Wo n't stay this place for leisure - even with discount ! The Sheraton Chicago is not the place to be if you want to experience Chicago. </s>
<s> are no customer services to provide you with ideas of what to do ; and there are n't even any shuttles that will bring you around town. </s>
<s> food in the restaurant at the Hotel serves mediocre burgers and fries ; and makes no attempt to emulate the Chicago culture. </s>
<s> are a million other hotels in Chicago ; and this is one of the most average. </s>
<s> rooms are fairly decent sized ; but they lack amenities like wi-fi and mini bars. </s>
<s> view is nothing special ; and the concierge is anything but responsive to phone calls. </s>
<s> got an awesome deal through Priceline for a Friday - Sunday stay at $ 75 for each night. </s>
<s> hotel is very centrally located on Michigan Avenue " The Magnificent Mile " . </s>
<s> can walk to a ton of shops there are plenty of restaurants handy as well. </s>
<s> hotel staff was very friendly ; and the room itself was gorgeous. </s>
<s> modern decor. </s>
<s> drab typical like most other chain hotels. </s>
<s> staying in Chicago we definitely will be staying there again. </s>
<s> for valet parking overnight was insane $ 42 'day ; but what do you expect in a big city. </s>
<s> stay at the Millenium was amazing ! Me and my husband came to Chicago for our anniversary ; and there was a mess-up with our reservation ; so we got upgraded to a superior room for free. </s>
<s> location was excellent ; since it allowed us to visit all the nearby museums and shopping centers without having to rent a taxi. </s>
<s> bartender at the bar downstairs was very friendly ; and introduced us to drinks we 've never heard of before. </s>
<s> you ! Our room directly overlooked Lake Michigan ; and it was very spacious ; with an easy-access minibar and a very nice bathroom. </s>
<s> only complaint is that the wireless is a little pricey ; but other than that ; it was an amazing stay ! Will come back to again ! I have just returned from a lovely shopping trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> is a very nice hotel ; and I will love to stay there if I visit Chicago again ! There is a lot of positive to say about the hotel ; staff is excellent ; never experienced such an excellent service -- that alone is worth coming back for. </s>
<s> pleasantly surprised that the room rate was including breakfast. </s>
<s> few things that could make this hotel even better . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
A hand shower in the bathroom. </s>
<s> hairdryer to be placed in the bedroom ; instead of the bathroom ; when the bathroom is all damp after a shower I prefer leaving the bathroom to dry my hair. </s>
<s> internet access in the lobby. </s>
<s> was surprised I had to pay 6 or 7 USD ' for 15 minutes to log-on and check-in with my airline ' only with a few airlines you can check-in without paying ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ' Amalfi Hotel Chicago-I recently stayed there for 2 nights during my short visit to the University of Chicago. </s>
<s> 's a little expensive since I booked it quite late but it 's TOTALLY worth it ! It is located in a great and safe neighborhood in downtown Chicago ; within walking distance to the University of Chicago. </s>

Travel to Chicago stay at the Palmer House or Fairmont. </s>
<s> had to write this review ! My tired body walked through the doors of The Fairmont. </s>
<s> felt like I walked through heaven 's gates ; the lobby was majestic and the staff was so friendly ; that I was instantly energized. </s>
<s> front desk staff was very helpful and quick to find my reservation and get my bags up to my room. </s>
<s> were so nice to inform me of the health club and spa . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> oh those wonderful spa treatments that are offered are incredible ; I took advantage of a soothing pedicure during my visit ' my very first as well as a massage. </s>
<s> was amazed at the size of the meeting 'conference room that we used for an afternoon. </s>
<s> room was so clean and the bed was better than the one at home. </s>
<s> food downstairs in the restaurant smelled so good that as tired as I was after the meeting ; instead of room service ; I went in ; and the food was mouth watering delicious ; and the wait staff was very hospitable They take great pride in everything ; even the wake up call was friendly. </s>
<s> stay was so great ; that I want to go back again soon ! The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a magnificent grand hotel. </s>
<s> size of the rooms ; and the views of the city are phenomenal. </s>
<s> night the city lights up ; and the sight is majestic. </s>
<s> hotel itself ; and the employee 's are wonderful ; and well worth the pay to stay in such a place. </s>
<s> Hotel has so much to offer ; great dining ; a fantastic gym set up for those of us ; who really like to stay fit no matter what we are doing. </s>
<s> wife and I have just left recently ; and we are already planning to stay there on our next trip out. </s>
<s> thumbs up to Those who run that place ; and helped us enjoy our stay. </s>
<s> stayed at the Allegro for several days in August 2004 and I would defintely stay again. </s>
<s> had a very large room with a huge bathroom ; although the property is a converted theater so the rooms may vary in size and layout. </s>
<s> lobby is comfortable with big sofas and chaise lounges ; a nice place to enjoy the simple ' 2 choices ; no munchies but pleasant wine reception. </s>
<s> night ; there is not much going on in the immediate vicinity ; other than theater traffic ; but it 's a short cab ride to Michigan Avenue shopping and River North restaurants. </s>
<s> Homewood Suites is one of my favorite hotels in Chicago ! It is a great place to stay as a family. </s>
<s> last time my family and I visited Chicago ; we stayed and picked the Shedd Aquarium package. </s>
<s> an amazing time ! The Aquarium is great ; and we saved a lot of money by buying this package. </s>
<s> also appreciated that fact that our room had a kitchen. </s>
<s> two really picky children ; it was so nice to be able to cook ; or at least to have the option. </s>
<s> also enjoyed the many neat facilities in the Homewood Suites Chicago Downtown. </s>
<s> pool ; great workout room ; breakfast buffet and the wine and beer dinner in the evening. </s>
<s> would n't stay anywhere else when I visit the Windy City ! As a former Chicagoan ; I 'm appalled at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago. </s>
<s> of all ; I was expecting luxury and hospitality ; neither of which I received. </s>
<s> 's an Experience Designer who is supposed to be like a " personal concierge ; " but my experience with my ED was terrible. </s>
<s> felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than I wanted to. </s>
<s> only that ; but I could n't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast. </s>
<s> I finally got to my room ; I was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room 's cleanliness. </s>
<s> had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. </s>
<s> top of that ; the bed was messily done ; I could have done a better job on my own bed at home. </s>
<s> was angry at this point ; because I was paying a lot of money for every night I was staying at Amalfi ; and I did n't expect to be greeted with wet towels. </s>
<s> needed to use the Wi-Fi to download some important documents ; and the internet was surprisingly slow. </s>
<s> a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better ; maybe even faster internet access. </s>
<s> I finally checked out of the Amalfi ; I made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems I 'd had with my room and the hotel. </s>
<s> was glad to see the Amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as I drove away ! I had high hopes for the Hilton Chicago ; but I am sad to say that I am disapointed. </s>
<s> only is it outrageously expensive ' over $ 200 for two people for one night ; but they expect you to pay over $ 40 to park your car ! They do not offer free Wi-Fi ; but instead I had to pay $ 20 to get on the internet in my room. </s>
<s> had to wait until 3 pm to check in ' even though my flight was in the morning and I had to rent a car at the airport because the hotel did not offer transportation too and from. </s>
<s> all of this stress ; the Hilton Chicago did n't have an in hotel bar either. </s>
<s> doubt I will stay here again ! I have to thank the Ambassador East Hotel for providing a really great experience for my family. </s>
<s> never leave our dog at home when we travel ; and it 's been a long time since we 've been able to find a place of this caliber that allows pets. </s>
<s> staff even spent time cooing over how cute our dog is when we asked about local clothing boutiques. </s>
<s> husband liked the fitness room. </s>
<s> was nice and clean ; with plenty of extra towels available. </s>
<s> was colder than we expected with the wind blowing in off the water ; but the concierge knew exactly where we should go for jackets and scarves. </s>
<s> will definitely be staying here next time we visit Chicago. </s>
<s> would make the trip just to stay here. </s>
<s> 's how welcome we felt when we stayed at this hotel. </s>
<s> Bill at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago My wife and I decided to take a weekend getaway to celebrate our anniversary. </s>
<s> told my wife that I would take care of everything. </s>
<s> booked the Millennium Knickerbocker because it had a great location ; it was reasonably priced for a 4 star hotel and had spa features. </s>
<s> hotel loby seemed nice enough and the staff seemed fine. </s>
<s> problems for us started when we went to our room. </s>
<s> have sinus problems ; so I did n't notice the smell in our room ; and my wife did n't say anything to me because she wanted to go with the flow and not ruin our weekend. </s>
<s> could n't find the remote for our television and we did n't call down ; we were trying to be good sports. </s>
<s> were both disappointed when we realized that our hotel did n't have a pool or hot tub ; swimming and relaxing in a hot tub is one of the reasons we go on vacation. </s>
<s> checking out I was hit was 250 dollar fee for smoking in our room. </s>
<s> wife and I do n't smoke and there was nothing we could do to get out of the smoking fee. </s>
<s> that was n't bad enough we were hit with a 50 fee for the missing remote control. </s>
<s> have been 4 times in Chicago ; and I have stayed in 4 different Hotels : This has been for much the very best option. </s>
<s> lobby ; the warm of the receptionist ; the room ; the hotel is very good. </s>
<s> is walking distance to the Magnificent Mile and there 's no chance for you to get lost from this hotel. </s>
<s> you like to travel with style this could be a very good option. </s>
<s> room was big and luxurious ; befitting the price tag $ 299. </s>
<s> was very comfortable. </s>
<s> ; my bed was against the wall abutting the elevator shaft ; and I heard the elevators running all night. </s>
<s> held a one-day conference there for 25 people. </s>
<s> stuck us in a long ; narrow room that was cramped. </s>
<s> ; the night before we had a pre-conference dinner at the Palm restaurant in the hotel. </s>
<s> was so slow that some of our party left before entrees were served. </s>
<s> the steaks were only so-so ; a far cry from my experience with other Palms. </s>
<s> very nice hotel with small but adequate rooms. </s>
<s> decor was lovely. </s>
<s> daughter and I spent 5-nights here ; saw Wicked just down the street and used the public transportation to get all around town. </s>
<s> a bit disappointed with the bar 'restaurant which opened and closed it 's kitchen at will without regard to posted hours. </s>
<s> room description boasted of safe 's large enough to accomodate a laptop ; so I brought mine. </s>
<s> was informed after check-in that the safes are not in every room ' and not in mine. </s>
<s> a side note ; I was surprised that nearly all the shops many restaurants closed at 6pm in that area . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  even the 7-11. </s>
<s> stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Hotel was a short one ; although ; it was intended to be for five days ; it only last two. </s>
<s> me and my husband arrived we were met by a valet who knicked our Mercedez. </s>
<s> clerk 'concierge was on his phone for nearly 5 FULL minutes before he noticed that we were standing in front of him. </s>
<s> we checked in ; we lugged all of our luggage upstairs to our room to find that someone was already in it. </s>
<s> then returned to Lobby ; and to our dismay ; the hotel had Double Booked the room ! After another 30 minutes of haggling and whatnot we were able to be moved to a " better " room. </s>
<s> bed was unbearable ; the shower looked like it hadnt been cleaned properly and the room smelled of cigarrettes ' although it was supposedly a non-smoking room. </s>
<s> tired and jet lagged to complain we went to sleep. </s>
<s> ; it was hard for us to do so because voices could be heard all thoughout the night due to the paper thin walls of the room. </s>
<s> needed an Ambien to go to sleep. </s>
<s> woke up with backaches ; the continental breakfast had me in the bathroom most of the day ; and the maids conveniently forgot to clean our room. </s>
<s> and my husband had had enough and decided to go to the Hyatt. </s>
<s> was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in Chicago turned into a complete disaster. </s>
<s> first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> they knew we had 6 ! We ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel. </s>
<s> we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other. </s>
<s> some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor ; unfortunately one of the rooms had n't even been cleaned which meant more waiting around. </s>
<s> staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating. </s>
<s> our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5 : 30am. </s>
<s> my calls to the front desk ; the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes. </s>
<s> also did n't know the hotel was sooo pet friendly. </s>
<s> morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door. </s>
<s> understand they allow pets ; but really . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> people need to clean up after their animals . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> or have some dog free floors. </s>
<s> Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms ; their service was terrible ; the staff was rude ; and I still ca n't get over that dog poo in the hallway. </s>
<s> definitely wo n't be staying here again. </s>
<s> Hotel Chicago I stayed here with friends and my experience was not quite good. </s>
<s> room given to us was big enough but servicing was bad. </s>
<s> dint get the ordered food on time and had to call them again to remind them. </s>
<s> were stubborn at times and we were quite unhappy with their behavior. </s>
<s> was not worth staying here. </s>
<s> do n't recommend this hotel unless you want to spend lot of money and get a bad service. </s>
<s> attended a Bachorette Party in Chicago in Aug 2005. </s>
<s> were 10 girls total. </s>
<s> had 5 rooms . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  and I did not hear one complaint from anyone during our entire extended weekend. </s>
<s> been to Chi-town before ; I booked our hotel based on reviews from TA. </s>
<s> we were not disappointed. </s>
<s> staff is wonderful ; the happy hour was just fabulous. </s>
<s> room was nice and clean ; with a great double headed shower and Aveda products was an extra bonus ! Then you also get free internet in your room ! The hotel was chic and hip without the pretentiousness. </s>
<s> still talk about what a wonderful time we had . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  and we all agree that if we ever go back to Chicago we will be staying at the Amalfi again. </s>
<s> me the pics do n't do it justice ! The room was dingy and run down - it felt like staying in a cheap motel. </s>
<s> carpet was exceptionally worn ; wallpaper peeling ; bathroom grout dingy. </s>
<s> place felt like it had n't been redecorated in 30 years. </s>
<s> top of that ; the windows would not open ' not unusual for a hig-rise hotel ; and there was no air fan for ac or heat - how the temp control was supposed to work ; I have no idea ' they said ' radient cooling whatever that is ; but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation. </s>
<s> even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated. </s>
<s> much for privacy. </s>
<s> ca n't comment on the food ; because we ate out at every chance. </s>
<s> has some fantastic food ! And much of it within easy distance to the hotel. </s>
<s> hotel is in a good location ; near the waterfront and millenium park ; shopping and dining. </s>
<s> conference facilities were average ; but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was non-existent. </s>
<s> will never stay in this hotel again ; especially for the price ; because of the poor room quality. </s>
<s> our anniversary this year ; my wife and I stayed at the Conrad. </s>
<s> 're from the suburbs ; so staying at a nice hotel in the city is a big deal for us. </s>
<s> 's expensive ; so we expect the best for our money. </s>
<s> was most definitely not the best for our money. </s>
<s> was n't even a good deal either. </s>
<s> problems began right off the bat. </s>
<s> we got to our room ; we were both greeted by a musty smell that seemed to hang throughout the entirety of the room. </s>
<s> was like walking into a dusty attic. </s>
<s> I sat down to watch TV ; it turns out it was n't even connected to cable or anything. </s>
<s> kept changing the channel ; but it was nothing but static and white noise. </s>
<s> even looked for another remote. </s>
<s> we left our things ; we went out for a night in Chicago ; but coming back ; the smell seemed to have gotten worse. </s>
<s> finally asked the hotel management to come up to our rooms. </s>
<s> moved us to a different room ; but they had no explanation for the smell. </s>
<s> a single stay ; that was more trouble than it was worth. </s>
<s> family 's seven day stay at the InterContinental Chicago hotel was more than I could ever imagine. </s>
<s> InterContinental is more fantastic than any previous hotel I have visited ; because of its wonderful amenities ; such as the excellent 24 hour room service ; access to personal trainers ; and even a dry cleaning service ; just to mention a few. </s>
<s> family really enjoyed dining on the contemporary American cuisine at the hotels Zest Restaurant ; which served an excellent meal worth every dime of its reasonable price. </s>
<s> most favorite point about the InterContinental Chicago is that it provides entry right into the Windy City ; where my family and I had immediate access to transportation ; shopping ; and city attractions. </s>
<s> had a great time traveling through Chicago and enjoying ourselves while at the same time we felt secure knowing that we had a nice ; clean ; elegant ; safe hotel to travel back to whenever we were done touring the city each day. </s>
<s> InterContinental is a must stay and I will recommend them to anyone who plans on visiting Chicago. </s>
<s> recently stayed at The Talbott Hotel for 3 nights and I could not have been more disappointed. </s>
<s> was a terrible experience. </s>
<s> wait to check into room since room was n't ready even though I arrived way after the check in time. </s>
<s> desk was very rude. </s>
<s> given a smoking room when I had requested non-smoking. </s>
<s> service left a lot to be desired. </s>
<s> food took forever to arrive and when it did it was cold and unappetizing. </s>
<s> staff at the hotel was not very helpful and was very unfriendly. </s>
<s> no toilet paper in room. </s>
<s> was very noisy. </s>
<s> hear people next door opening doors ; watching tv ; talking. </s>
<s> room was very dingy ; small and had a musty odor. </s>
<s> to say I will not be staying here again nor will I be recommending this hotel to anyone else. </s>
<s> away from this hotel. </s>
<s> worth the money. </s>
<s> lovely hotel has only six floors ; making it easy to get to elevators and down to reception. </s>
<s> building is dwarfed amongst all the skyscrapers around it. </s>
<s> 's huge new tower is just down the street. </s>
<s> Amalfi looks recently refurbished ; very modern ; but warm and inviting. </s>
<s> quite spacious with lovely linens and very ; very comfortable beds. </s>
<s> quite small but roomy enough ; with Aveda tolietries and constant hot water in the showers. </s>
<s> style breakfast is set out fresh every morning in front of the elevator of every floor. </s>
<s> to stumble out of bed and grab a coffee etc ' robes slippers provided without having to get dressed for a formal breakfast. </s>
<s> enjoyed the Managers evening cocktail reception ; especially the Amalfitinis. </s>
<s> nice way to relax after a hard days shopping ! Location is great for all the shops ; transport ; museums etc. </s>
<s> walking to everywhere. </s>
<s> also very friendly and welcoming. </s>
<s> definately stay there again. </s>
<s> away from home ! The suites are amazing with great views of the city. </s>
<s> food is delious and served by an excellent staff. </s>
<s> loved the heated pool on the top floor ; very relaxing after a long day of meetings. </s>
<s> place to stay when your in Chicago ! My first trip back to Chicago in about 7 years was perfect ! I chose the Knickerbocker as I had read that their rooms were recently renovated on top of being a great location to Michigan Avenue ; Rush Street and downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> must say I was very impressed with the guestrooms ! I had not stayed there prior but it definitely is a refresh from what I 've seen in photo 's posted on the reviews. </s>
<s> guestrooms are nicely decorated with a modern feel and they are good sized for a historical hotel ! The beds are wonderful -- I need to get a pillow top mattress at home ! I used the Internet access with no issue and I LOVED the larger screen TV 's. </s>
<s> shower is fun with the different types of shower heads you can choose. </s>
<s> the bathrooms are fresh with all new granite and tile. </s>
<s> 'm anxious to get back to Chicago and it wo n't be 7 years from now ! I would highly recommend this hotel -- fantastic guestrooms ; location and staff ! I 've added some digital pictures of my room as they are completely different from the one 's I saw on previous reviews with the new renovation. </s>
<s> my recent trip to Chicago ; I stayed at the Ambassador East hotel ; which is located in the downtown are. </s>
<s> have to say I was not pleased with my stay there. </s>
<s> one ; I had requested that my room have one king sized bed when I called for reservations ; however ; when I arrived ; the hotel lobby clerk said they did not have any king sized beds left and I had to settle with two double sized beds. </s>
<s> I told the clerk that a king sized was promised when i made the reservation ; he just shrugged his shoulders. </s>
<s> I got to my room ; I found it to be very small. </s>
<s> was supposed to be a small refrigerator in the room. </s>
<s> was n't ; although I did not bother to complain after all it did when they gave me the wrong bed. </s>
<s> night ; there seemed to be some sort of convention being held at the hotel. </s>
<s> did not figure what the convention was for ; but their attendees liked to stay up until the early morning and made way too much noise. </s>
<s> called the front desk several times complaining about the noise. </s>
<s> time they assured me they would deal with the noise ; but the racket never dissipated and I finally gave up getting any sleep. </s>
<s> did go back to the lobby before my trip ended to complain of the poor service that they have given me ; the manager said that she felt sorry for the trouble I had been having at the hotel ; but did not offer any refund or consolation for the trouble. </s>
<s> I left the Ambassador East ; I vowed that if I ever returned to Chigaco ; I would never stay at this place again. </s>
<s> Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is my favorite place to stay in Chicago ! I travel to Chicago very often to visit my son ; who is training for the U. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> Navy. </s>
<s> make every stay feel like a luxorius vacation. </s>
<s> indoor pool and sauna are amazing ; and I never have to miss a workout because the gym is fully equipped. </s>
<s> you dine at the LB Bistro ; you must try the Eggs Benedict : The staff are friendly and the prices are very reasonable for a hotel of this stature. </s>
<s> just spent a week at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel and it was a very plesant stay. </s>
<s> I first walked into the room it was very clean. </s>
<s> bathroom was a decent size and the decorum was pleasant. </s>
<s> service was very good. </s>
<s> view was amazing and I would recomend staying there. </s>
<s> Omni Hotels ; Chicago - Omni is an excellent place to stay. </s>
<s> is located right off the Michigan Avenue which puts it in a central location and it is also located pretty close to the airport. </s>
<s> staff is very pleasant and the decor is amazing. </s>
<s> rooms have pleasing aesthetics and the in-room luxuries aare apt for a 5-star hotel. </s>
<s> bathrooms are big and clean which I particularly like about the rooms. </s>
<s> room-service is a little late at times but usually pretty satisfactory. </s>
<s> addition to this ; the food is amazing which makes it worth for the wait. </s>
<s> gym is absolutely state-of-the-art ; as is the spa and the swimming pool. </s>
<s> a place to be more than once. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel over any other in Chicago When I went to The James hotel in Chicago I truly expected a luxury experience exactly like what they were advertising. </s>
<s> chairs ; staff at the desk focusing on their job ; and a clean ; well decorated hotel room. </s>
<s> to my ; and my wallet 's dismay I found quite the opposite. </s>
<s> arrived to the hotel late after my flight was delayed ; and found the clerk reading a magazine. </s>
<s> must have been a fascinating article ; as it took him a full minute to look up and ask if I had a reservation ; or would be making one. </s>
<s> said I had one ; and gave him the voucher I 'd printed out. </s>
<s> checked it ; and said that all the single rooms had already been rented out ; he went on to say that I would have to pay extra for a two or three person room if I wished to stay the night. </s>
<s> grudgingly accepted the two person option as the jet lag was setting in and I desperately needed to get some sleep. </s>
<s> clerk offered to walk me to my room ; saying I looked tired and trying to navigate the hotel would be much easier after I got some sleep. </s>
<s> accepted ; and followed him to my new room. </s>
<s> carried the briefcase I had with me ; but it was not apparent why at the time as I had both hands free. </s>
<s> ushered me into my room ; setting the briefcase down inside ; and said if I needed anything that the phone next to the bed would give me a direct line to room service without having to dial anything. </s>
<s> thanked him and closed the door. </s>
<s> was then that I looked around and fully saw where I was staying. </s>
<s> was supposedly a two person suite was two twin beds 6 " apart ; covered in ruffled blankets and sheets. </s>
<s> cleaning staff had obviously not been in here recently. </s>
<s> quick look around the other areas and I found the bathroom was out of toilet paper and soap ; not even the complementary ones were left behind. </s>
<s> got ready for bed ; and looked around for the TV remote ; which it turned out ; had no batteries in it. </s>
<s> ; I just turned out the lights and rolled over ; sheets and blanket turned inside out to try and find a cleaner option. </s>
<s> the morning I walked down to the lobby and asked to check out. </s>
<s> 'd had enough of the hotel after one night. </s>
<s> clerk that morning was a cheerful blond who cheerfully asked me my room number and handed me a bill. </s>
<s> 240 for my room ; and an extra $ 80 with a note about a baggage service. </s>
<s> asked her about it ; and she said if anyone carried my bags to my room for me it was filed under the baggage service. </s>
<s> asked if it was considered reasonable to charge $ 80 for carrying a suitcase to a room two floors up ; and riding the elevator ; and she said it was unusual ; but not unheard of. </s>
<s> offered to change it to a " mere " $ 20 and handed me a slip with a phone number ; name ; and reason for the disagreement ; saying that the manager would handle any complaints between the clerk and I after I signed it. </s>
<s> did so ; and left ; my wallet $ 260 lighter ; and my head throbbing with a headache from lack of sleep. </s>
<s> here while on a business trip in Chicago. </s>
<s> off the staff were very friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> were knowledgeable about the things in the area when I needed to find something. </s>
<s> had a king bed room - it was very clean and cozy and the view was great. </s>
<s> is definitely a hotel I will stay at again if my work takes me back to Chicago. </s>
<s> beautiful hotel. </s>
<s> historic features of this hotel make it absolutely amazing. </s>
<s> hotel offers many great guest accommodations of which I enjoyed the spacious ; tidy rooms. </s>
<s> staff here are very friendly ; helpful ; and professional. </s>
<s> concierge went out of her way to make sure we knew about the area and not just what was in the hotel. </s>
<s> especially enjoyed the service at The Lockwood Restaurant here. </s>
<s> server was excellent and the food was delicious ! I must say this hotel exceeded my expectations. </s>
<s> in all ; my stay was awesome ! Overall the hotel is very nice. </s>
<s> rooms are spacious and well-appointed ; but they tend to be aging or dated. </s>
<s> bathroom was particularly below average ; with old wallpaper and a dingy tub with a crummy showerhead. </s>
<s> toilet paper roll holder was pulling out of the wall and its screws were exposed. </s>
<s> conceirge recommended an expensive and mediocre restaurant. </s>
<s> hate it when they do that- it makes me suspect they 're getting kickbacks from places that otherwise do n't get enough business on their own. </s>
<s> was very good. </s>
<s> 's a relatively large european-style spread. </s>
<s> Very convenient location ; within walking distance of the Field Museum and the lake. </s>
<s> was spacious and clean ; but smelled slightly of dog. </s>
<s> service was quick ; I recommend trying the omelets. </s>
<s> got back from 2 days up in Chicago shopping with girlfriends. </s>
<s> time I have stayed at the Omni. </s>
<s> did so because I saw a $ 129. </s>

<s> of free food on Travelzoo. </s>
<s> three of us ' 55 year olds all stayed in one suite with 2 double beds and a VERY comfortable pull out sofa. </s>
<s> had plenty of room. </s>
<s> in the restaurant was great ; service was outstanding from everone we came into contact with ; early morning delivery of free coffee ; juice and hot chocolate was fabulous and recommendations from the staff on where to eat ; time of movies ; shopping areas ; etc was really helpful. </s>
<s> I mention the outstanding location ? Simply the best ! We all decided that the Omni is our new favorite hotel. </s>
<s> absolutely loved staying at the Swissotel Chicago. </s>
<s> entire hotel has such an elegant and luxurious feel to it. </s>
<s> room was absolutely stunning ! First of all ; it was so spotless and clean. </s>

<s> did n't have any problems at all but if I did I 'm sure the customer service at the hotel would have had it fixed very quick I could tell their top priority was the guests happiness and satisfaction ! There were even two restaurants in the hotel and a lounge ! I ca n't wait to go back to this hotel. </s>
<s> felt like I was on a luxurious vacation ! On our visit to Chicago ; we chose the Hyatt due to its location in downtown ; within walking distance to most major attractions ; such as Sears Tower ; Magnificent Mile ; Grant 'Millenium Parks ; etc. </s>

<s> can live with the bed situation but I truly feel that having to accept a room infused with cigarette smoke is completely wrong ! There was n't an area in the room where I did not feel nauseous from the stale smell and I can not help but think that this smell followed me around all day after check out. </s>
<s> add insult to injury ; the hotel staff was not sympathetic to our situation -- something I think they should be specifically trained to do -- and did not offer any compensation ; partial refund or related " perk " to make up for our great inconvenience. </s>
<s> staff members actually acted as if I was the inconvenience in asking them if there was anything they could do ! Although we paid for the breakfast package ; we were eager to leave immediately in the morning and dined elsewhere at our additional expense. </s>
<s> the pun ; but we just could not sit there and dine in the morning with such a bad taste in our mouth from the hotel 's lack of customer service ! I am hoping the corporate office responds to our complaints but ; thus far ; we have received no satisfaction. </s>
<s> to say ; we will not be visiting this property again ! In fact ; we are no longer going to patronize this brand of hotels. </s>
<s> a hotel rated with four diamonds by AAA ; one would think the Hilton Chicago would be almost like staying at a palace with royalty. </s>

<s> should have known from the moment I walked in with my wife that this was going to become a bigger headache than what it was worth. </s>
<s> off ; as soon as we arrived to check in at the hotel with the clerk who could n't be any older than nineteen or twenty ; red flags started going up. </s>
<s> clerk was extremely rude and lazy ; acting like it was a chore even getting up from texting on his cell phone. </s>
<s> that was n't bad enough ; the clerk pretty much ignored me while blatantly staring at my wife 's breasts. </s>
<s> was n't even wearing anything that could be considered skimpy as it was cold out and she was wearing a turtle neck sweater under a large fur lined coat. </s>
<s> diverting his atention several times we finally got our room keys. </s>
<s> should n't have been any surprise when we learned that there were no one to help us with our luggage as the clerk said they were all out on break. </s>
<s> ; that was annoying ; but we managed easy enough. </s>
<s> finally got to the third floor where our suite had been reserved for over a month and we looked forward to resting after our long trip. </s>
<s> our surprise ; not to mention our disgust and horror ; their was already a couple in what was supposed to be our room on the bed making out. </s>
<s> took almost a half hour between the couple in the room ; the front desk ; and my wife and me to get it straightened out. </s>
<s> the night clerk did n't bother following policy as they had taken our reservation off the computer to give to their friends while leaving the printed card for the day clerk. </s>
<s> what could only be described as chaos ; we were finally given another room on the next floor up. </s>

<s> a clinking sound I bent down to look what one of the bags could have hit to see an empty beer bottle sticking out from under the bed. </s>
<s> was about to call back down to give the clerk a piece of my mind when I heard my wife cry out. </s>
<s> on the wall of the bathroom were several roaches crawling around and I noticed something else in the sink that almost made us leave then and there. </s>
<s> ; in the sink and in very plain sight ; was a used condom ! So far we were less than thrilled about being there and we stomred back downstairs and demanded our money back. </s>
<s> then the desk manager had returned from where ever she went off to and talked us into taking another room ; free of charge to make up for our troubles. </s>
<s> room itself was thankfully clean with no bugs and no trash or any other disgusting items laying around. </s>
<s> being a lot smaller and not having the promised view that our other room should have had ; we decided to make due. </s>
<s> while my wife went to get cleaned up after our long trip I pulled my laptop out to use the so called high speed internet access. </s>
<s> should n't have even bothered as I 've used dial up that went at least three times as fast as the speeds I was getting. </s>
<s> a quick call to the desk I was informed the person responsible for the internet was gone for the day and there was nothing that could be done for the moment. </s>
<s> instead of worrying about it ; we went to get something to eat from the the onsite dinning area. </s>
<s> again we were met with rude people who either stared at my wife 's chest or forgot half of our order. </s>
<s> arguing with them for what seemed like forever over not getting everything ; we found that our found was not only bland ; it was cold ! We did n't even bother trying anything else ; that was the final straw so we got our things and found another hotel. </s>
<s> do n't know who would hire a bunch or rude employees who was barely out of high school or who could n't clean a room ; but I know that that hotel did n't deserve four diamonds unless it was in the negative. </s>
<s> place should be shut down because there is no way they know how to run a decent hotel. </s>
<s> Chicago - Not worth the price. </s>
<s> room on the second floor was very noisy due to traffic. </s>

<s> ? ? are you running here ? You are a hotel in the country 's third largest city and your amenities are open at whim ? This was our first and last visit to a Kimpton hotel. </s>

<s> room was very outdated-reminded us of the movie The Shining. </s>
<s> NOISY ! Do n't expect a quiet stay. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> during the week. </s>

<s> car was misplaced during valet parking ; our reservations were messed up ; hotel staff showed up repeatedly throughout the week at our door with items ' room service ; a new coffee pot ; laundry that was n't ours. </s>
<s> would not stay at this property again. </s>

<s> Chicago Having read the reviews ; I had very high expectations for this hotel ; but it was mediocre at best. </s>
<s> location is very good indeed ' one block from Mag Mile ; but that 's it. </s>
<s> booked a room with " a view " and as it turned out ; the " view " was of the building next to the hotel ; no joke ! Besides that ; the TV was n't working ; so I called the manager and their solution was to " downgrade " me to another room. </s>
<s> it was better to move to a cheaper room ; because " the view " was clearly not worth paying for ; but still ; it was a very poor handling of the situation. </s>
<s> rooms were large and clean and the bathroom was OK ; but there was so much noise from the street that I actually had a hard time trying to sleep. </s>
<s> was largely overpriced ' I spent around $ 30 and so was parking. </s>
<s> was cold most of the time and the manager did n't even apologize for the room change. </s>
<s> for the price they charge I expected much more. </s>
<s> time I go to Chicago ; I will look for other hotels where I can get more from my money. </s>
<s> frequently have business meetings in Downtown Chicago and find that the Hotel Monaco Chicago ; gives me the peace of mind to make those meetings enjoyable. </s>
<s> it might be more expensive than your average hotel . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but there is nothing average in this hotel. </s>
<s> any expectations - service ; food ; quality ; atmosphere were heads above anywhere. </s>
<s> for making my trips to Chicago - the best of the best. </s>
<s> Chicago Very nice stay overall. </s>
<s> was upgraded on check-in and got a large room on 12th floor. </s>

<s> recommended a small van tour ; which was excellent. </s>
<s> early April is too early to visit Chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the architecture of Chicago was not operating yet. </s>
<s> stayed in the Conrad for 4 nights just before Thanksgiving. </s>

<s> have to admit ; I was a little leery about visiting Chicago due to my mild agoraphobia ; but after a family member reserved a room at the Hotel Allegro Chicago ; my fears were slightly assuaged. </s>

<s> rooms themselves are incredibly homey ; feeling less like a hotel room and more like the guest room at a millionaire 's mansion. </s>
<s> high comfort level coupled with prompt service when requesting items such as extra pillows and towels ; really helped alleviate my apprehensions about staying in Chicago ; and provided a secure place to stay at night ; or whenever I did not feel like participating with the group. </s>
<s> course ; the rooms are second only to the overall feel of the hotel. </s>
<s> found myself spending less of my downtime in my room and more of it wandering around the building. </s>
<s> it 's very cozy ; and has a certain old-world feeling to it ; once again lending to it feeling less like a hotel and more like a mansion at times. </s>
<s> was never overwhelmingly crowded ; and the people I did encounter were incredibly friendly ; yet not intrusive. </s>
<s> do n't usually enjoy staying in hotels ; but I love the Allegro Chicago ! I went to Chicago on business last year and I had the pleasure of staying at the luxurious Hyatt Regency Hotel. </s>
<s> opted for the Business Plan ; although they have many different room descriptions available to choose from ; such as the Allergy Friendly ; Monarch Suite ; State Suite ; all the way up to the Presidential Suite. </s>
<s> suite was a perfect blend of business and comfort ; equipped with Wi-Fi ; a generous 37 inch television ; spacious work area and two queen sized beds you sink into feeling tension ease from your body. </s>

<s> would highly recommend this wonderful haven to anyone planning an overnight Chicago stay. </s>
<s> fiance and I had taken a trip to Chicago and wanted to stay someplace close to Downtown ; so he chose the Amalfi Hotel ; located conveniently to everything we needed. </s>
<s> place was phenomenal ! He chose a romantic getaway package ; as we were only in town for a few days and it was the best choice ever. </s>
<s> hotel is super clean and very chic ; the beds are so comfortable and the staff is superb. </s>
<s> were able to bring along our dog ; which was also really important to us. </s>

<s> : Lift noise ; lifts slow and restaurant ' there are so many great restaurants around - do n't bother staying in Would stay again ! This hotel is rather stupid to be frank. </s>
<s> 's a horrible attempt to be retro-sheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional. </s>
<s> rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there is n't much in them. </s>
<s> actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink. </s>
<s> had to put my make-up on using the toliet for 5-days. </s>
<s> also took me 10-minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything. </s>
<s> had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee b 'c the bathroom doors are n't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan ! It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night. </s>
<s> a good note ; the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean. </s>
<s> 's about the only good thing I can say about this place. </s>
<s> would not go back. </s>
<s> Husband and I did not enjoy stay at Hotel Allegro ! The room was so small. </s>
<s> bathroom was ridiculously stupid ; everytime you use the sink you would splash water on yourself. </s>
<s> one person at time in the bathroom ; it was like being in an airplane 's bathroom. </s>
<s> walls are so thin ; we heard the people across hall having sex. </s>
<s> some staff were really rude. </s>
<s> did not appreciate it when we had a sign on the door saying do not disturb the day of our check out. </s>
<s> out time is 11am or 12 and we got a know on the door at 8AM with the sign stating " do not disturb. </s>
<s> The hotel did not have any microwaves in their rooms ; no mini fridge ; and no coffee maker either. </s>
<s> DRAWERS to put your clothes in and the closet was very very very tiny. </s>
<s> were there for four days and three nights ; so we had three suit cases full of clothes and no places to store them at. </s>
<s> also hated the fact that we had to pay almost fifty to park our car. </s>
<s> Husand and I will never stay at Hotel Allegro again ! in the windy city ; this is a very good place. </s>
<s> rooms and service. </s>
<s> is a walking distance . </s>
<s> absolute must for business trio as ease with which you can conduct and schedule meetings here is unbeatable. </s>
<s> decor and impishly modern My husband and I recently went to Chicago for my Aunt 's funeral. </s>
<s> are not familiar with the area so we asked for recommedations of where to stay for the two nights we would be in town. </s>
<s> were told to stay at the Ambassador East Hotel. </s>
<s> wish we could say that our experience there was a good one ; but sadly ; it was one of of the more disappointing travel experiences we have had. </s>
<s> check in we were quickly shown to our rooms ; but when we entered our king suite a very strong ; musty smell greeted us on the other side. </s>
<s> first I thought I was just being sensitive ; but after about an hour in the room we simply had to request to be moved. </s>
<s> smell was too overwhelming. </s>
<s> front desk said they would be happy to move us ; but the only other room available was a suite with two double beds ; rather than the king bed suite we originally reserved. </s>
<s> this was not exactly what we wanted ; we did n't really have a choice to refuse. </s>
<s> transfering to the new room and getting settled ; we discovered that the electrical outlet near the sink in the bathroom did not work. </s>
<s> this did not bother my husband too much ; I was very annoyed ; as I need the mirror while I use my hair dryer ; curling iron ; etc. </s>
<s> absolutely did not want to have to switch rooms yet again ; so I simply had to make due with doing my hair next to the bed. </s>
<s> also only gave us two towels of any kind in the bathroom ; so we had to request washcloths and small hand towels ; BOTH DAYS we were there ! Each time the housekeeping staff seemed incredibly annoyed at these requests. </s>
<s> what we paid to stay at this hotel ; we were not impressed at all. </s>
<s> customer service was lackluster and the rooms were not up to par. </s>
<s> you are ever in Chicago ; do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. </s>
<s> Hotel ! The staff is friendly ; corteous ; and professional. </s>
<s> made me feel like I was a returning guest which I was not ' but I will be !. </s>
<s> rooms were very clean and I slept well in the comfy bed. </s>
<s> have a complimentary workout deal with the nearby healthclub that I took advantage of several times since it was to cold to run outside. </s>
<s> only issue was the battery for the TV remote died. </s>
<s> ; a call to the front desk remedied that situation in about 2 minutes ! 5 stars ! I stayed at the InterContinental in Chicago for my visit to set up my Daughter 's wedding. </s>
<s> ' Our Daughter stated this was the place where all the higher echilon gets hitched ! Well I do n't understand why at all. </s>
<s> arrival we checked in and met Nina at the " The Bar " ' how innovative and had a light supper. </s>
<s> food was like airline food and cold. </s>
<s> waiter was annoying and in your face when he could clearly see we were not ready to have our food taken yet. </s>
<s> he finally came with the check we thought " our light supper " was all too pricey. </s>
<s> we were supposed to meet the sales manager Erin in the Lobby at 8 : 00 PM sharp. </s>
<s> sharp enough. </s>
<s> 8 : 15 a worker came over to us and stated that Erin had an emergency and would n't be able to meet with us tonight. </s>
<s> that is just great. </s>
<s> $ 300 for a night and supper that would obviously be wasted. </s>

<s> area is pleasant nice and clean ; minute walk to magnificant mile ; easy to walk around to the lake. </s>
<s> stuff ; very clean ; great warm hotel to stay in. </s>
<s> it does not have the " big hotel " factory-like feeling - more like home : My family booked five nitghts at the Omni Chicago for our upcoming spring break. </s>
<s> took advantage of a pre-paid ; non-cancellable offer. </s>
<s> subsequently received a " Bed Breakfast " offer via email and immediately called the hotel to inquire whether we could switch our reservation ' same dates ; different offer. </s>
<s> called the 800 number and the customer services representative was so obnoxiously condescending and ignorant ; we simply hung up. </s>
<s> had been looking forward to our vacation ; but now I am not sure I made the right choice with this hotel. </s>
<s> should have paid closer attention to the reviews - the Ritz ; the Four Seasons ; and the Peninsula would have never treated us this way. </s>
<s> will post again after our stay on April 17th. </s>
<s> stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel this past summer for 5 days and it was the worst hotel experience I have ever had ! Firstly ; the sheets that were on the bed seemed as if they were the same ones the previous guests had left on there ; they looked dingy or just plain dirty. </s>
<s> ; I went to function one night and came back in late so I was really tired the next morning ; hence I slept in late. </s>
<s> put the " Do Not Disturb " sign on my door and the room service still came knocking down my door asking if they can come and clean. </s>
<s> ; the room service lady ca n't read. </s>
<s> ; and worst of them all ; when I checked I was only allowed valet parking so I gave up my keys hoping to get back my car in one piece. </s>
<s> ; the next morning when I asked for my car to be retrieved ; there was a big dent in the driver 's door of my 2010 Mustang ! I was livid and the valet guy was insisting that he got it like that. </s>
<s> the end I had to get my door repaired on my own ! The only thing I liked there was the food and it was n't even all that. </s>
<s> was so disappointed and so I 'm warning everyone to think twice before you make a reservation. </s>
<s> hotel does not live up to the reviews. </s>
<s> room was larger than I expected. </s>
<s> ; the decor was a bit dated. </s>
<s> bedding was ripped ; carpet was stained ; and the shower door was broken. </s>
<s> was a long wait to the elevators ; and if you 're on floors 2-6 you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym. </s>
<s> main issue I had was the attitude I received from the staff. </s>
<s> was literally only ONE nice person at the front desk. </s>
<s> are no ice machines in this building ; so you have to request it from the front desk. </s>
<s> day I requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person. </s>
<s> minutes later I made a follow up call because I did not receive my ice. </s>
<s> was nastily told that ice takes 10 minutes and I should just wait. </s>
<s> finally got the ice 10 minutes later. </s>
<s> days later I requested ice again. </s>
<s> 30 minutes and just gave up. </s>
<s> I was leaving ; I mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said " I did n't get a call for ice. </s>
<s> " 
Well I obviously was n't making it up ; lady ! I called and spoke with someone. </s>
<s> did n't even apologize or offer me anything. </s>
<s> ; I would not recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> are so many hotels in the Chicago area. </s>
<s> a different one. </s>
<s> recently had the opportunity to stay at the Conrad Chicago Hotel ; located on North Rush Street. </s>
<s> part of the Hilton hotel chain ; I was confident that I would have a positive experience. </s>
<s> ; from the time I walked in the door until the time I checked out ; I was plagued with nothing but problems. </s>
<s> I walked into the hotel ; I was not greeted by the concierge ; which is usually a bad sign. </s>
<s> He was reading a newspaper. </s>
<s> '
Then ; when I announced that I was holding a reservation ; they desk clerk was unable to find it. </s>
<s> had a confirmation number which they agreed matched a number in their system ; but they could not find the room I had reserved. </s>
<s> ; they assigned me a room ; but it was smaller than I had originally requested and it had a bad odor. </s>
<s> was very disappointed with the room and its decor. </s>
<s> room smelled of stale smoke ; even though it was on a non-smoking floor. </s>
<s> bedspread was threadbare and there was no soap in the bathroom. </s>
<s> had to keep checking to make sure I was really at the Conrad Chicago. </s>
<s> ; this was not the way the Hilton chain operates ! There continued to be problem throughout my stay. </s>
<s> asked for a wake-up call and it was 15 minutes late ; which had me scurrying around so I could make my business meeting. </s>
<s> ordered breakfast to be brought to my room ; and it never showed up -- at all ! And the water for my shower never reached anything by lukewarm ; so my shower was short and unsatisfying. </s>
<s> decided to check out of the Conrad Chicago a day earlier than originally planned because I was so dissatisfied with the hotel and the way it attempted to resolve the problems and issues. </s>
<s> my return home ; I wrote a letter to the hotel manager ; but never received a reply. </s>
<s> they refused to acknowledge that I had problems ; I will not be staying at the Conrad Chicago again ; and will avoid all Hilton Hotels in the future. </s>
<s> ' I stayed at the Millennium in Chicago for a few days last month. </s>
<s> ; it was n't the luxury vacation I was hoping for. </s>
<s> started off kind of rocky right from when I checked in. </s>
<s> hotel did n't have my Hotwire reservation on record. </s>
<s> when I ordered room service for dinner it took over an hour for them to deliver my food. </s>
<s> the accommodations were pretty nice ; it was n't worth the steep price I was paying for my suite. </s>
<s> experience at Hotel Monaco was wonderful. </s>
<s> fiancee and I stayed two nights in the Tranquility suite -- absolutely exquisite ! We had wonderful room service and practically never had to leave our room. </s>
<s> Except to go to the gym : I was able to do yoga on the trip because they had yoga accessories in the room ! I was surprised by that. </s>
<s> hotel was the definition of ' luxury ; they had anything we needed and more. </s>
<s> fiancee said we were staying at a really ' nice hotel but I had no idea until we walked in the door. </s>
<s> soon as you walk in you are met with the charming atmosphere and luxurious decor. </s>
<s> have to admit ; cheesy as it may sound ; I felt like a queen all weekend long : Most of the time I have at least one problem with the hotel I stayed at ; but I have to say at this point I have no complaints at all about Hotel Monaco and I will definitely look forward to staying there again during my next trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> visited the Hotel Allegro Chicago while I was on vacation with my daughter. </s>
<s> booked the room and was very excited because the website alludes to a very lavish interior with amenities far superior to the surrounding hotels. </s>
<s> was particularly excited there was a fitness center because I work out on a regular basis and I would not have to give that up on my vacation. </s>
<s> me start by saying the staff was very rude and I was very dissappointed they could not respect that I was very tired after traveling a very long way. </s>
<s> booked the hotel stay for over a week ; which was very expensive ; and that seemed to not matter to them at ALL ; despite that fact that I was travelling with a small child as well ! They did nothing to accommodate me ; and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she " did n't know the area " To tope it all off ; the fitness center was under construction so I never got to use it. </s>

<s> I arrived I was greeted or really snarled at by the Clerk. </s>
<s> lady ' if one can really call this beast that was aggressive and rude from the get go. </s>
<s> made a snide comment on the number of bags I had and it was downhill from there. </s>
<s> guaranteed and confirmed reservation had been mysteriously cancelled and she indicated that I had been the one to contact their call center seeking a cancellation. </s>
<s> informed " Brenda " that I had never cancelled my reservation. </s>
<s> had originally booked 2 rooms ' one for me and one for colleague and my colleague changed their reservation to come in one day later. </s>
<s> huffed and puffed and finally said ; oh okay ; I read it wrong but we do n't have a room for you. </s>
<s> room had been given away to someone else that had arrived earlier that day. </s>
<s> a Hilton Honors member and someone that drops lots of money on this chain ; I was furious. </s>
<s> said that perhaps someone else had found me a room at another hotel and to wait while she checked. </s>
<s> left the front desk and was gone for almost 20 minutes ; coming back with a smirk on her face. </s>
<s> informed me that I had to make a decision and that both would not be satisfactory 100 %. </s>
<s> first option was to stay at a hotel outside of the Chicago downtown ; closer to the airport or that I could go with another room they had ; a smaller smoking one with the potential but promise of an upgrade in 3 or 4 days. </s>
<s> was outraged. </s>
<s> ; I 'm sorry and certainly the options were horrible. </s>
<s> ended up taking the smoking room where I barely spent any time in it due to the strong cigarette smells. </s>
<s> ; there was no upgrade at all during my stay there. </s>
<s> was not offered anything to make up for my troubles ; their screw-up nor did the hotel manager bother to return my call. </s>
<s> net outcome : I will NEVER stay at this hotel again and I 'm thinking of shredding my Hilton Honors card. </s>
<s> n't make the mistake of dealing with this property. </s>
<s> will be very ; very sorry. </s>
<s> for reading all this. </s>

<s> will definetly go to this hotel many more times when i am in the area ! I would definetly recommend it ! Having booked the hotel directly with the hotel on its website ; I arrived tired from Ireland ; to find that they had mislaid my booking and had no room on that night ; but did have rooms for the rest of the week. </s>
<s> booked me in to another ' not as nice downtown hotel and paid for my taxi to that hotel and for that nights accommodation. </s>
<s> my return to the hotel next day ; I was upgraded to the Club level. </s>
<s> really impressed me was that the hotel did everything they could to make up for their earlier mistake . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> unprompted. </s>
<s> course ; the hotel itself ' particularly on the 32nd floor is excellent. </s>
<s> will definitely be back. </s>
<s> my recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago ; I was severely disappointed in the quality of the facility and its staff. </s>
<s> start off ; the rooms did not provide an adequate sound barrier between rooms. </s>
<s> to spend a quiet evening after a long day of business meetings ; I had hoped to spend a quiet night in. </s>
<s> neighbors ; however ; watching what I can only imagine was a Real House Wives of New Jersey marathon on full volume ; destroyed my chance for peaceful ambiance. </s>
<s> I asked the concierge to address the issue ; he seemed more concerned about his texting than doing his job. </s>
<s> I visited the gym ; I found their " state-of-the-art " StayFitTM gym consisted in nothing more than a couple of treadmills ; weights and yoga mats. </s>
<s> water in the cooler was quite warm ; and the workout towels were stained and tattered. </s>
<s> ; all the hypo-allergenic features touted on their website were rendered null by the presence of dust balls under the beds. </s>
<s> Chicago - I stayed at Hotel Hilton in Chicago in June last year ; when I was on a holiday with friends. </s>
<s> was a very disappointing experience. </s>
<s> reached close to midnight and there was no one at the reception area to attend to us although we had pre-booked our rooms online a week before the arrival. </s>
<s> had to wait for almost an hour before we finally checked-in. </s>
<s> rooms were unkempt and the beds were not organized. </s>
<s> was shocking to find the sheets on the bed dirty and our request to get them changed was not answered for a couple hours. </s>
<s> television set in the room although was a latest model simply did not work. </s>
<s> bathroom attached along with the room was not up to the mark and looked unhygienic. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely not come back. </s>
<s> accompanied my husband on a business trip to Chicago back in September and we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel. </s>
<s> place was absolutely oozing with old-fashioned charm ! Also ; there were plenty of shopping opportunities within walking distance ; so I shopped while my husband worked. </s>
<s> just does n't get any better than that ! I loved the service we received and the ambiance of that grand old hotel ; and I 'd definitely stay there again ! The Conrad Chicago was by far the best experience I have ever had in travel leisure. </s>
<s> only was the room beautifully decorated and very comfortable ; but the food in the restaurant was exquisite. </s>
<s> to mention the perfect service from the resort 's employees ! I was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs. </s>
<s> 'm naturally a fitness freak ; so I was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the 11th floor. </s>
<s> of all ; it was available to guests at any time ; day or night. </s>
<s> resort was conveniently located by a large shopping area ; so it was n't a far walk to scope out the shops. </s>
<s> most memorable part of my stay was looking out at the city after dark and seeing how gorgeous Chicago looks all lit up. </s>
<s> was so relaxing just watching the city come to life. </s>
<s> was very disappointed when I had to pack and leave. </s>
<s> time that I make my way back to Chicago ; you better believe I will be staying at the Conrad Chicago. </s>
<s> recommend this resort to everyone I know who does a lot of traveling. </s>
<s> place is a dump. </s>
<s> booked on Priceline ; because the last time I booked a Priceline hotel in Chicago ; I got the Westin and loved it. </s>
<s> having paid for Priceline ; I ate the money I had already spent and called for a reservation at the Westin and went there for the weekend ; instead. </s>
<s> did n't regret it for a second. </s>
<s> will be disappointed if you stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker because you are paying for a Holiday Inn at the price of a Westin when you could have the real deal for just a little more. </s>
<s> location is not worth the place being old and so unimpressive. </s>
<s> are enough hotels near the loop ' and near a train 'bus stop if you need to move around the city inexpensively that you should not spend the money on the Millenium. </s>
<s> not waste your time and stay here -- this is a trap because of its location ; but it 's not worth it. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> hotel. </s>
<s> for the weekend with my wife and had a wonderful time. </s>
<s> hotel is one of the cleanest well kept hotels i have stayed at. </s>
<s> location on michigan ave downtown chicago overlooking grant park beautifull scenery. </s>
<s> staff and wonderfull food as well ; i would recomend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a nice vacation or going for work. </s>
<s> was very satisfied after staying at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. </s>
<s> service was excellent ; as the staff was very helpful and polite. </s>
<s> beds were very comfortable ; and the rooms were very spacious. </s>
<s> will definitely be returning to this hotel. </s>
<s> initial thought of the hotel was ; this place is just ok ; I didnt look up any reviews as I was staying there with 2 other friends. </s>
<s> was truly impressed from ceiling to floor with the room. </s>
<s> were good ; its just the surrounding buildings unless your towards the front where the river is located. </s>
<s> 'm crazy about huge bathrooms and this one is HUGE. </s>
<s> love all the space they have. </s>
<s> tv ; traditional seating and I admired the fabric-based headboards. </s>
<s> are very nice ! Walking distance to restaurants were convenient. </s>
<s> 'm a highly frequent traveler to Chicago almost 20 years now and always stay with relatives. </s>
<s> any event ; I 'd recommend staying at the Monaco again ! I was very disappointed with the hotel this time. </s>
<s> seem to be coming down in quality quite a bit. </s>
<s> clientele also seem to be of a lower quality. </s>
<s> lobby was quite a rambunctious scene with no one on staff seeming to notice. </s>
<s> house keeper only did the bare minimum in the room each day and did not replace the used toiletries or the coffee ; she also left the dirty coffee cups in the room. </s>
<s> think I will have to stay with the InterContinental next time. </s>
<s> vacationed at the Fairmont Chicago for 3 nights in July 2009. </s>
<s> room ; the bathroom ; the view ; and the staff were all wonderful. </s>
<s> just wish the hotel were a few blocks North ' on MI Ave. </s>
<s> ; when you 're tired ; that extra couple of blocks seem like miles ! I stayed at the the Conrad Chicago Hotel last winter with my family and I could n't be happier with are choice. </s>
<s> staff was very polite and helpfull and the rooms were very comfortable and felt like home. </s>
<s> loved the area of chicago the hotel was in there wasnt alot of crim around and i felt safe being in a new city. </s>
<s> would never stay here again. </s>
<s> a hotel that calls itself a four-diamond hotel ; it can not even provide the most basic amenities and services. </s>
<s> would have been more comfortable staying in a run-down motel. </s>
<s> bathroom had not been cleaned properly and the sheets were stained. </s>
<s> Review of the Hard Rock Hotel- I find that the Hard Rock Hotel ; located in Chicago ; has extrodinary scenary. </s>
<s> hotel is extremely clean with shining furniture and the rooms are breathtaking. </s>
<s> ? Visit this hotel for yourself to see what excellence they provide at the dinner tables. </s>
<s> hotel also host events such as ballet ; fun in the bar and a dj to name a few. </s>
<s> hotel is definitely worth your while. </s>
<s> will most definitely visit again. </s>
<s> your reservation as soon as possible and do n't forget your camera ! I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco and I must say ; it has become one of my favorite hotels in the windy city. </s>
<s> the past ; I 've always stayed at the Marriott or the Hilton so this time I thought I 'd go with a boutique hotel. </s>
<s> 've stayed at some of the Kimpton properties in San Francisco so I was delighted that they are running the Monaco. </s>
<s> ; I like the friendly ; real-people atmosphere as opposed to the corporate style places I 've used before. </s>
<s> do work out and they had a decent fitness center with the treadmill I normally use. </s>
<s> Water Kitchen served a terrific meal even in a city of great restaurants. </s>
<s> really dug the complimentary coffee ; high speed internet and newspaper. </s>
<s> get tired of being nickel and dimed by the corporate hotels and liked the fact that the Monaco offered a bunch of freebies -- especially liked the afternoon wine service. </s>
<s> in all ; I will return to the Monaco. </s>
<s> 's a great alternative. </s>
<s> wife and I stayed at this hotel at the end of May ; 2009. </s>
<s> came for the weekend for a function and we extended the trip to take in the city. </s>
<s> got a deal on this hotel through TravelZoos. </s>
<s> 249 'night stay for $ 99 'night plus we got the full buffet breakfast. </s>
<s> room was wonderful. </s>
<s> large King size bed with expansive sitting area. </s>
<s> are used to smaller hotels with little room to move. </s>
<s> bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows. </s>
<s> wear or damage in room at all except sink tap dripped a bit ' poor taps. </s>
<s> could have upgraded to river view for $ 20 'night but chose not to. </s>
<s> enjoyed the room for what it was. </s>
<s> floor looking south. </s>
<s> buffet breakfast was great. </s>
<s> to choose from and very fresh with made to order eggs ; non stop coffee and juice and the servers were so eager to please. </s>
<s> to have breakfast included in night stay. </s>
<s> be a bit dear to pay at $ 22 'person. </s>
<s> was nice to sit and relax with good breakfast ; coffee and newspaper and not have to figure where to catch a morning meal. </s>
<s> desk was most helpful in suggesting places to eat ; always informative and ready to provide maps ; directions ; multiple suggestions and even make the reservations. </s>
<s> included to admit without paying cover charges at some jazz clubs. </s>
<s> was great. </s>
<s> from El and other transportation and easy walking distance to the parks and right on the river. </s>
<s> in Chicago again ; would not hesitate to stay here again. </s>
<s> swimming pool would have been nice but we did not miss it. </s>
<s> did n't stay in the hotel a lot because we went for the sites not the room. </s>
<s> that ; we picked this hotel because it was the cheapest but the hotel not having any parking we spent money on parking our car than what we could have spent on a better more expensive hotel with parking. </s>
<s> is great for guys getaway weekend that wo n't have a car. </s>
<s> a family frienly hotel. </s>
<s> tip : Long walk from hotel Gino 's pizza is a must have ! Worth the walk. </s>
<s> things in between hotel and Gino 's to do so you can break up the walk. </s>
<s> Hotel - Talbott hotel is like our home away from home. </s>
<s> we visit chicago ; we stay there only. </s>
<s> is close to Michigan Ave and the famed Water Tower. </s>
<s> price is an excellent factor considering the amenities provided. </s>
<s> our last stay ; the staff was very helpful ; they upgraded our room to king size considering our repetitive stay. </s>
<s> rooms are spacious ; clean and bright. </s>
<s> would highly recommend Talbott. </s>
<s> a fabulous hotel ! From its location directly on the Magnificant Mile and surrounded by the finest shopping ; to the curtious staff and excellent restaurants and bars ; this hotel is one of the best in Chicago. </s>
<s> room was very clean and fresh ; the public areas comfortable and the staff at the concierge and front desk very extremely helpful. </s>
<s> is the only place to stay to be in the cnetre of the action in Chicago. </s>
<s> RECOMMENDED ! ' Hilton Chicago- When we arrived at the Hilton Chicago we expected a reasonably nice chain hotel for our stay in Chicago. </s>
<s> price online seemed pretty reasonable and the location seemed to be pretty good. </s>
<s> were we wrong. </s>
<s> were nickled and dimed at every turn. </s>
<s> is ridiculous even for a city at $ 45 a day for self parking. </s>
<s> advertise free wifi but read the fine print and realize that is only in the lobby or shell out a hundred extra for business class rooms. </s>
<s> felt like I was still in the airport being charged for every little thing. </s>
<s> hotel itself is the hotel equivalent of a McMansion : it tries hard to look like something high class but a second glance shows a somewhat pedestrian lobby space that has high vaulted ceilings and faux paintings to pretend to be a true luxury hotel. </s>
<s> room itself was reasonably sized ; for a lower end hotel. </s>
<s> I am paying up for a Hilton I expect more than the bare bones. </s>
<s> room had a view of an alley. </s>
<s> we asked to be switched to a lake view room we were told the upgrade would be an additional fee. </s>
<s> also say they are centrally located but central to what ? The hotel is near Grant Park but any other part of the city is an L ride away at least. </s>
<s> the L is fantastic ; a city like Chicago is best observed by walking ; though it would be best if you avoid breaking a sweat or you will need to rinse off in the phone booth sized shower. </s>
<s> the Hilton provides a hardly passable experience where you will walk away feeling like your pocket was picked for a weak product. </s>
<s> would first like to say how inviting the rooms themselves are. </s>
<s> my wife and I ; we enjoy the warmer colors. </s>
<s> along with excellent staff ; made me feel away from home yet relaxed. </s>
<s> right Downtown was perfect for location. </s>
<s> suites are very quiet as well. </s>
<s> surprised my wife with the " Shopping Package " . </s>
<s> a hit ! Thanks Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown ! My stay at the Sofitel was great. </s>
<s> loved the location it was in. </s>
<s> the moment I arrived the experince was great ; the attendants were helpful and the front desk was too. </s>
<s> thought the room was elegant and very clean as well as comfortable. </s>
<s> room service was excllent and they were very friendly. </s>
<s> was a breeze and I couldnt ask for anything more in a hotel stay. </s>
<s> Hilton Hotel helped us make the most of our trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> only are they centrally located near most of Chi towns hot spots ; but they also helped coordinate discounted admissions to various other attractions. </s>
<s> Hilton is very classy with their accommodations. </s>
<s> will be returning at my earliest convenience ; be it for business or pleasure. </s>
<s> - I was not impressed with this hotel. </s>
<s> have stayed at other hotels in the Chicago area in the past and Fairmont Chicago pales in comparison to those. </s>
<s> checking in ; I noticed that the room had not been cleaned and only the bed was made. </s>
<s> ; the tables had cigarette burns on it. </s>
<s> inspecting the bathroom ; I found out that the bathroom doors did not close properly. </s>
<s> I tried to get some work done ; I had trouble with the spotty wi-fi because I kept getting disconnecting after every few minutes. </s>
<s> the bed was comfortable ; I could not get much sleep due to the street-level noise of vehicles and people. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel at all and will definitely stay at another hotel the next time I 'm in Chicago. </s>
<s> wife and I live in the Western Suburbs of Chicago. </s>
<s> our anniversary ; we booked a night at the Fairmont based on recommendations from friends. </s>
<s> the staff of the hotel was quite friendly and helpful and the location ideal for a night out in the city ; the accommodations themselves were not up to our expectations. </s>
<s> starters ; we requested a non-smoking room which we did receive. </s>
<s> ; the hallway leading up to our room had a distinctive smell of smoke which certainly was a turn off for both of us. </s>
<s> the room was certainly adequate ; the bathroom light had a distinct flicker and there was no complementary shampoo included. </s>
<s> the latter may seem like a minor offense ; it is not what one expects from hotel of such reported quality. </s>
<s> ; the cost of parking seemed to be somewhat inflated even for Chicago 's standards. </s>
<s> summary ; the Fairmont is a decent quality hotel but for the price ; I am sure we could of done better. </s>
<s> Chicago-I did not like my stay at the James. </s>
<s> was a bit too noisy on the lower floors ' we were fourth ; facing away from the lake ; and the water pressure was not very good on the showers. </s>
<s> management did try to alleviate the situation with the showerhead ; but they got to our request on the third day of our stay. </s>
<s> only plus was that the location was pretty good ; we were by the Lake and a couple blocks northeast of the El. </s>
<s> ; for the price ; it was not worth it. </s>
<s> Chicago - When planning my last visit to Chicago ; I looked at many hotels but quickly focused on the Allegro mainly because I felt that a 4 star hotel for under $ 200 a night was a very good deal. </s>
<s> ; after having spent a couple of nights there ; I can assure you it is. </s>
<s> was a leisure trip ; half to spend time with friends and half to see how the city had changed in the last 2 years since I visited it and so I wanted to try to get a separate living suite so my friends ' who do n't live in the downtown area could spend more time with me. </s>
<s> the King Suite at the Allegro made this trip a lot easier and more fun. </s>
<s> separate living suite allowed me to spend more time with my friends after we had hit the bars and clubs ; and they could actually spend the night in my room comfortably. </s>
<s> was n't possible in pretty much all the other hotels I 've stayed at. </s>
<s> from that ; the hotel is of pretty standard quality as far as 4 star hotels go ; and I could n't tell you much about the location since I like to walk about cities. </s>
<s> ; the separate living area in a 4 star hotel all for under $ 350 was a great deal ; rooms like that usually go for hundreds more. </s>
<s> stayed two nights at the Hilton Chicago. </s>
<s> was the last time I will be staying there. </s>
<s> I arrived ; I could not believe that the hotel did not offer free parking. </s>
<s> wanted at least $ 10. </s>
<s> am I paying for when I stay there for the night ? The website also touted the clean linens. </s>
<s> room was clean and I believe the linens were clean. </s>
<s> problem was with all of the down pillows etc. </s>
<s> n't they know that people have allergies ? I also later found out that this hotel allows pets. </s>
<s> think that this was another part of my symptoms. </s>
<s> you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks I suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay. </s>
<s> did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking. </s>
<s> hidden costs. </s>
<s> will try somewhere else in the future. </s>
<s> worth the money or the sneezing all night. </s>
<s> want to issue a travel-warning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time : The deal says " free breakfast " included in the price. </s>
<s> ; what they do n't tell you ; is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit ' or two ! Moreover ; you need to ask for these " tickets " at the lobby when you check in - they wo n't give them to you automatically ! We stayed there over Christmas ' 03 ; and we ; and I noticed several guests who bought the same package ; had a rather unpleasant experience ! The hotel is nice though ; if you do n't consider their lousy service ! I would not recommend this hotel. </s>

<s> were celebrating our anniversary ; so we decided to splurge on the Prestige Suite. </s>
<s> to the website ; we were to be given either a city or park view ; neither of which we had. </s>
<s> ; our room was overlooking a dirty field with some sparse trees. </s>

<s> husband requested that we be given another room ; preferably a clean one ; but the clerk told us that there were no other rooms available. </s>
<s> given the chance ; I would not stay at this hotel again ; even if I were offered a free night. </s>
<s> stayed 2 nights over spring break in what was called a Jr Suite but resembled a wide hallway with a window at one end. </s>
<s> cheap furniture ; carpet that stops short of reaching the wall ; a TV that sticks out into the middle of the room and a window that whistled when the wind blew. </s>

<s> was magnificent. </s>
<s> got a great deal and I am so happy that I stayed here. </s>
<s> arriving I was nervous as I had read a few bad reviews about the impact the renovation was having on peoples stay ; for example very noisy. </s>

<s> room was huge ; bathroom was spacious with excellent water pressure ; bed was perfect and the view was amazing. </s>
<s> is so close to the great shops of Magnificent Mile ; plus a comfortable walking distance to Hancock tower and Millennium Park. </s>
<s> stayed at the hotel during the Dave Matthews Caravan tour and would come home each night rather dusty 'dirty from being at an outdoor concert with 200 ; 000 of my closest friends. </s>
<s> used half a bottle of shampoo the first night. </s>
<s> second night ; the staff had not refreshed my bar soap or shampoo. </s>
<s> informed the front desk who made apologies and said they would take care of it immediately. </s>
<s> got home that night with a tiny tiny bar of soap ' hand soap for the bath 'shower and they had replaced the shampoo in its original place ; nicely displayed ; but with the EXACT SAME bottle of shampoo that was now 1 '8 full. </s>

<s> great hotel ; we used the CTA the 2 days we were in Chicago and it is great ; that the Line 6 stops nearly in front of the hotel. </s>

What a gorgeous hotel ! From the moment we stepped inside the warm colors of the lobby made us feel welcome at the Sheraton and in Chicago. </s>
<s> heavenly beds made the view from our room that much better ; and to top it off with great restaurants ; you could n't ask a hotel for more ! Starbucks coffee in the rooms were just an extra touch that guarantees we 'll be back every time we visit Chicago. </s>
<s> arrived at 10 : 30 am on a Friday ; and they had a room ready for us by 11 : 30 am ; mind you check in is not until 3 : 00pm. </s>

<s> were not children ; they were adults. </s>
<s> do n't know why everyone complains about $ 48 for parking. </s>

<s> do n't know why there are so many bad reviews on this hotel. </s>
<s> ; it 's a big hotel. </s>

<s> just got back from the Monaco in Chicago ! I was very pleasantly surprised ; as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway ; and he usually picks bad places-haha. </s>
<s> ; the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated. </s>
<s> was busy and the line was a little long ; but it moved quickly. </s>
<s> lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good ; especially since it seemed to be near full. </s>
<s> room was clean and spacious ' especially considering it 's a city hotel. </s>
<s> made a lot of use of the concierge ; since again ; it was so last minute we did n't really make any plans. </s>
<s> gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy ! It was also great being near the theater district ; and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare. </s>
<s> thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room ! very trendy. </s>
<s> husband is not as easily impressed ; but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon. </s>
<s> ; really nice stay in a four star ; or probably four and half star hotel ! This hotel was great - In a great area right downtown and close to everything. </s>
<s> daily happy hour had great food ; wine and premium liquors. </s>
<s> free breakfast was even better ! Actually I believe everything was included breakfast 'happy hour 'business center 'WiFi. </s>
<s> room was a king size facing the back of the building. </s>
<s> clean new and comfortable. </s>
<s> touches such as books and cds to enjoy made the room feel less like a hotel - Would highly recommend. </s>
<s> reading the reviews on this hotel ; I decided to book my stay for July 4th weekend here and I am glad I did ; this hotel is absolutely beautiful. </s>
<s> suite was gorgeous it is a very romantic hotel with big sit in picture windows. </s>
<s> do have 1 complaint. </s>
<s> bar is very boring and the resturant is not that great ; but other than that I loved it. </s>
<s> would definitely stay there again. </s>

<s> beds were surprisingly comfortable ; with interesting covers. </s>
<s> TVs were HD ; which was a step up from most hotels i have stayed at before. </s>
<s> was a cool martini bar that I spent an hour at one night ; which was enjoyable ; especially because of the live jazz band My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend and it was great. </s>
<s> check-in staff changed our room to a single bed without question ; and the bar served the best martini I have had in a while. </s>
<s> rooms were well decorated and spacious ; although it did get a little tight through the bathroom door. </s>
<s> bell staff was very accomodating and walked my wife up to our room when she arrived late. </s>
<s> would definitely stay here again ! If you are looking for a hotel that is truly in the best location ; the Intercontinental is it -- right on the Magnificent Mile ; next to the Chicago River ; across from the Wrigley Building. </s>
<s> daughter and I stayed here for a getaway ; and quickly were able to get to Milennium Park ; shopping ; Navy Pier ; great dining ; exploring festivals and strolling through beautiful areas along the lakefront and Chicago River. </s>

<s> Palmer House is over 130 years old. </s>

Sir or Madam : I am writing to give feedback about our recent stay the Amalfi. </s>
<s> were a guest from 11 '20 to 11 '23. </s>
<s> our stay we used the " Valet " Service operated through Standard Parking. </s>
<s> vehicle was returned with stolen items from the glove compartments. </s>
<s> to my chagrin ; $ 44 'day valet service did not include proper security 'monitoring ; despite the premium over " self park " . </s>
<s> understand that these parking services are sub-contracted by the hotel ; but I would think that any worthy hotel would remedy the situation. </s>
<s> was not the case. </s>
<s> hope that your staff will be able to take measures to rectify the situation for future guests Conrad Chicago ; " This hotel has a mediocre service. </s>
<s> ordered for room service and it arrived very late and there was n't an apology also. </s>
<s> room had no coffee maker and we had to make a trip to the restaurant to have coffee or tea. </s>
<s> Internet service was free but it did n't make any difference as it was so slow that I used my personal internet dongle to browse the web. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel to anyone. </s>
<s> " 
My husband and I recently stayed at the Conrad Chicago for three nights ; a Thursday through Saturday. </s>
<s> me say we were less than pleased with our experience. </s>
<s> chose to stay in the " King Bed Deluxe Room " and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations. </s>
<s> entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly ; the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser. </s>
<s> room was size was average ; and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room. </s>
<s> major annoyance was how loud people were. </s>
<s> came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running. </s>
<s> is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel. </s>
<s> can expect a loud guest maybe once ; but every night is ridiculous. </s>
<s> service was also extremely sub par. </s>
<s> had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work. </s>
<s> day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me. </s>
<s> completely disregarded the sign ; did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in. </s>
<s> scared me and I 'm just glad I was not getting out of the shower or changing. </s>
<s> to sum up ; we will never stay at the Conrad again ; we will never recommend it to anyone else ; and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in Chicago. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> is a place to NEVER hold an event. </s>
<s> ; no one smiles ; including the bartenders. </s>
<s> n't anyone here know they are in the HOSPITALITY business ? The bartender was 54 years old. </s>
<s> do I know that ? Because ; she stated to another employee that " when you get to be 54 years old ; you tell it like it is. </s>
<s> " 
Very specifically ; she was referring to the fact that she could tell her employers how they should run things. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> room was set up the wrong way for the event. </s>
<s> food was just plain bad. </s>
<s> 9 at a Ponderosa would have been as good. </s>
<s> ; this is the Swisshotel. </s>
<s> ; let 's go back to the bartender telling us ; unsolicited ; about all the problems with the hotel. </s>
<s> ; you just have to wonder how a place like this stays in business. </s>
<s> 50 for valet. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> asking you if you need something ; like help ? No. </s>
<s> management make excuses ? You bet. </s>
<s> you ever want to hold an event here ? Big no. </s>
<s> would like to add a comment ; maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination. </s>
<s> daughter was married in May of 2010 and we decided to have the special event at the Sofitel Water Tower ; we were amazed. </s>
<s> always wanted a ballroom type of wedding ; and Sofitel made this happen for her. </s>
<s> took care of all the invitations ; cake decor ; and so much more. </s>
<s> special day for my daughter was worth everything. </s>
<s> you are going to be in the Chicago area ; check them out ; you will not regret it ! I had an awful experience here. </s>
<s> staff were rude and unhelpful. </s>
<s> took forever to check in and when I did ; they took a while to even find my reservation. </s>
<s> I got to the room ; it was marginally clean and when I complained ; they said they were full and could not do anything for me. </s>
<s> would never go back. </s>
<s> are obviously not worried about customer service. </s>
<s> hotel was very overpriced for what you get from staying here. </s>
<s> Amalfi Hotel Chicago advertises itself as a " luxury hotel " located in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> it is in downtown Chicago ; that means that I had street noises keeping me up most of the night. </s>
<s> view also suffered. </s>
<s> had nicer rooms available with better views ; but the markups to stay in them was outrageous ! The room itself was decent ; with clean linens and nice air conditioning ; but I can get that in just about any hotel these days. </s>
<s> was n't anything particularly luxurious about the hotel to make it a stand-out for me ; but for the price I paid for the room ; I certainly had that expectation. </s>
<s> was a let down. </s>
<s> Chicago is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. </s>
<s> in my life have I been treated so poorly as a guest. </s>
<s> front desk was very unaccommodating when I asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation. </s>
<s> was no bellhop available for some strange reason so I had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself. </s>
<s> it was n't already a bad stay ; I ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered. </s>
<s> they did n't have air conditioning in the room ; I would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable. </s>
<s> you are traveling to Chicago for any kind of business ; I hope you decide not to choose this hotel. </s>
<s> was quite surprised ; I like Chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience. </s>
<s> House A Hilton Hotel I was hesitant at first to book a room at the Palmer House ; but I decided to give it a try. </s>
<s> it was a high class hotel ; I did not find my stay to be worth the price I paid. </s>
<s> room was not much better than any other average hotel I have stayed at before. </s>
<s> was a pretty small room especially given the high cost. </s>
<s> food served at the Lockwood Restaurant was nothing special. </s>
<s> ; I thought it was outrageous that I had to make a reservation in order to go to the bar ; especially since I am a paying guest at the hotel. </s>
<s> the end ; I thought the Palmer House is a nice hotel but definitely not worth the amount of money I paid for my stay. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago with my wife. </s>
<s> was on business but I thought I 'd take her so we could see the city as well. </s>
<s> was great ; The Allegro . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> not so much. </s>
<s> mean it looked nice ; great lobby and all. </s>
<s> service was n't so great though. </s>
<s> clerk was a younger girl who seemed a bit rude. </s>
<s> we were bothering her and interrupting her day by wanting to book a weekend. </s>
<s> bell hop took our bags to our room ; none to gently. </s>
<s> wife and I watched as he threw our luggage on the floor in our room. </s>
<s> was n't that bad till he actually asked for a tip ! Our room was okay. </s>
<s> bed was sort of rough and made a odd plastic rubbing noise every time you moved. </s>
<s> next day my wife went out and returned to find our room was n't cleaned. </s>
<s> trip to the Chicago had it 's nice moments ; all outside the hotel. </s>
<s> Hotel Allegro seemed like they spent too much on the appearance and neglected to staff it better. </s>
<s> wo n't stay there again. </s>
<s> hotel is overpriced. </s>
<s> should pay money for luxury ; but they fall far short considering the prices that they charge. </s>
<s> you go to the hotel restaurants you expect a certain mark-up because ; yes ; they do have to make money. </s>
<s> the prices they charge for food that was okay makes little sense to me. </s>
<s> I got there and went to my room ; I thought that there would be nice colors ; a great view ; and deluxe bedding. </s>
<s> I got were sheets that might have come from the full price section of target -- they were not cheap ; but not that expensive either. </s>
<s> think I could have found something of this quality at less than the 200ish a night I paid. </s>
<s> stayed 2 nights at the Knickerbocker and could not have had a better stay. </s>
<s> hotel has recently renovated there rooms. </s>
<s> staff could not have been more friendly and helpful from Dave and Cora at the martini bar to Julie at the front desk who help out with an upgrade for us. </s>
<s> hotel has everything you need for your stay and is close to all the fun that Chicago offers. </s>
<s> pick for THE CITY is the Knickerbocker. </s>
<s> and JUDY. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed in the Hilton Chicago and had a very nice stay ! The rooms were large and comfortable. </s>
<s> view of Lake Michigan from our room was gorgeous. </s>
<s> service was really good and quick ; eating in the room looking at that view ; awesome ! The pool was really nice but we didnt get a chance to use it. </s>
<s> location for all of the downtown Chicago attractions such as theaters and museums. </s>
<s> friendly staff and knowledgable ; you cant go wrong staying here. </s>
<s> Intercontinental Chicago was not as great an experience as I was expecting it to be. </s>
<s> I first arrived the front desk staff could not find my reservation in the system. </s>
<s> then tried to make me book a higher paying room. </s>
<s> ended up having to ask for the manager ; who conveniently was able to locate a room for me with the same rate. </s>
<s> was expecting top notch service and class but apparently those services are reserved for the elite. </s>
<s> was not doted on as I should have been and found that I had long wait times when I placed an order with room service or needed the concierge. </s>
<s> the price I was paying to stay there I would have thought there would have been more of a catered and personal touch to the service. </s>
<s> great with a few islands of relatively minor problems. </s>
<s> the good : Outside of the hotel and lobby were decorated like a winter wonderland ; as befitted the season. </s>

<s> was large ; cozy ; and beautiful- especially loved the window seats with a great view of the river. </s>

<s> was not the Chicago I was hoping for. </s>
<s> addition to that ; it looked nothing like it did in the pictures on their website. </s>
<s> paint was faded and chipped ; there was a foul odor in the lobby and there was no staff to speak of. </s>
<s> we waited for 15 minutes at the front desk ; someone finally came and said that they did not have a reservation under our name. </s>
<s> a long trip ; I 'm sure you know how aggravating that was. </s>
<s> I got a manager that knew how to work the computer properly and he brought up our reservation. </s>
<s> we got to our room ; it was very small ; smelled like smoke and the carpet was severely stained with either wine or blood. </s>
<s> ; as we were walking to the room in the hallway ; a cockroach walked right across our path like he owned the place. </s>
<s> top it off it seemed everyone staying at the hotel was a gangster or a gambler and his lady for the night. </s>

<s> me just preface this by saying that I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel. </s>
<s> chose it largely for location as I do n't really love to walk that much and I was incredibly pleased with its situation in the city. </s>
<s> was just a couple blocks away from several museums and shopping districts but my husband and I mainly ventured out for food ; of which there were great options and the concierge was a great help. </s>
<s> had originally booked the King Guestroom but upon arrival were upgraded to the Deluxe King Guestroom by the front desk. </s>
<s> was remarkably friendly and helpful which is something I look for and remember when I go to stay in a location again. </s>
<s> room was amazing. </s>

<s> was n't one little spot of dust to be found. </s>
<s> bathroom was gorgeous and we made full use of the two bathrobes in the closet. </s>
<s> did n't take anything from the snack bar but it all looked delicious. </s>

<s> said they will fix it ; but I did not get any response. </s>

<s> god I got this hotel through priceline. </s>
<s> ca n't imagine paying full price for this place. </s>
<s> tub was moldy and dingy. </s>
<s> toilet did n't flush. </s>
<s> selection of TV channels was limited to say the least. </s>
<s> you wanted to pay $ 5 for a rerun of an NBC show. </s>
<s> ; and internet ? Why that will set you back about $ 15 for the day. </s>

<s> hotel is a big ; crummy rip-off. </s>
<s> will never stay here ' and will steer clear of Hyatts in general I believe. </s>
<s> Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a nice place to stay if you need a place to stay on quick notice ; but it certainly does not " exceed expectations " as touted on their website. </s>
<s> Starpoints system is somewhat complicated and not helpful for the frequent traveler. </s>
<s> Chic but not fussy " is an overstatement. </s>
<s> room was clean ; although the bed covering was wrinkled and the bathroom counter had water lying on it that appeared as though it had n't been cleaned since the last guest. </s>
<s> was hand lotion and shampoo samples ; but no soap sample. </s>
<s> bathroom was short on two towels and it took two calls to housekeeping to get this fixed. </s>
<s> Cheap " might have been a better adjective. </s>
<s> out was simple and not much hassle. </s>
<s> ; the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is fine in a pinch ; but next time ; I will research hotels a little better before making a decision and reserving a room. </s>
<s> live down the block from the hotel. </s>
<s> arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away. </s>
<s> floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night. </s>
<s> think the Ambassador East was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there. </s>
<s> the years I had had some visiting groups stay there. </s>
<s> had also eaten there and been to the bar but I had never stayed there myself. </s>
<s> lobby is elegant. </s>

<s> paid less than $ 100 including tax for one night. </s>
<s> am not sure what their regular rates are but I think my deal was the best travel bargain around. </s>
<s> wife and I stayed two nights at the Talbott at the end of February. </s>
<s> little hotel was the perfect place for us. </s>
<s> lobby is very small but also cozy ; and with both fireplaces going it was a welcoming atmosphere coming in from the cold. </s>
<s> staff was very friendly and efficient. </s>
<s> room was pretty spacious ; and the king bed was extremely comfortable. </s>
<s> had a seventh floor room facing delaware st ; so there was really no view. </s>
<s> bathroom was a good size ; including two sinks and a spacious tub 'shower. </s>
<s> was also free wireless internet . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> a big plus for us. </s>
<s> the best thing about the Talbott is the location. </s>
<s> were only a few steps from State ; Rush ; and North Michigan. </s>
<s> of shopping ; bars ; and good food are easily within walking distance. </s>
<s> makes the Talbott a great place for tourists who want to walk around and take everything in. </s>
<s> highly recommend the Talbott ; and will gladly stay again on return trips. </s>
<s> and my business associate had a job in Chicago and wanted to stay somewhere that had more features. </s>
<s> did some research online and came across the Hotel Moncaco. </s>
<s> decided to stay for 3 nights. </s>
<s> we arrived we noticed that it was in a busy part of the city with bright lights. </s>
<s> staff was upstiff ; and did n't not offer much hospitality. </s>
<s> room did have a view ; but of the city lights and kept our room bright ; even with the curtains closed. </s>

<s> third stay at the Homewood Suites Chicago proved to be just as great as the previous two. </s>
<s> staff are consistently friendly ; polite and professional - and this applies whether they are working at the front door ; servicing the rooms ; managing the breakfast room or on the reception desk. </s>
<s> genuinely seem happy to be working here and ca n't do enough for their guests. </s>
<s> rooms are large and clean and seem to have good insulation from each other ' we did n't hear a thing from our neighbours and the hotel was quite busy. </s>
<s> hotel is well placed for walking to the shops on Michigan Ave ; or catching a bus or subway. </s>
<s> is a Jewel Osco and a Trader Joes each within a couple of blocks ; which are perfect for stocking up on groceries etc. </s>
<s> husband heartily recommends ' Binnies Beverage Depot for a huge variety of beer. </s>
<s> all we need is an excuse to return to Chicago next year - then we can make it four years on the run at the Homewood Suites ; because we would n't stay anywhere else ! While the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago promises upscale accommodations and a unique experience ; they fail to deliver. </s>
<s> of course ; a unique experience includes being kept awake all night by a party in the room next door. </s>
<s> you plan on staying there for a chance to meet your favorite celebrity or musician you will be sorely disappointed. </s>
<s> " A " list celebrities will not be there. </s>
<s> fact ; it would be rare to find anyone on the " B " list either. </s>
<s> party that keeps you awake will not be your favorite band practicing for their next concert. </s>
<s> party is being held by the musicians that were not even able to gain work at a local coffee bar. </s>
<s> walls of the rooms are so thin you can hear every wrong note played. </s>
<s> for the promise of Art Deco ; it must have changed in definition. </s>
<s> room will truly look like a concert has just been held. </s>
<s> carpet smelled like it had been shampooed in beer. </s>
<s> bathroom lets just say that clean was not the correct description. </s>
<s> service and amenities were severely lacking. </s>
<s> are not greeted with warmth but with disdain. </s>
<s> not bother complaining about the noise next door either. </s>
<s> is part of you unique experience. </s>
<s> only part of the Hard Rock Hotel description that appeared to be accurate was that it is in a great location in Chicago. </s>
<s> was easy to find a real hotel to stay in for the rest your trip. </s>
<s> atmosphere at this hotel is truly remarkable ; it has a very modern feel. </s>
<s> rooms were very well designed ; and the beds are not your average hotel room beds by any means. </s>
<s> pillow top beds made an already relaxed and comfortable stay that much more enjoyable. </s>
<s> planned a fun time for our kids this summer by booking a kids suite at the Swissotel Chicago. </s>
<s> fun time was not exactly that. </s>
<s> arriving for our weekend getaway ; we find that the reservations we made online and the confirmation we held in our hand for a kids suite ; did not mean a thing. </s>
<s> ; there were none of the kids suites available. </s>
<s> kids suite is supposed to have things to keep the kids happy when they are in the room : coloring ; video games ; etc. </s>
<s> one at the front desk could explain to us why there were no kids suites available. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; we took a regular suite with the promise that we would be moved as soon as one became available. </s>
<s> what ? We spent the whole weekend in the same room. </s>
<s> ; the staff apologized ; but no one seemed overly concerned that our children were dissapointed and no compensation or extras were offered to make us less cranky about it. </s>
<s> than that and the fact the none of the hotel staff was very friendly ; the rooms were clean. </s>
<s> did not spend a lot of time in the hotel ; but I will not be booking a room here again. </s>
<s> staff did not impress me at all and we did not feel like we were treated well at all. </s>
<s> Chicago ; " I stayed in this hotel when I went to Chicago for vacation and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. </s>

<s> bad the hotel did n't have a spa or a pool. </s>
<s> provide free in-room internet service which is a plus. </s>
<s> Terrace restaurant was decent but it did n't have much vegetarian options. </s>
<s> concierge was very helpful in recommending the places to visit nearby. </s>
<s> hotel is located at a perfect place in the middle of Magnificent Mile ; very close to Michigan Ave which has a lot of wonderful shops. </s>

The Affinia in Chicago obviously caters to wedding guests and corporations hosting business conferences. </s>
<s> you do not represent one of these groups with a large number of guests and revenue for Affinia ; do not expect any measure of customer service and do n't expect great accommodations ; even at their high prices. </s>
<s> we arrived our reservation was lost ; then it took forever for the concierge to tell us the room we were instead given was available. </s>
<s> furnishings in the room were cheaply made ; the cleaning obviously superficial and our view was directly into the concrete wall of the hotel 's L shaped corridor. </s>
<s> called for fresh linens and toiletries and a very rude phone attendant told me someone would essentially be then when they had time. </s>
<s> hours later someone came. </s>
<s> dining hall and reception areas were really nice ; but again ; unless you 're a large group do n't expect to enjoy them during your stay at Affinia. </s>

<s> chose the hotel for it 's close proximity to Navy Pier and otherwise central location. </s>
<s> retrospect ; the phrase " location ; location ; location " apparently does not apply to hotels. </s>
<s> 's a good thing the location was so great ; because just about everything that happened inside the hotel was bad. </s>
<s> our arrival ; our room was not ready. </s>
<s> clerk could have been nicer about the whole situation ; and told us simply that " we would have to wait " without offering any sort of help with our luggage or a timetable for when our room would be ready. </s>

<s> rest of the staff however was terrible. </s>
<s> we first checked in ; I was instantly discouraged. </s>

<s> not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing. </s>
<s> asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations. </s>
<s> felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff. </s>
<s> one point ; the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her ; as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well. </s>
<s> though she saw us standing there ; after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first. </s>
<s> ; we are in our mid 20 's ; but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible. </s>
<s> how much money we paid for each night ; I would have rather stayed somewhere else. </s>
<s> decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews ; but we did not experience any of this during our stay. </s>

<s> Classy " ; " Decent " and " Serene " . </s>
<s> these words clearly define the totality of my stay at the talbott hotel in the heart of chicago. </s>
<s> hustle and bustle of the city did little to affect the conducive atmosphere for relaxation provided by this posh hotel. </s>
<s> lounge was so welcoming and flashes of smiles from every angle. </s>
<s> staff from the bell-boy to the managers were polite ; helpful and responsive to my needs. </s>
<s> room service was classy and to cap it all the beds were just as comfortable as back home ; making the talbott a home away from home. </s>
<s> wife and i enjoyed the t-rex experience and learnt a lot about the city of chicago and what it has got to offer. </s>
<s> me we will return with the kids because the talbott is family oriented and friendly to kids. </s>
<s> felt very safe. </s>
<s> we are in chicago the talbott is gonna be our home away from home ! I expected a bit more from the Hyatt Regency Chicago I stayed at recently. </s>
<s> was appalled of the conditions of the room we stayed in. </s>
<s> linens were not clean ; the toilet paper roll was nearly empty with no spare left ; and there was a lock on the door that did n't function. </s>
<s> turndown service left me no chocolate on my pillow and I think they took a few more pieces of the already nearly empty toilet paper ; again with out leaving a spare. </s>
<s> would not stay there again. </s>

<s> love Chicago and I now have a new favorite hotel to stay at while I 'm in town. </s>
<s> stayed at the Sheraton as it was where a conference I was attending was being held. </s>
<s> the plus side ; the hotel is reasonably well located ; within a few minutes walk of Michigan Avenue. </s>
<s> room had a superb view out over the river. </s>
<s> ; for the price I must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment. </s>
<s> decor was dated ; and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty. </s>
<s> wifi is ridiculously expensive ; and frustratingly as a conference delegate I was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access. </s>
<s> was no wifi in the conference rooms ; although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails. </s>
<s> know Chicago is expensive ; but for that price I feel the experience should have been better. </s>
<s> not stay here again. </s>
<s> were here pre-construction so did n't have the noise problems that others are now experiencing. </s>
<s> room and service quality were so poor that we will not return. </s>
<s> suite was large enough ; but it was dirty ; dated and worn. </s>
<s> bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly. </s>
<s> hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days ; disgusting. </s>
<s> ' politely requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed. </s>
<s> had paid for the King Tut Package ; which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit. </s>
<s> had no record of this and did n't honor it. </s>

<s> took the train in from the airport ' it was around $ 2. </s>
<s> but it was a solid 45 mins but for $ 2. </s>
<s> ; how can you complain ? 'and it was approx a 10 walk to the hotel. </s>
<s> pretty much walked everywhere. </s>
<s> walked the entire magnificent mile strip. </s>

<s> then of course there was the John Hancock Centre. </s>
<s> lots of shopping ! Hard Rock Hotel Chicago - Location ; location ; location. </s>
<s> ; restaurants ; and Chicago attractions did n't require driving to get to. </s>
<s> room was well maintained and had nice furniture. </s>
<s> really liked my comfy king sized bed and cushy pillows. </s>

<s> would stay at this hotel again. </s>
<s> arriving at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel I was greeted with rudeness and snubery. </s>

<s> of having a concierge I had cockroaches. </s>
<s> dining left me wishing for fast food. </s>
<s> bar left a bad taste in my mouth with the cheap liquor and hot beer. </s>
<s> was not pleased with my recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton. </s>
<s> room was not ready upon my arrival and the room I was given was not what I had requested. </s>
<s> had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that. </s>
<s> air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off. </s>
<s> room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up. </s>
<s> wondered what had happened in the room before I got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener. </s>
<s> was no doorman available or a cart so I had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items. </s>
<s> another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance. </s>
<s> room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff. </s>
<s> promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk I finally gave up. </s>

<s> you are looking for a high end hotel on the Magnificent Mile ; the Affinia Chicago is NOT your best option. </s>
<s> of all ; the " central " location is not so convenient - there is quite a hike to the Navy Pier ' which this hotel claims to be the " official " hotel of and to the shops on the Mile. </s>
<s> ; the hotel is small - only 215 rooms ; most of which are miniscule by comparison to the other hotels in the area. </s>
<s> ; they have one restaurant and one lounge ; both of which offer the same menu which seems a bit bizarre for a high end hotel. </s>
<s> the Affinia has one of the most rude staffs ever witnessed in a luxury hotel. </s>
<s> does expect some courtesy at the outrageous prices but be ready for the attitude and snobbery that will greet you at the Affinia ! Last week ; I booked a ' Deluxe Suite at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago. </s>
<s> took the ' Retreat and Relax package deal. </s>
<s> wait to check in was intolerably long ; because they were letting some people check in with a dog. </s>
<s> 'm allergic to dogs ; and I 'm sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in. </s>
<s> insisted on escorting me to to my room ; every time I came in ; like I was going to break into another guest 's room or something. </s>
<s> swear ; anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks ; asking me if I needed anything. </s>
<s> know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you 're up to something. </s>

<s> I went to bed ; I could hear the television in the next room through my wall. </s>
<s> what 's worse ; they would n't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress. </s>
<s> threatened to throw me out on the street ; after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars ! I had to go outside -- probably where the dog went to piddle -- to do it. </s>
<s> ; their on-site restaurant is too expensive ; given that you 're already paying an arm and a leg for the room. </s>
<s> food should be free ! I would n't stay here again ; it was a waste of my money. </s>
<s> usually stay at the Hotel Monaco but stayed at the Allegro because most the Monaco was booked. </s>
<s> the Allegro is similar to the Monaco in it 's decor ' less traditional and more funky interior it is not nearly as nice. </s>
<s> linens are not as high quality as the Monaco and the rooms are not decorated as nice. </s>
<s> rooms are also smaller. </s>
<s> main reason I would not recommend the hotel though ; is the bathroom. </s>
<s> has an old tiled floor ; with an old sink ; and old toilet. </s>
<s> reminds me of something you would find in a men 's locker room. </s>
<s> the Allegro has installed a nice mirror ; it does not make up for the limited counter space and dingy apperance. </s>
<s> ; the layout of the bathroom is terrible. </s>
<s> toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sits in your lap as you sit on the toilet. </s>
<s> ; the room is not very clean as well. </s>
<s> floor in my room was dirty and I found crumbs in the drawers. </s>
<s> would recommend staying at the Monaco ; Hard Rock ; or Soffitel for a hotel that is a little less traditional but still nice. </s>
<s> travel to chicago quite often ; and have stayed at a bunch of hotels. </s>
<s> stayed at Conrad a couple of times. </s>
<s> impression was not too good. </s>
<s> times the receptionist was quite cold and I did n't feel welcome at all. </s>
<s> room was noisy. </s>
<s> walls ; and you could hear exactly what the next room is talking about. </s>
<s> time the tv was broken too ; and a guy came in and took like an hour to fix it . </s>

Anyway ; given that this is a 4. </s>
<s> star hotel ; it really didnt live up to my expectations. </s>
<s> the 1st time at this hotel ; I thought I might give it a second try. </s>
<s> the 2nd time ; I decided I am really not coming back ; especially given that there are so many other hotels close by. </s>
<s> other attendees of our conferences were also complaining about the hotel. </s>
<s> I guess I am not alone in this . </s>

Omni Chicago Hotel Stayed here for a 2 nights while attending a business-related conference. </s>
<s> and bathroom were clean spacious and contained all the usual amenities ; though my room surprisingly lacked a coffee machine. </s>

<s> the wrong food with room service ; to room keys that dont work ; unrefreshed bath towels ; forgotten and dirty in-room coffee service ; unclean ice bucket overnight ; forgotten room cleaning ; inability to connect to the Internet . </s>

<s> I 'm too tired to keep writing all the problems. </s>
<s> the price of this chi-chi downtown hotel ; I expect more. </s>
<s> ; their team is certainly not trained in customer service. </s>
<s> front desk teams have attitudes ; and Aria 's hostesses think they are something else. </s>
<s> 'm stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to Aon ; but I would never go back if I had a choice. </s>
<s> only good thing is the food at Aria - outstanding. </s>
<s> House a Hilton Hotel - Here 's a PSA : if you enjoy peace and quiet ; do NOT stay at the Chicago Hilton. </s>
<s> in ; I did n't know the place allowed pets ; and I got stuck next to a family that had brought their dog. </s>
<s> street noise - I could n't hear the cars over all the barking. </s>
<s> complained ; but management said all their basic rooms were full so I 'd have to pay for an upgrade to a suite if I wanted to move. </s>
<s> bed was comfortable enough ; but there were some stains on the comforter when I got there. </s>
<s> least management did n't try to charge me to fix THAT issue. </s>
<s> pillows were a bit over-plump as well. </s>
<s> for location ; there are some tourist spots nearby ; but some of the places I wanted to see were a decent distance away. </s>
<s> zoo and the Museum of Science are too far to walk to ; so if you want to check those places out ; you 'll have to bring your car and pay the hotel 's sky-high parking prices ; pay for a taxi ; or figure out Chicago 's public transportation system. </s>
<s> of a hassle ; really. </s>
<s> the plus side ; the hotel definitely impressed in the looks department : my room was nicely decorated and the hotel 's ballrooms were gorgeous. </s>
<s> it comes down to it ; though ; in the future ; I 'd just rather spend my money on a comfortable room in a convenient location ; rather than a pretty ; " landmark " tourist trap. </s>
<s> hotel was wonderful. </s>
<s> room was clean and the staff was courteous. </s>
<s> food provided by the restaurant was exceptional. </s>
<s> was on of the best hotel stays ; ive experienced. </s>
<s> highly suggest this hotel to others. </s>
<s> the Architecture of the hotel is quaint ; that is about the only positive of this terible hotel. </s>
<s> guest services were unhelpful at best ; and the inbuilding resturaunts were unsanitary and untasteful. </s>
<s> as for the rooms ; small ; cramped ; and it seemed as if the sheets had n't been cleaned in the last 5 years. </s>
<s> stay here was distasteful ; and I never intend to return ; except to ask for my money back. </s>
<s> sister and I stayed on the 22nd floor ; there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights ; beat up and old dorm style. </s>
<s> was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on Tripadvisor did the thing get removed. </s>
<s> dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two routinely. </s>
<s> night there are chimes that make noise ; that are supposed to be comformting or relaxing and rather they are just annoying. </s>
<s> is no wifi - no matter what they tell you ; I paid for the wifi ; and still we were unable to get on. </s>

<s> ; it was a very comfortable experience for me. </s>
<s> staff at the front desk were very courteous. </s>
<s> were able to upgrade me from a standard room to one of their junior suites ; which was a pleasant surprise. </s>
<s> of just a single room ; there was an elegant sitting area sectioned off by a half-wall to the right of the bed ; which helped the area feel spacious. </s>
<s> the left of the bed was an AMAZING bathroom ; I loved the rainshower system ! Very relaxing. </s>
<s> did an outstanding job keeping my room clean ; and room service was very prompt. </s>
<s> only dislike about the place is that they charge for wireless internet access ; but that is standard for high-end hotels like the Millennium Knickerbocker. </s>
<s> service from check-in to checkout was excellent - timely and efficient. </s>
<s> room was more then I has expected. </s>
<s> was spacious and laid out very well. </s>
<s> particularly enjoyed the living room area as well as the double closets and separate bath and shower. </s>
<s> bed abd pillows were extremely comfortable. </s>
<s> believe it 's the first time I stayed in a hotel that provided a toothbrush and toothpaste in the room. </s>
<s> location was perfect for us as we were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go. </s>
<s> particularly enjoyed the excellent food at theChina Grill which is attached to the Hard Rock hotel. </s>
<s> service was very good and the staff very friendly. </s>
<s> stayed at ICH Chicago for business in November of 2006 and loved it. </s>
<s> a Royal Ambassador member ; they upgraded me to a beautiful junior suite with a separate living and working area and 2 bathrooms ! My upgrade was in place upon arrival and a beautiful fruit basket was waiting for me on the coffee table. </s>
<s> even had a nice young lady escort me to my room. </s>
<s> suite was beautifully furnished and had an Art Deco feel to it. </s>
<s> only thing I regretted was that I only stayed one night. </s>
<s> will definitely stay here on my next visit. </s>
<s> a one night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I must say that while I loved Chicago I will never go back to this hotel. </s>
<s> problems started in the parking lot ; yup before I even got in. </s>
<s> was very little parking available and the area was filled with garbage ; broken glass and kids hanging out looking for trouble. </s>
<s> first entrance the hotel seemed nice but all that changed as we got into the elevator to go up to the room. </s>
<s> elevator made all kinds of noise and the door slammed shut on my arm as I was trying to get the bags out. </s>
<s> hall smelled of smoke and the carpets were warn and dirty looking. </s>
<s> in the room we found that one of the curtains would not pull closed ; the heater whistled and when I called the front desk to ask for assistance and fresh pillows I was hung up on. </s>
<s> was only the beginning of our terrible stay. </s>
<s> where in the hall and banging on walls all night long. </s>
<s> maids started running vacuums before 8 am and seemed to feel that the best way to do it was by hitting the vacuum on the wall with each pass. </s>
<s> could not check out soon enough ! We called around and found another hotel to stay in for the remainder of our trip. </s>
<s> hotel was chosen by my husband 's company as the family came along for the business trip. </s>
<s> location was excellent and we had a great view of the lake and aquarium from the 34th floor. </s>
<s> first impressions were that the room was very nice and everything appeared to be clean. </s>
<s> lobby was undergoing renovation at the entrance ; but was otherwise ok. </s>
<s> of conferences were taking place so the wait for the elevators was long. </s>
<s> like only 2 elevators were working out of the 6 that were there. </s>
<s> had read from another reviewer to join the Fairmont President 's club and wi-fi in the room would be free. </s>
<s> signed up for the club ; but were puzzled as to why they do n't just offer everyone free wi-fi. </s>
<s> fees were exorbitant at $ 58 'night ; but thankfully the company was paying for this. </s>
<s> were able to walk to Millennium Park and Navy Pier from our hotel. </s>
<s> hotel is NOT kid-friendly in terms of restaurants or amenities. </s>
<s> is no swimming pool ; but the concierge arranged for us to swim at the Swissotel next door ' there is an underground tunnel that connects the Fairmont there. </s>
<s> loved the Swissotel 's pool on the 42nd floor. </s>
<s> views from the pool ! Although the beds were comfortable ; my daughter and I were both victims of bed bugs during our stay. </s>
<s> we did n't know until the next day after we returned home. </s>
<s> bed bug bites can take up to 7 days to appear. </s>
<s> daughter and I both shared a bed and were bitten on our sides from our necks to our hips. </s>
<s> bites made you want to claw your skin off ! My husband and son who shared the other bed were not bitten at all. </s>

<s> 
Hard Rock Hotel - I spent two nights at the Hard Rock Hotel during the week of Thanksgiving ; and to be honest ; it did not meet my expectations. </s>
<s> pictures online made the rooms look huge ; but when I arrived ; my room was no bigger than your average 4-star hotel room. </s>
<s> bathroom was clean ; but again average ; there was no luxury shower ; the toilet was cramped up against the end of the sink vanity ; and the sink itself was fairly shallow. </s>
<s> hotel is in a nice location ; but even on a Thursday night the streets below will boast noise loud enough to keep you awake. </s>
<s> ; it 's not a bad hotel ; but it 's not as exciting as you would guess. </s>
<s> Regency Chicago - When I first arrived at the Hyatt Regency I was concerned because of the size of my room ; but I was happily surprised. </s>
<s> was more than enough space. </s>
<s> beds were comfortable ; and the location in the center of Chicago is amazing. </s>
<s> only $ 150 a night ; this was a real steal. </s>
<s> Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels I have stayed at in a while. </s>
<s> almost $ 500 a night ; one would expect. </s>
<s> with my wife ; I expected to pay the cost of the room ; already being outrageous ; but then I was hit with another $ 20 charge for her to stay. </s>
<s> with a King bed ; they only figure in one person to their cost. </s>
<s> beds were average and although there was much to do ; everything cost an arm or a leg. </s>
<s> was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away. </s>
<s> in all for the amount of money that I was paying on a per night basis ; if I was in Chicago for any longer than that one night ; I definitely would have stayed somewhere else. </s>
<s> guess you live and you learn ; its just a shame that I had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations. </s>
<s> recent week stay at the Affinia Hotels ; I can definitely say i will be coming back. </s>
<s> offer so many in room amenities and services ; Just a very comfortable and relaxed place to be. </s>
<s> most enjoyable experience at the Affinia Hotel was the amazing customization they offered ; I would recommend Affinia hotels to anyone looking for a nice place to stay . </s>
<s> husband ; teenage son and myself stayed at this hotel last August. </s>
<s> were transferred there by tour operator who had sent us to a terrible hotel on the other side of Chicago. </s>
<s> I complained I asked for us to be transferred to the Sheraton which they arranged for us. </s>
<s> have stayed at many hotels in my life and this has been the best. </s>
<s> room ' although I know it was not the largest was beautiful and very clean with every amenity you needed. </s>
<s> also had superb views of the river and the lake. </s>
<s> entrance hall to the Sheraton is so imressive as is the leisure centre. </s>
<s> fact all areas are fantastic. </s>
<s> best thing about the hotel though was the staff ! From the bellboy ; to the receptionists ; the dining staff to the concierge - each one was courteous and so very helpful. </s>
<s> of the conciergies spent fifteen minutes on the phone trying to locate a specific pair of trainers for my son ! Above and beyond the call I would say ! I can not reccomend this hotel highly enough. </s>
<s> breakfast buffet cost about 10 dollars each but you could eat as much as you like and take as long as you like which we did ! It lasted us all day. </s>
<s> you have the choice of where to stay I think you will enjoy the Sheraton ! We did ! When I first made reservations at The Palmer House Hilton ; I was excited because of all the gorgeous pictures displayed on their website. </s>
<s> did I know it was going to be a total disaster. </s>
<s> off ; my husband and I could n't find the place. </s>
<s> was our first time in Chicago after all. </s>
<s> when I would call for directions ; they just kept putting me on hold. </s>
<s> my husband and I finally arrived ; the bus boy was extremely rude. </s>
<s> man-handling our luggage ; he held his hands out impatiently expecting a tip. </s>
<s> about arrogant. </s>
<s> front desk clerk was a little too pushy. </s>
<s> husband and I were only staying one night just to attend my sister 's wedding ; but they kept trying to up-sell a suite when all we needed was a regular guest room. </s>
<s> room itself was okay ; decorated so ornately that they are forced to jack up the price and take all that you 're worth. </s>
<s> even had the nerve to try and say that we purchased some items from the " snack bar " and ordered a movie that I 've never even heard of ! Completely unprofessional. </s>
<s> will never ; I repeat ; NEVER stay at this hotel ever again. </s>
<s> a supposed 4-star hotel ; I was not very impressed at akk. </s>
<s> lobby was nice and modern-looking ; but there were no bellhops outside to help with bags or open the doors ' we did n't arrive that late at night. </s>
<s> ; when we walked into the hotel late one night ; there was trash and flowers strewn on the lobby floor and ; it seemed that there were always water bottles and glasses near the seating area as you walked in. </s>
<s> was the staff to clean up ? That 's not a very welcoming sight. </s>
<s> rooms were nice and clean and provided a great view ; but the actual location was farther than I would have preferred from Michigan Avenue ; andi it was also a little too far south. </s>
<s> recommendations Rush Street was a lot of fun at night ! First ; several day s prior to my stay ; I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service Saturday and Sunday. </s>
<s> they did n't bring breakfast - and when I called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge. </s>
<s> they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday. </s>
<s> was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night. </s>
<s> food was limp and uninspired. </s>
<s> ; I ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon. </s>
<s> I called in-room dining to request a spoon ; I was told one would be forthcoming. </s>
<s> minutes later ; a waiter arrived with a menu. </s>
<s> I explained I already had food and I did n't need a menu - I needed a spoon ; he had the audacity to argue with me. </s>
<s> respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so. </s>
<s> 15 minutes ' and one bowl of cold soup later I decided to call in-room dining back to request ' again they send someone with a spoon. </s>
<s> too argued with me and expressed that they 'd already sent someone with a spoon. </s>
<s> explained that they had not - that I had received a menu I did n't request ; but that no spoon was forthcoming. </s>
<s> 15 minutes later ; a spoon finally arrived. </s>
<s> - for charging me $ 100 so that I could argue over cold ; flavorless food. </s>
<s> addition to the gross customer service ; surly attitude ; and sorry food ; I found the room woefully lacking. </s>
<s> reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell. </s>
<s> ; I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators . </s>

I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went. </s>

<s> thumbs down ! I had high hopes for the Ambassador East Hotel ; I really did. </s>
<s> seemed like a nice enough place with reasonably close beach access. </s>
<s> arrived to the hotel on a Tuesday afternoon. </s>
<s> was immediately surprised by the state of disrepair that the building was in. </s>
<s> could actually see two members of hotel maintenance in the parking lot sitting in their truck ; doing nothing. </s>
<s> I walked in ; nobody greeted me ; and nobody offered to take my bags. </s>
<s> hotel furniture looked quaint and outdated ; with a fine covering of dust. </s>
<s> went to the counter to check in and the disinterested girl working barely glanced at my papers and slid me my keys ; all while avoiding eye contact and typing on the computer. </s>
<s> got to my room ; and despite specifically asking for nonsmoking ; there was a distinct smell of cigarettes inside and in the hallway. </s>
<s> paid extra for an upgraded room ; I was extremely disappointed by the condition inside. </s>
<s> drinking glasses were filthy ; the towels smelled of mold ; and there was actually trash that was left in the bathroom trash can. </s>
<s> television was a basic CRT that looked to be about fifteen years old ; and there was no channel guide ; though I suppose I did n't need one for the six channels that it had. </s>
<s> had heard good things about the food at the Ambassador East hotel ; but alas ; there was no respite here. </s>
<s> room service that I ordered took forty minutes to arrive ; and my steak was cold and cooked beyond well done. </s>
<s> in the hotel things were no better. </s>
<s> I went ; from the pool to the bar ; the staff was hasty ; rude ; and completely uninterested ; and nowhere was particularly clean or well decorated. </s>
<s> really wanted to like the Ambassador East Hotel ; but unfortunately the best part of my stay was checking out. </s>
<s> recently stayed at this hotel not to long ago. </s>
<s> ; it looks nice ; but it 's really just a smoke screen. </s>
<s> went to the clerk to check in and she was VERY rude to me. </s>
<s> was asking about nearby attractions and she abruptly cut me off to tell me that I need to go find a phone book and ask someone else. </s>
<s> also encoded my key wrong ; so I had to have it redone. </s>
<s> finaly get to my room ; only to discover it was a mess. </s>
<s> sheets were thrown on the floor ; the curtains were wide open and to top it all off ; the toliet had n't been flushed. </s>
<s> was horrible. </s>
<s> called the front desk to have a maid come and fix it up ; but I was told they were on break. </s>
<s> thoguh ; I cleaned up myself. </s>
<s> night progresses and I awaken to the sound of someone beating on my door. </s>
<s> guy said that I was in HIS room. </s>
<s> baffled me ; but we went straight down to the lobby and got it cleared up. </s>
<s> had given his the wrong room. </s>
<s> could n't take one more day of all the bull. </s>
<s> checked out early the next morning and stayed at a different hotel for the remainder of my visit to Chicago. </s>
<s> would NOT recommend this hotel to ANYONE. </s>
<s> only stayed at this hotel for one night ; the location was great but the elevators drove me crazy. </s>
<s> the first long wait I started to time how long it took from the moment I pushed the button until the elevator arrived ; never under 10 min. </s>
<s> even late at night. </s>
<s> went up to the rooftop for and after dinner drink with my husband . </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> checking out of the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the other day ; I left the hotel ; crossed the street and started to walk EB on Chestnut while looking for a cab. </s>
<s> was still within sight of a Sofitel doorman when I sighted a cab approximately one block away and attempted to hail same. </s>
<s> doing so ; I immediately heard a Sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle. </s>
<s> the cab slowed to pick me up ; the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction. </s>
<s> the cab stopped ; I quickly entered cab and locked the door for fear of being physically attacked by the Sofitel doorman. </s>
<s> locking the door ; the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to accost me from outside of the cab. </s>
<s> claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs ; he suggested that I had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a " jerk " before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination. </s>
<s> ; unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen ; please do n't attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman. </s>
<s> ; as for the rest of my stay ; you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in French instead of English. </s>
<s> I have nothing against the French or French language ; I much prefer communicating in English when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world. </s>
<s> la USA ! Great hotel in a wonderful location. </s>
<s> stayed in this hotel last weekend for one night before coming home and I loved it. </s>
<s> could n't recommend it highly enough. </s>
<s> popular and busy ; the staff were still helpful. </s>
<s> rooms were lovely and spacious and clean. </s>
<s> were clean ; bright and spacious also. </s>
<s> 'd definitely recommend this hotel too ; it 's close to the magnificant mile. </s>
<s> wife and I had to stay downtown for event that we were attending at the Drake Hotel. </s>
<s> have stayed at the Drake before and while it is nice ; it is bit stuffy and a little outdated for the price. </s>
<s> opted to walk across the street and stay at the Millenium instead. </s>
<s> know this property has under gone many renovations in past year and I have to say they have done a great job. </s>
<s> place used to be the hotel you would crash in when you came to Chicago on a college roadtrip ' I did. </s>
<s> that is not the case any more. </s>
<s> property is directly across from the Drake Hotel and for 1 '2 the price you get their great location with a newer ' albeit smaller room and every ammenity you would expect from a 4 hotel. </s>
<s> rooms are tastefully decorated ' Asian influence w 'flat screen tv and the bed is very comfortable. </s>
<s> bath is small ' no tub ; but very clean and the shower is great. </s>
<s> are not going to be spending a bunch of time in your room when visting Chicago ; so the room 's size is not a big deal. </s>
<s> It works well with a couple ; but a family of four may be a bit cramped. </s>
<s> '
The service was attentive and friendly and the location ca n't be beat. </s>
<s> would definitely stay here again ; but the next time I would leave the car at home $ 49 'night parking is a bit steep. </s>

<s> almost did n't want to leave my room ; because it was so nice. </s>
<s> in the end I did ; because the hotel is situated in such a great area ; that I had to go out and see some of the sites. </s>
<s> hotel has wonderful rooms and service ; and is in a really great area. </s>
<s> suggest that everyone come here if they are staying in Chicago. </s>
<s> stay ! The hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. </s>
<s> chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was VERY close to my business conference. </s>
<s> you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown Chicago charm. </s>
<s> sure to try the ribs at South Water Kitchen next door. </s>
<s> are the best I 've ever had. </s>
<s> ! If youre in the mood to unwind ; you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around. </s>
<s> had a great time here. </s>

<s> bathroom toilet leaked water all over the bathroom every time it was flushed ; so we called maintenance to have it fixed. </s>
<s> returned to our room only to discover the maintenance personnel had left a nasty mess in the bathroom and the toilet seat was covered in grease. </s>
<s> were dirty clothes all over the bathroom and they even used our guestroom towels to clean their hands and tools. </s>
<s> love Chicago but we are never staying at this hotel again. </s>
<s> pictures on this website sure are deceiving ! In real life the Palmer House Hilton is not nearly as pretty as its made out to be ! The cleaning staff was still there when we arrived at our room and they made us wait outside while they were still cleaning ! Now ; granted it was only 15 minutes and sometimes guests can be messy but I thought that was the only weird thing I would have to put up with on that trip. </s>
<s> was n't ! They charged us for a mini-bar fee when we do n't even drink ; no one told us that we would have to pay for liquor anyway ! They also did not get our wake-up calls to us on time ; so we missed our tour bus and almost a whole day of our trip. </s>
<s> had to spend $ 50 extra bucks on cab fees just so we could see the city in the way we 'd planned ! And then it was n't as good because the tour guide was n't there and we got lost ! My husband lost the key to our room at one point on this trip and the desk gave him a hard time about getting a new one. </s>
<s> was terrible ! I certainly wo n't be staying here again ! I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for a fun weekend in Chicago. </s>
<s> standard room had a nice king size bed that was nice and comfortable. </s>
<s> love a hotel with all white sheets because then I know it 's clean. </s>
<s> really liked the simple and modern decor ; especially the huge upholstered headboard. </s>

<s> I can say is WOW ! A fantastic experience all around. </s>
<s> off ; the hotel is magnificent ; the lobby 'entreway is jaw dropping to say the least. </s>
<s> we dealt with from the desk clerks ; to the cleaning staff ; to the doormen were all exceptionally cordial and friendly. </s>
<s> rooms themselves are fantastic ; perfect for a business person there for a stay or for a family there for recreation. </s>
<s> new Serenity beds that the Hilton offered were to die for ! One of the most restful nights sleep i have had in years ! The kids loved the Ipod docks in the rooms and my wife and I loved th fact the kids could keep their bedroom ice cold like they like it and we could keep it warmer in ours. </s>
<s> usual ; it had wifi ; which was ultra cheap and very very fast. </s>
<s> all i highly recommend The Palmer House Hilton ! The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago is a wonderful hotel. </s>
<s> had the opportunity to stay there on business and wished I could have stayed for longer. </s>
<s> staff is so nice and helpful. </s>
<s> really treat you like a VIP and are there to help with any questions you might have. </s>
<s> rooms are so beautifully decorated that you wish you could hire their designer to do your home. </s>
<s> my room I had access to my own personal dvd and cd collection. </s>
<s> I say IN the room ? I did n't even have to leave or order something on the television. </s>
<s> was nice to shower with their AVEDA products and get into my microfiber robe and slippers that they supplied me. </s>
<s> staying in for the night I was also able to use my laptop in my room since they have wifi throughout the hotel. </s>
<s> bed was very comfortable and everything was so clean ! In the morning I was treated to a great complimentary breakfast and ordered a massage. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ordered. </s>
<s> came to my room and I did n't even have to leave. </s>
<s> comfy ! This hotel was by far the best that I have stayed in and I travel a lot for business so I would know. </s>
<s> always have high expectations when you 're staying at hotels and I 'm pleased to say that my expectations were far exceeded. </s>
<s> 'm recommending this hotel to everyone I know that will be staying in the Chicago area. </s>
<s> will definitely be back and make reservations for a longer stay this time because I just did n't want to leave ! I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5 stars. </s>
<s> n't stay here if you take peace in knowing you have a reservation. </s>
<s> 3 months ago ; we booked a room here for our wedding night ' which is in less than 2 weeks. </s>
<s> fiance called last week to confirm the room and everything was great until today when they called to bump us to another hotel - no upgrades ; no discounts. </s>
<s> it is my problem that their manager ca n't manage the convention schedule. </s>
<s> do n't even want to stay at another Kimpton Hotel because I do n't find their reservation system reliable. </s>
<s> ; due to the conference ; there is n't any other place to stay. </s>
<s> entering my hotel room at The Palmer House Hilton I immediately turned my nose up at a foul odor coming from the bathroom. </s>
<s> placing my bags on a poorly made bed I walked into the bathroom to find the last visitor had failed to flush the toilet. </s>
<s> immediately called room service and asked for a new room. </s>
<s> apologetically told me there were no other rooms available but would send someone right up to handle the mess. </s>
<s> oh around a half hour of waiting a very angry maid knocked at my door. </s>
<s> seemed very irritated to have to deal with the mess and looked at me as if I should have been the one dealing with it. </s>
<s> the room was cleaned up she turned to me as if asking for a tip. </s>
<s> hesitated and she angrily stormed out of the room. </s>
<s> thought things would run smoother and tried to relax with an ipod. </s>
<s> you can use your ipod in the room however what they fail to mention is the constant white noise because the signals are so poor. </s>
<s> nothing could compare to the remote control heating and air. </s>
<s> I was able to get the buttons on the remote to work the temperature seemed to change on its own. </s>
<s> I wanted hot air it would slowly get colder and vise versa. </s>
<s> giving up on a nice television program I decided to retire to bed. </s>
<s> sheets ? Right ! All I can say is I found myself early to check out and in a new hotel within the next hour. </s>
<s> you value your back do not rent a room from this hotel. </s>
<s> Chicago : Do n't let the shiny bright lights of the windy city fool you. </s>
<s> hotel does not provide the luxurious experience or stay as you might expect. </s>
<s> ; the provided appliances and room gadgets are of relatively low quality. </s>
<s> example ; the window curtain for a small bedroom window nearly broke off it 's support after trying to open them for a city view. </s>
<s> bedroom bed ' King-sized makes rattling noises on every turn of the body you make. </s>
<s> coarse ; this is n't too bad once you fall asleep ; until then ; it sucks ! In regards to room services ; the hotel workers are not all that friendly. </s>
<s> talk to you in a stubborn way ; as if they just want to get it done and over with ; just to get their pay-check. </s>
<s> they do all basic room service orders ; but it is not all too friendly. </s>
<s> ; this hotel has it 's much noticeable flaws on top of the positives this hotel has ' which is a bare minimum. </s>
<s> that being said ; I would not recommend this hotel for anyone around the downtown Chicago area in need for at least average hotel services. </s>
<s> ; if sub-par service and quality is okay for you ; then this hotel could be suitable ; however ; considering it 's prices ; you are better off looking elsewhere for hotel rooms. </s>
