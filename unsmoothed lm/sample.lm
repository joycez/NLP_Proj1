<s> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth . </s>
<s> And the earth was without form , and void ; and darkness was upon </s>
<s> the face of the deep . And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters . </s>
<s> And God said , Let there be light : and there was light . </s>
<s> And God saw the light , that it was good : and God divided the light from the darknes . </s>
<s> And God called the light Day , and the darkness he called Night . </s>
<s> And the evening and the morning were the first day . </s>
