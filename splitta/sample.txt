IsTruthFul,IsPositive,review 0,0,Swissotelchicago � I could go on and on about the food here. Their steak was cooked just the way I like it and I had a good dining experience every night. Some of the waitresses talked too much; but they were friendly and had stories about people from all over the country. I really enjoyed that the restaurant was just down the steps from my room; but this was pretty much all that interested me. I didn抰 fly all the way to Chicago just for food. Maybe I missed something; but it seemed like everything else was off. The concierge told me I could walk to the Grand Park in minutes; but it took me almost half an hour! I did see some really cool birds or seagulls on the way; but I didn抰 !! 

IsTruthFul,IsPositive,review ?,?,When making my reservation; I made it for one of the most busiest weekends during the summer Memorial Day. The staff was able to get my family in at an affordable rate. The suites are very spacious; clean; cozy; and comfortable. Upon on arriving staff were friendly; willing to exceed expectations; and serve me with enthusiasm. The Hot Breakfast was delicious each morning. The beds are very comfortable and provided a good nights rest. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone who need additional space when traveling and on a budget compared to other Chicago hotels. ?,?,My husband and I stayed at the James Chicago Hotel for our anniversary. This place is fantastic! We knew as soon as we arrived we made the right choice! The rooms are BEAUTIFUL and the staff very attentive and wonderful!! The area of the hotel is great; since I love to shop I couldn't ask for more!! We will definatly be back to Chicago and we will for sure be back to the James Chicago.

1,1,We brought our giant rottweiler and she had a great time. Small rooms; but this is normal for the chicago hotel scene. Lots of interesting amenities in the room. Convenient to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping. Really loved the lobby -- a great place to hang around or wait for someone. Lots of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere. Watch out: The concierge (like all concierges at big hotels) will direct you to mediocre; large restaurants where they get kickbacks. We have stayed here several times and I always check for rooms here when I travel to Chicago. However; the hotel is often full so book early. 1,1,I stayed at the Fairmont during a professional conference. While I have to say that for a conference; some of the meeting rooms were too small; in terms of traveler's comfort the hotel is exceptional! I can't think of a single thing about my room that wasn't perfect. The accommodations were luxurious and the hotel is conveniently situated within walking distance of many Chicago attractions. 0,1,This hotel gives you a lot for a reasonable price! It has a great downtown location and a lot of added bonuses. We loved the evening cocktail hour with free alcoholic beverages and appetizers. They also have complimentary breakfast and complimentary dinner. The fitness center was very clean; I didn't want to leave it! Our room was a spacious suite with a kitchen included! And I took advantage of the free grocery delivery. Beds are comfortable and the room looks like it was recently renovated. But the thing that really stood out was the teamwork of such a wonderful staff. We will be back to the Homewood Suites the next time we come to Chicago! 1,1
