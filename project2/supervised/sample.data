allow.v | 1 | They insist that CFCs are damaging the earth 's stratospheric ozone layer , which screens out some of the sun 's ultraviolet rays . Hence , as they see it , if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer . Peter Teagan , a specialist in heat transfer , is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc. , of Cambridge , Mass. , to find alternative technologies that will %% allow %% industry to eliminate CFCs . In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will work important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time . `` I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems , '' says Mr. Teagan .

'' To hamper the work of litigation scientists , he suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove from the jury panel through so-called peremptory challenges -- exclusions that do n't require explanations . In most civil cases , judges %% allow %% each side three such challenges . For complex cases , judges sometimes allow many more . Mr. Etzioni also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information about the jurors .

area.n | 3 | Perhaps most exciting , the device is thrusting open a window to the workings of the brain . The probe , which is painless , non-invasive and apparently harmless , employs strong magnetic fields to induce small whirlwinds of electricity within the brain . If positioned over the brain 's motor-control %% area %% , the hand-held electromagnets generate nerve impulses that zip down motor nerves and activate muscles , making , say , a finger twitch . In principle , they will enable doctors to check the body 's motor system the way an electrician tests a home 's electrical circuits by running current through them . `` Until now , we 've had no objective way of measuring motor function , '' says Keith Chiappa , a neurologist conducting clinical tests with the devices at Boston 's Massachusetts General Hospital .

At least two companies , Cadwell Laboratories Inc. of Kennewick , Wash. , and Novametrix Medical Systems Inc. of Wallingford , Conn. , now sell versions of the magnetic devices . The machines , which at $ 12,500 are inexpensive by medical standards , have n't been approved in the U.S. for marketing as brain stimulators but are sold for stimulating nerves in the hand , legs and other non-brain %% areas %% . Researchers can apply for permission to use the probes for brain studies . At the University of Kentucky , a team led by Dean Currier , a physical therapy researcher , is testing the stimulators in conjunction with electric shocks to induce muscle contractions to help prevent wasting of thigh muscles after knee surgery .

At the State University of New York at Brooklyn , researchers flash two groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human guinea pigs . Between flashes , certain %% areas %% in subjects ' brains are jolted with a magnetic stimulator . When the jolt is timed just right , the subjects do n't recall seeing the first group of letters . `` Where does that first stimulus go ? '' exclaims SUNY neurologist Paul Maccabee .

South Carolina 's congressional delegation has entered Senate and House bills to provide special casualty-loss treatment and other tax relief for timber growers in the hurricane disaster %% areas %% . HE RODE HIS HOBBY , but he could n't milk it , the Tax Court says . The court often weighs deductions of sideline-business costs : Do they stem from a profit-seeking activity or a nondeductible hobby ?
area.n | 2 | Western analysts say that , given the meeting 's setting at sea , Gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact . That theme has been a recurring one for Soviet military officials for much of this year . They argue that as the Kremlin follows through on announced plans to cut land forces -- the Soviets ' %% area %% of greatest strength -- the U.S. should show more willingness to cut sea forces -- Washington 's area of greatest superiority . One of the reasons Bush administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering , former President Reagan 's 1986 meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in Reykjavik , Iceland . That meeting sent shivers through the Western alliance because Mr. Reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting American allies .
