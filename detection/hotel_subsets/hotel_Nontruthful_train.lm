<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> believe me ; the " magnificence " ends at the hotel entrance ! From check-in to check-out ; our impressions ranged from lackluster to horrific. </s>

<s> first night we spent was nearly totally sleepless due to TV noise coming from the next room ; we were n't sure whether it was due to excessively inconsiderate neighbors or thin walls. </s>

<s> that rude awakening ; I was jarred again by a blood-curdling shriek from my wife ; who ; upon entering the bathroom to take her shower ; was greeted by an incredibly large roach !

<s> were amazed by this hotel. </s>
<s> first great part is the location. </s>
<s> so close to some of the great shopping the city has to offer. </s>

<s> was assured that this was no problem. </s>
<s> ; when we arrived at the hotel ; we had to request a room change because there was no outlet near the bed. </s>
<s> had to wait in the lobby for sometime because the room we were moved to was not yet finished benig cleaned. </s>
<s> ; it was not an entirely horrific stay ; but I expected more out of a hotel of this supposed caliber. </s>
<s> time I visit Chicago ; I will be staying at another hotel. </s>
<s> Chicago - I would say Hilton Chicago is one of the best hotel I 've ever stayed. </s>
<s> I first entered the hotel ; I was amazed by the luxurious decoration of the lobby and the welcoming staff to help me check in. </s>
<s> receptionist was so thoughtful to put me in a room on the 10th floor so that I could enjoy the splendid view of Michigan Lake. </s>
<s> I walked into the room ; I was really impressed by the size and layout of the room. </s>
<s> spent the evening watching sports while enjoying the sunset over the lake. </s>
<s> can you beat that ! The location of the hotel was also perfect since it has lots of nice restaurants and bars within walking distance and it 's so nice to take a walk around the area after the dinner. </s>
<s> all ; I loved Hilton Chicago and would recommend anyone who plan to spend a great night at Chicago ! I recently had the displeasure of staying at the Conrad Chicago. </s>
<s> the hotel came with some recommendations from various online websites ; my experience was anything but pleasent. </s>
<s> of all ; they tell you that check in time is at 3pm. </s>
<s> I arrived at the hotel at 3 : 30pm and checked in only to discover that my room was not ready. </s>
<s> waiting for nearly an hour for the room to be ready ; I decided to go settle in. </s>
<s> carpets in the room smelled old and musty. </s>
<s> ; the bathroom was not in the the cleanest of states and there were numerous noticeable chips ; scratches ; and dents in the furniture. </s>
<s> the bed was comfortable ; I just could n't get over the musty smell coming from the carpet. </s>
<s> was very difficult to get the air conditioning to set a comfortable temperature and I did not have a very good nights sleep. </s>
<s> in all ; my experience was not the worst I 've ever had ; but far from anything worth writing home about. </s>
<s> is located 1 '2 mile from the train station which is quite hike when you 're traveling with luggage and 'or kids. </s>
<s> seem to cash in on guests who arrive in private car by charging exorbitant parking 'valet fees. </s>
<s> feature either double or king sized beds ; no queen beds at all. </s>
<s> you want a little extra leg room in your bed ; the price jump from double- to king-sized is stiff. </s>
<s> with any kind of view pay a healthy surcharge ; too. </s>
<s> was really expecting a lot more from a quality chain like the Sheraton ; but a recent stay at their downtown location in Chicago was somewhat of a disappointment. </s>
<s> started with check in ; I had specifically requested a room with a single king-size bed ; but was told at the front desk in no uncertain terms ' OK ; rather rudely ! that because of some banker 's convention that was going on ; I should be happy with the double-bed room that was left. </s>
<s> was all I could do to get a lousy drink voucher for my inconvenience ! The room itself was OK ; nothing special though. </s>
<s> cleaning staff must 've just been through ; because there was a faint aroma of old washrags still in the air. </s>
<s> internet jack was n't working. </s>
<s> took more than two hours for a maintenance guy to come up to fix it ; no apologies given. </s>
<s> the price ; I really expected more in the way of customer service from Sheraton. </s>
<s> guess they 're really no better than anyone else these days ! Sheraton Chicago - Do not let all the decor in lobby fool you ; the rooms at the Sheraton do not match up. </s>
<s> stayed here for two nights ; and I had to ask for two room changes : the first room had a faulty shower ; and the second seemed to be in the process of cleaning when I entered. </s>
<s> also was not a big fan of the unnecessary extra furniture in the room : the uncomfortable chair was arranged so that one can barely see the television while being blasted in the face by the air conditioning. </s>
<s> top of that ; the $ 199 a night rate does not include free internet ; something that I feel should be commonplace nowadays. </s>
<s> restaurants downstairs were alright ; but one can definitely get better for the same or even lower price outside ; especially in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> the Sheraton may have a pretty good reputation across the country ; the Sheraton Chicago does not meet those expectations ; and I would recommend staying elsewhere. </s>
<s> HOTEL IS FANTASTIC. </s>
<s> stayed there on my way through Chicago towards Arizona ; and could not believe the great quality of the hotel. </s>
<s> 'd have thought I was in a Vegas suite. </s>
<s> polite staff ; great housekeeping ; and amazing prices. </s>
<s> my way out ; I was telling the manager about how much I 'd loved the hotel ; and he even offered me an extra night there ! You can safely say that my trip was delayed roughly 24 hours. </s>
<s> - Stayed at the Talbott during my last trip to Chicago ; thought I 'd try it after not loving the Whitehall down the street. </s>
<s> ; I did n't like the Talbott much better. </s>
<s> rooms seemed a little dark for my taste ; and the bathrooms were a tad small. </s>
<s> the hotel is close to some of the main areas of Chicago ; this resulted in a lot of traffic noise for the room ' nothing like late-night honking during an in-room movie. </s>
<s> hotel amenities were of reasonable quality but frankly just not worth the price. </s>
<s> ; I recently stayed at the Affinia hotel in Chicago ; and was very unhappy when I learned of additional charges upon arrival. </s>
<s> I made the reservations over the phone there was no mention of any internet or parking fees. </s>
<s> I arrive I 'm told fee to valet park is $ 49 per day ; plus another $ 10 for internet. </s>
<s> is just plain ridiculous ; and will remember not to stay here in future. </s>
<s> 's too many other fine hotels that do n't charge these fees. </s>
<s> Hotel Chicago - I stayed in the Omni hotel when I had been to Chicago on a business trip. </s>
<s> had checked in online and was pleased to know that the keys were waiting for me at the front desk. </s>
<s> room was spacious with nice comfortable bed ; with a large bathroom and a hot shower. </s>
<s> view from the room was not that great and even though I could hear a little noise from outside ; it did not disturb my sleep. </s>
<s> service staff were friendly and extremely helpful. </s>
<s> Wi-Fi bandwidth was good and helped me access my work computer without any hassles and disconnections. </s>
<s> hotel was close to where I worked and also to Magnificent Mile and several other shopping attractions and theatres. </s>
<s> Chicago - I booked a classic king room for my interview in Chicago. </s>
<s> room is pretty large for its price. </s>
<s> modern stype decoration gave me a great mood for my interview. </s>
<s> hotel with beautiful scenery ! The staff was wonderful and the rooms were comfortable and spacious. </s>
<s> even had a docking station for my iPod ! We stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker last week and it was really wonderful. </s>
<s> off ; the staff is excellent. </s>
<s> of our needs were addressed quickly and with a smile. </s>
<s> hotel really was the perfect launching pad for us to take in everything that Chicago has to offer. </s>
<s> of the shopping of Michigan Avenue was just steps from our room. </s>
<s> decided to go for the Shedd Aquarium package. </s>
<s> started the day with a really wonderful breakfast at the hotel and then thoroughly enjoyed our " all access pass " to the aquarium ' very cool !. </s>
<s> our long days of sightseeing ' and a quick stop at the wonderful martini bar ; it was so nice to come back to the room which was elegant ; but a very comfortable sanctuary from the busy city. </s>
<s> top it all off ; they have the most incredible shower that I 've ever used ' and ; even better ; it 's all " green " . </s>
<s> more can I say ? The Millennium Knickerbocker was a huge part of what made our vacation so wonderful and memorable. </s>
<s> highly recommend it ! Amalfi Hotel Chicago is just minutes from Navy Pier ; Michigan Avenue ; the Chicago Opera Theater ; The House of Blues ; and the hottest night clubs. </s>
<s> $ 200. </s>
<s> per night ; you can expect the very best from your staff ; and your accomodations. </s>
<s> I arrived for my weekend stay ; I was greeted by a pleasant surprise of wall art ; and eclectic style. </s>
<s> reaching my room ; I was able to relax in peace on the numerous pillows. </s>
<s> did n't choose to use the spa this trip ; but when I come back ; it will be the first item on my list ! The business office was great ; because I had a last minute emergency with work- thank goodness for cocktail hour. </s>
<s> was delicious. </s>
<s> have already told a friend from Naperville that the next time I 'm in town ; she 'll have to stay at Amalfi with me ; instead of commuting. </s>
<s> really missed out ! - Atlanta Girl- My wife and me stayed in the Amalfi Hotel Chicago last August in a weekend visit to Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel is located in the 20 W Kinzie St ; in the well-known River North District. </s>
<s> got what the hotel promised : gentle staff ; a luxury room with a breathtaking view ; magnificent meals and a select wine. </s>
<s> also used its well-equipped gymnasium. </s>
<s> paid $ 586 with taxes for two nights. </s>
<s> think it was a good price ; taking in account the excellent conditions we got there. </s>
<s> would recommend the Amalfi Hotel to anybody with good taste that visits Chicago. </s>
<s> Swissotel Chicago hotel aspires to be a tourist 's paradise ; a hotel so grand and luxurious that you 'd rather stay than return home at the end of your trip. </s>
<s> is it really as magnificent as suggested ? True ; you can get a massage ; the rooms have flat screen T. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and iPod docks ; heck ; there 's even a gym. </s>
<s> the truth is ; you 're really paying much more for a few things you do n't really need. </s>
<s> Swissotel attempts to lure you in with their illusions of grandeur ; when really ; all you 're getting is a Holiday Inn style room with fancy wallpaper and the ability to play tunes from your mp3 player. </s>
<s> dining options are available at the Palm Restaurant. </s>
<s> claim to serve excellent lobster ; yet what I ordered was the size of a craw fish ; and left the taste of a burnt fifty dollar bill in my mouth. </s>
<s> hotel hides behind a velvet curtain ; hoping their facade wo n't be revealed. </s>
<s> my recent weekend stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel ; i was very disappointed. </s>
<s> chose this hotel after scouring various hotel websites in the area. </s>
<s> the look of the website ; my expectations were above average. </s>
<s> felt the website led one to believe it was upscale. </s>
<s> my arrival ; i checked in. </s>
<s> was shown my room and at first glance everything seemed fine with the room. </s>
<s> i was settling into the room ; I began to notice a general lack of cleanliness. </s>
<s> noticed spiderwebs in corners ; and a lack of cleanliness in the bathroom. </s>
<s> ; it was advertised that there was an i pod docking station in the room ; however ; it did not work and I had to call down for them to bring a replacement. </s>
<s> ; as a guest should not have had to call down ; these items should be checked to ensure they work properly before a guest checks in. </s>
<s> found the restaurants on site to be crowded ; loud and not to mention an unusally long wait to be served my meal. </s>
<s> did inquire about a few of the menu items and my waiter seemed to have a lack of knowledge about the menu items. </s>
<s> ; my experience was not good and the next time I am in the area ; I will chose another hotel for my stay. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago for our anniversary. </s>
<s> hotel was beautiful and luxurious as one would expect from a Hilton brand hotel in a major city. </s>
<s> service was excellent with check-in and check-out going smoothly. </s>
<s> location of the hotel was ideal for us as we had plans to attend the theater ; visit the Lincoln Park zoo and picnic by the lake. </s>
<s> of these were very close to our hotel. </s>
<s> price was reasonable for the location and luxurious accommodations. </s>
<s> also enjoyed the hotel restaurant and lounge. </s>
<s> recommend. </s>
<s> Chicago - This place is OK ; just OK ! I have stayed at Intercontinental Chicago more than once but after my recent visit last month ; I think it has lost its 4 and a half star quality. </s>
<s> rooms are spacious but they looked outdated. </s>
<s> wallpaper was old and the bathroom was particularly below standards. </s>
<s> internet was poor especially at my floor and there was no use of complaining ! Its location is still convenient but the charm is gone. </s>
<s> will try out other options for my next trip. </s>
<s> was a great hotel ; one of the nicest that we have stayed in a long time. </s>
<s> wife was absolutely thrilled with the staff and we could n't believe the KimptonKids program at the site. </s>
<s> will be back next time we stop in town. </s>
<s> can not think of a better place to stay. </s>
<s> hotel is great ! I love its interior design of the room. </s>
<s> service is excellent ! And its gym and spa are gorgeous. </s>
<s> you need to go to Chicago ; this hotel would be your best choice ! You can also check its website for the special offer ; I found a great deal on it ! This hotel is rather far from the airport and in traffic it took almost 2 hours to get there. </s>
<s> that time ; I was so tired I was just ready to check in to my room. </s>
<s> stood in line forever as there was only one person working at the front desk. </s>
<s> was only the beginning. </s>
<s> was very noisy outside from people constantly walking around. </s>
<s> guess it 's because they 're located in the middle of the downtown area ; but they could at least make the walls thicker. </s>
<s> do n't want to hear everything going on in my neighbor 's room. </s>
<s> bathroom was not very clean and one of the towels had a hole in it. </s>
<s> toilet ran all night which kept me up along with all the people on the street. </s>
<s> restaurant food was horrible and I would rather buy food from a street vendor than to pay the ridiculously high price they charged for a burger. </s>
<s> ; I was very disappointed with my stay at the Conrad Chicago. </s>
<s> the hotel certainly seems to look beautiful ; the hotel is actually far from it. </s>
<s> booking a room online was rather difficult ; and i was n't able to reach a representative upon calling any of the contact numbers. </s>
<s> general coming here is a bad decision despite how it looks ; its a mistake i wont make again and you should n't either. </s>
<s> stayed at the Knickerbocker Hotel the last time I visited Chicago. </s>
<s> lived in Illinois during college ; and as I was on a college budget ; most of my trips up to the city involved sharing a room at one of the cheaper hotels away from downtown. </s>
<s> my visit back ; I decided I would treat myself to a nicer stay than I was used to ; so I booked a room at the Knickerbocker. </s>
<s> looked nice when I got there ; but for the price I paid ; I was really expecting something far above and beyond what I got. </s>
<s> I was n't dressed right ; or did n't carry the right luggage ; but the front desk clerk was unnecessarily snooty when I checked in. </s>
<s> n't a hotel try to make its guests feel welcome ? When I stayed at the cheap hotels in college ; the front desk employees were always friendly when I checked in and out ; and they would give me good tips on the best way to get to the fun things in the city. </s>
<s> ; I did n't even want to ask for any tips at the front desk because I did n't want to deal with the eye rolling and " too important to be bothered " attitude I got when I checked in. </s>
<s> guess the location was more convenient than the hotels I used to visit ; but I really thought that part of the money I was spending on a nice hotel would pay for a pleasant customer service experience. </s>
<s> ; obviously I can afford to stay at your hotel ; I already booked and paid for the room. </s>
<s> if customer service is n't your number one goal ; making money should be pretty high up on the list ; and making a paying customer feel unwelcome is n't a very good way to secure return business. </s>
<s> doubt I 'll stay here again. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown ; and found it lacking in the quality of their service. </s>
<s> rooms are nice and well furnished ; but the service lacks in some areas. </s>
<s> of the complimentary services include fast-speed wireless internet access ; cardio-fitness and indoor pool ; grocery shopping service and coffee ; tea ; hot chocolate or cider all day long in the lobby 's 24 hour convenience shop. </s>
<s> the wireless internet was spotty at best with really slow speed at times ; the indoor pool was far to cold in my opinion and the cardio equipment was left uncleaned. </s>
<s> grocery shopping service was alright ; although a bit on the slow side and then finally the coffee and hot chocolate in the 24 hour convenience shop were both cold and overall of poor quality. </s>
<s> this Hotel on a scale of 1 to 5 ; I would give it a 3 at best. </s>
<s> the hotel looked absolutely lovely from the outside ; my experience went downhill once I walked in. </s>
<s> lighting is very poor ; which creates such a dark and gloomy atmosphere. </s>
<s> mood was accompanied by less-than-friendly staff members who made our check-in seem like nothing more than a huge hassle. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet night or a nice stay. </s>
<s> definitely would not stay here again. </s>
<s> ! I have been to many hotels as a business man ; and have seen my fair share of garbage dump hotels. </s>
<s> wow ; this hotel was great. </s>
<s> staff was prompt ; the room was extremely clean ; and everything just ran like a well-oiled machine. </s>
<s> was particularly impressed with the fact that the front desk gives out free toiletries and other things. </s>
<s> I have to pay 5$ for a stupid toothbrush ; but not here ! I really enjoyed staying at InterContintental. </s>
<s> was very worried about the Chicago area 's reputation of bad hotels ; but this turned out just great. </s>
<s> time my boss flies me out to Chicago ; I know where I am staying ! HiltonChicago - Incredibly overpriced. </s>
<s> rooms were nice and the architecture of the building itself was really pretty ; and it 's really close to downtown ; but not worth shelling out the extra bucks. </s>
<s> n't even include breakfast -- you had to pay for an upgrade to get " complimentary " breakfast ' it did look good though ; lots of fresh fruit. </s>
<s> '
Front desk people also seemed a little snooty. </s>
<s> Amalfi Hotel advertises itself as a " luxury boutique hotel " and as such I expected my experience there to be somewhat better than average. </s>
<s> ; this was not the case. </s>
<s> room I booked was not clean ; in particular the bathroom looked as if someone had done a very minimal amount of cleaning after the last guest. </s>
<s> was hair in the corners of the room leading me to think the floor had not been swept or cleaned. </s>
<s> addition ; although the room was supposed to be a non-smoking room ; I could still detect the odor of cigarette smoke. </s>
<s> will say that the staff was courteous and the hotel is very well situated in terms of the many restaurants ; sites and shops all within walking distance. </s>
<s> ; given the cost of the room and my experience with the cleanliness of the room ; I would not stay at the Amalfi Hotel again. </s>
<s> family and I vacation in Chicago and stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel. </s>
<s> our arrival we were greeted happily and the kids received FREE bagpacks for their stay which they loved. </s>
<s> staff was great and always greeted us as we walked in and out of the hotel. </s>
<s> even remembered our names ! The location of the hotel was amazing ; right on the Magnificent Mile. </s>
<s> really enjoyed our stay and the kids loved the indoor pool. </s>
<s> would definitely stay there again if I have the chance and would recommend it to anyone I know going to the Chicago area. </s>
<s> work for a software marketing firm ; and that job requires me to travel at least 100 days per year. </s>
<s> spend a large amount of time in hotels. </s>
<s> normally do n't write reviews for hotels ; but the Homewood Suites by Hilton were above and beyond. </s>
<s> 's start where it matters : the rooms. </s>
<s> are top notch. </s>
<s> 's nothing better than walking in to a clean ; beautiful rooms after a long day of travel. </s>
<s> beds are among the best I 've ever slept in in hotels. </s>
<s> rest of the room is just as nice and makes me feel at home. </s>
<s> price : Low. </s>
<s> looked for similar rooms in the area at other hotels ; and everything else was at least 10 % more expensive. </s>
<s> you do n't get what you pay for here. </s>
<s> get much more than that ! The location : Could n't be better. </s>

<s> want a great shopping experience ? Again ; walking distance. </s>
<s> else you want ? Chances are ; it 's within walking distance. </s>
<s> ; one of the best hotels I 've ever stayed in. </s>
<s> was very unsatisfied with my stay at the Allegro. </s>
<s> front desk clerk seemed very put out when we walked up to her window. </s>
<s> giving her our confirmation number she let us know that our rooms were not ready yet. </s>
<s> came as a surprise to me since we arrived late in the day and check in had already began. </s>
<s> waiting an hour to check in we were not able to get the room features that we had requested. </s>
<s> were informed that they were " only requests " and not a guarantee. </s>
<s> service was also very slow and appeared to be understaffed. </s>
<s> we finally got someone to answer the phone they were out of most everything we wanted. </s>

<s> front desk staff was extremely rude upon checking in and even though I had reserved a room with two queen beds ; they told me that " only king bed rooms were available at the time " ; and there was nothing they could do about it. </s>
<s> room itself was a nightmare. </s>
<s> smelled like an ashtray and it was very clear that the bedding was in dire need of replacement. </s>

<s> summed up ; Sofitel is nothing more than a fancy Holiday Inn. </s>
<s> certainly shows that this hotel is part of a chain ; even if it is an international one. </s>
<s> customer service is poor unless you look like you have $ 50 to tip someone. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> but I had looked around online and we had really expected more. </s>

<s> ; I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in Chicago ! Fairmont Chicago - The hotel is centrally located but lacks charisma even after renovation. </s>
<s> breakfast at the hotel is unreasonably expensive but there 's a wonderful cafe just after a minute walk towards Millenium Park. </s>
<s> sad part is that the hotel does n't have a swimming pool and had to go to neighbouring health club for that. </s>
<s> design of bathroom is good but a double vanity would have been expected and rooms are ok. </s>
<s> disappointment is truely in service where they brought another brand of wine to the room instead of the ordered one. </s>
<s> they informed first about this ; atleast honesty of the staff would have been appreciated. </s>
<s> seems that time arrived to look for the hotels with better experience and reasonable tariff. </s>

<s> James Hotel in Chicago looks nice on the website ; but looks can be deceiving ! The employees are extremely rude and the rooms are disgusting. </s>

<s> We had booked five rooms for a conference in the area and I can honestly say we all felt a bit shafted after our stay. </s>
<s> rooms themselves were comfortable enough ; standard hotel fare. </s>
<s> ; the staff was cold and difficult to get ahold of at times. </s>
<s> most importantly ; the wifi service was not offered for free. </s>

<s> here for a business meeting ; I felt slightly indulgent and decided to book this hotel. </s>
<s> my initial hesitation ; I must say that I do n't regret my decision at all !

<s> done a lot of acting in the past ; I very much enjoyed the Cadillac Palace Theatre ; located so close by ! Overall ; I could n't have asked for a more enjoyable 'relaxing experience !

<s> at all costs ! I traveled to Chicago recently with my giant German Shepard dog Rex and picked the Hard Rock Hotel for the perfect location and because a close friend had warmly recommended their pet friendliness. </s>
<s> service truly is incredible. </s>
<s> even had a web-cam so I could check in on Rex while I was out for dinner in the evening and a friendly staff member took him for a walk when I could not make it home from a meeting the day after. </s>
<s> rooms really rock ' pardon the pun. </s>
<s> like the cheap plastic laminated stained carpet decor so common in other places that allow pets. </s>
<s> easy chair looked so good that I was almost afraid Rex would snack on it while I was out ; but he seemed to like the guitar chew-toy that came with the pet package better. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend the Hard Rock Hotel to my friends - whether they travel with or without pets. </s>
<s> just came back from this awesome ; terrific hotel last week ; and I have to say -- I loved it ! My wife and I were there for a week due to a business meeting ; and right when I stepped into the hotel ; I knew that this business vacation will be well spent. </s>

<s> I headed down to the lobby for my conference ; I got lost ; and asked one of the people who worked there where my meeting might be held. </s>
<s> leaded me to the door ; and I was very impressed. </s>
<s> is a fitness center which I went everyday ; and this great restaurant called C-House situated nicely next to the hotel lobby ; where I had a nice steak and my wife a salad. </s>

<s> settling in and resting for a while I called room service and ordered some dinner which was provided very quickly and tasted like something out of a 5 star restaurant. </s>

<s> up to seeing Lake Michigan was a site not to miss. </s>

<s> Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago - I 'm kind of torn on this one. </s>
<s> really want to give this hotel a good rating. </s>
<s> food and room service were great ; and the room definitely looked fantastic. </s>
<s> I ca n't get over the fact that the beds just feel like one of those old spring mattresses ; you know ? Add that to the fact that the hotel 's proximity to the Magnificent Mile means that there 's lot of noise at night ; and I was tossing and turning for most of my nights here. </s>
<s> considering how important a good night 's rest is ; this makes it really difficult for me to recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> someone who sleeps more soundly than me would find this place better. </s>
<s> will not be back to this hotel. </s>
<s> are several reasons for this ; but it began at check-in when the staff were very rude and uptight. </s>
<s> reservation was lost in the system and they seemed to think it was a strain on their time to have to find it. </s>
<s> room was OK ; but the beds were hard and uncomfortable. </s>
<s> room next door had their TV turned up very loudly ; and when we called to ask if we could change rooms were were told that was not an option. </s>
<s> did n't offer any other solutions. </s>
<s> food in the restaurants was extremely overpriced and not cooked to our requests. </s>
<s> ; we wish that we had chosen a different hotel for our stay in Chicago. </s>
<s> Omni Hotels ; Chicago - My experience with the Omni has not been satisfactory. </s>
<s> room service was late most of the times and the fact that the food was not amazing did not make the wait worth it. </s>
<s> rooms were big and clean but the cleaning were not properly trained. </s>
<s> ; a cleanig lady barged into my room without knocking which was irritating. </s>
<s> internet speed was also largely shaky bordering around low speed most of the times. </s>
<s> only good part ; for me ; probably was the gym which was really equipped and beautiful. </s>
<s> the whole ; I would not recommend this hotel for a short stay. </s>
<s> made regular business trips to Chicago ; I decided to stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago ; since it was fairly new and I had a friend that had stayed there. </s>
<s> Lobby was quite small ; which surprised me with a name like Monaco. </s>
<s> a matter of fact I found the furnishings to be quite drab. </s>
<s> boy took my luggage and showed me to the suite. </s>
<s> was two rooms ; not as spacious as I would have liked ; an entertainment room ; and a bedroom with a standard television. </s>
<s> You imagine ; I was expecting H. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; but it was just ordinary cable. </s>
<s> $ 600 a night you would expect a 42 inch set. </s>

<s> view did not take in the Lake ; unfortunately ; just the Magic Mile. </s>
<s> ; I am starving so time to eat. </s>
<s> restaurant was well appointed ; I hope the food was as good. </s>
<s> ordered lamb chops ; potatoes au gratin and mint sauce. </s>

<s> Rock Hotel boats that they have the best of the high scale accommodations for your business or pleasure stays. </s>
<s> they fail to disclose is just how expensive your stay will be. </s>
<s> service tends to be heavily influenced by the wealth of the patrons ; service is more redily available and friendly the more you make. </s>
<s> rooms are furnished with attractive but old furnishings. </s>
<s> laundry service leaves more to be desired. </s>
<s> sheets have a gray tint to them and the rooms smell of tobacco. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel and was disappointed with not only the service but the cleanliness of the room from the bathroom to the bedding. </s>
<s> stay at any hotel should be memorable and restful-after all isnt that what we pay for ? The Ambassador East is a particularly crappy property ; given the numerous quality hotels in and around the Gold Coast. </s>
<s> ; I saw an amazing rate and decided to book -- this experience will be a reminder that you get what you pay for. </s>
<s> the lobby was gorgeous ' and appears to match the photos on the website the room I was assigned was run down ; and looked nothing like the photos posted on the website. </s>
<s> looked like someone had put a quick coat of paint on the walls ; but the furniture was old and the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty. </s>
<s> room also smelled of must or mildew. </s>
<s> the room did have air-conditioning as advertised ; it was an in-window unit that sounded like it was on its last leg. </s>
<s> was only here for a single night ; but had I been here for anywhere longer I would have requested a refund. </s>
<s> ; if you 're staying in this part of town ; do yourself a favor and book at any one of the numerous other properties around here. </s>
<s> Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn are both nearby ; clean ; and often have special-offers -- these are n't the only properties in the area ; but both of these will save you a potentially unpleasant stay. </s>
<s> - I was n't expecting much from a guest room at a place like the Fairmont ; but I was surprised to see that even the modest amenities here are quite comfortable. </s>
<s> any room on the cheaper side of a hotel ; there are cheesy things like floral paintings and a bible in the drawer ; but this one somehow does it with a bit of class. </s>
<s> tub being separate from the shower was kind of a nice touch and it has a great view of the Chicago skyline For 250 dollars ; cheapest room available at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago ; you would assume you would have access to wifi. </s>
<s> ; that was not the case. </s>
<s> was told I " could have had " internet if I had booked through the site ; which I didnt. </s>

<s> out to the top with luxuries you could only dream of ; it is an amazing experience ! It 's located right in the middle of everything in Chicago ; and pulls in all the best attributes of the city into one fun filled experience. </s>

<s> beautiful experience that I would certainly do again ! My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for a fun anniversary weekend away from the kids. </s>
<s> check in we were pleasantly surprised by the decor ; the location to so many downtown attractions and the attentiveness of the staff. </s>

<s> Chicago - It was the best hotel I have stayed at in Chicago. </s>
<s> and my fiance stayed there for two nights and the stay was absolutely amazing. </s>
<s> location is great as the hotel is right in the center of the city. </s>
<s> rooms are luxurious ; with comfortable beds and exquisite bathrooms. </s>
<s> ENTIRE staff at the hotel was service oriented. </s>
<s> service was great and the receptionist was very helful in getting the room ; helping in booking the cab etc. </s>
<s> Liquid Lounge is top notch. </s>
<s> both had a wonderful time there and would love to visit again. </s>
<s> Chicago - I wanted to like this hotel . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  it has several things going for it : an elegant modern style ; luxurious furnishings and amenities ; and large rooms with spectacular views - in fact ; almost all the rooms ' except the ones on the western face of the hotel overlook scenic sections of Grant Park and Lake Michigan. </s>
<s> while it was nice to look at ; it was not exactly a pleasure to actually live there. </s>
<s> ; they are either under-staffed or over-booked - the hotel was so crowded when I stayed there last June that noise and service became issues. </s>
<s> lobbies were so full that I could n't ever find a place to sit down ; and they were a chore to wade through as I travelled to and from my room. </s>
<s> staff was reasonably pleasant ; but they just could n't adequately serve all of their guests. </s>
<s> 'check-out took at least an hour ; and I think they managed to get around to cleaning my bed linens only once during my five-day stay. </s>
<s> would have liked to take advantage of the exercise spaces they advertised ; but they happened to be closed for renovation. </s>
<s> two main restaurants inside the hotel ; a grill and an Irish pub ; often had waiting times upwards of 45 min during peak hours. </s>
<s> top it all off ; they were generally too noisy for me to carry on a conversation with the other people at the table. </s>
<s> noise was an even bigger problem at night ; however - between standard city sounds like cars and sirens in the streets and the neighbors talking through the paper-thin walls ; I hardly slept. </s>
<s> there were a few good restaurants near the hotel that I was able to escape to for a bit of peace. </s>
<s> 's at least three different pizza places about a block away ; but if you want something a little more upscale and still Italian ' my favorite ; I suggest you try Gioco as it 's only a bit more of a walk. </s>
<s> ; my experience here was n't horrible ; but I ca n't quite justify the price of admission ; given the spotty service and my issues with the noise. </s>
<s> room cost a steep $ 250 dollars per night ; which I now wish I had spent site-seeing around Chicago while staying somewhere cheaper instead. </s>
<s> you 've got a car ; it 's even worse : parking costs $ 45. </s>
<s> a short time during vacation I had rented a room from The Ambassador East Hotel ; I have to say I was quite impressed with what I experienced and would referre others looking to stay in a hotel to that given location. </s>
<s> hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed ; and trust me I am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot. </s>
<s> food is good ; location is great ; everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here. </s>
<s> Palmer House - 'Warning The Palmer House made a bad on me right away. </s>
<s> was unable to get a shuttle from the airport to the hotel ; and when I called asking about the next one they said that it was not running for the day. </s>
<s> my expensive cab ride to the hotel ; I was dissapointed to see that the room looked nothing like the website described. </s>
<s> was small and crowded with unecessary furniture. </s>
<s> did not sleep well on the bed ; although I am a picky sleeper. </s>
<s> must admit that the atmosphere of the lobby and the common areas of the hotel were very nice ; and I really enjoyed using their gym facilities in the basement ; but that was not enough to make up for my lackluster experience with the customer service and my room. </s>
<s> next time I travel to Chicago I will be trying a different hotel because the Palmer House did not live up to the expectations set by their price and the Hilton name. </s>
<s> you enter the lobby at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel you immediately see that this is a special place where you are going to be pampered. </s>
<s> staff are very friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to assist you in any way they can. </s>
<s> check in process is smooth and friendly as I expected. </s>
<s> you enter your room the decor catches your eye. </s>
<s> yet not stuffy is how I describe it. </s>
<s> restroom tub is large and made of marble. </s>
<s> whole room is tasteful and made to make you feel special yet at home. </s>
<s> highly recommend The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel to anybody looking to escape for a while. </s>
<s> staff ; clean building and rooms. </s>

<s> always prepay online so I literally get my room key in a minute ; never any hassle. </s>
<s> is good ; buffet style breakfast and decent dinner. </s>
<s> better ; there a bunch of excellent restaurants within a few blocks. </s>
<s> only complaint would be that your stay can definitely be effected by what side of the hotel your room is on. </s>
<s> east ; there is a great view of the harbor ; but the westside overlooks a busy street that can be noisy long into the night. </s>
<s> staff is very willing to accommodate any such concerns if you explicitly ask ; but otherwise it can be a bit of a crapshoot. </s>

<s> room was not particularly well-cleaned : we found previous guests hair in the bathroom sink and on the floor ; and a film of dust across the television set. </s>
<s> are not the type to complain ; so we went out to explore the city and assumed that would be the worst of it. </s>

<s> were tossing and turning half the night. </s>
<s> the morning we hoped a quick workout might help energize us for the day ; but we discovered that the wellness and fitness center described on the website was really not at all what we anticipated : a few treadmills and a dilapidated weight rack. </s>
<s> concierge was almost never around in the lobby ' her sign always said " Be right back ! " and when we did ask her questions ; she was actually somewhat cold and rude towards us. </s>
<s> second night was without incident ; luckily ; except for the terrible bed ; but the third night we were woken up three times by hotel staff trying to enter the room to clean despite our " Do Not Disturb " sign. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel. </s>

<s> we finally got up to our room ; we opened the door and found someone else was already in it ! Yes ; the front desk clerk actually checked us into an occupied room and basically gave us a key to someone else 's room. </s>
<s> went back to the clerk who checked us in ' skipping the still present line ; which got us annoyed stares from the other people waiting and told him the problem. </s>
<s> ; he was already helping another guest checkin and made us wait until he was done with that person before helping us. </s>
<s> did apologize for the mix up and then went into the back room to find out what to do. </s>
<s> took a ' very long time. </s>
<s> was a good 10-15 minutes until he came back. </s>
<s> said there were no more rooms available of the type we had booked and the only ones they had left were on a lower floor with no view. </s>
<s> hotel offered us a discount off the regular price for these ; but when we got to this new room ; we found out why these rooms had n't been taken. </s>

<s> sure to rent the Fender guitars ; if you have some musical talent. </s>
<s> is free ; and for somebody like me who only has a cheap nothing guitar at home ; it honestly may have been the highlight of the trip. </s>
<s> way too much time just fiddling around with the guitar in the room. </s>
<s> arrived at the hotel 15 minutes prior to check in time as they recommend. </s>
<s> I get there I noticed that there is a couple and two other people waiting in line to check in. </s>
<s> minutes later after standing there with my suitcase ; the woman at the front desk informs us that their computers are down due to a recent update to the software. </s>
<s> told us to wait until the computers booted back up. </s>
<s> asked if I could drop my suitcase off at the room and she said no because they need to electronically activate the cards and with the computers down they could n't activate the cards. </s>

<s> for the price I paid ; I was expecting much better acommodations. </s>
<s> I arrived around 10 : 30 the night I checked in ' delayed flight I did not get the concierge service as it stops at 10. </s>
<s> find that an odd hour to stop a service like that especially when you 're expecting a guest who has not checked in yet. </s>
<s> that ; it took them 20 minutes to get me into my room. </s>
<s> it was a room mix-up ; then it was a missing key card. </s>

<s> Recently renovated " apparently means it was redone in the last decade ; not the last year. </s>
<s> was just very tired-looking. </s>
<s> very disappointing was the food ; and the service was hit or miss. </s>
<s> expected better from a hotel of this caliber. </s>

<s> I could not quite make out the words of their conversations ; I could definitely hear their voices as more than just a murmer. </s>
<s> addition ; I was awakened several times by people conversing in the hallway as they walked by my door ; presumably on the way to their rooms. </s>
<s> ; I am a light sleeper ; but this was ridiculous. </s>
<s> you decide to stay here ; I suggest that you check your bill very carefully before check out. </s>
<s> I checked mine ; I found that I was being charged a rate higher than the one that I was supposed to be charged. </s>
<s> had to wait in line at the front desk for someone to help me ' and the front desk service is woefully slow and finally had to ask to speak to a supervisor before the error could be corrected. </s>
<s> ; though I had been told upon check-in that my room had been recently updated ; I can not believe that statement was accurate. </s>
<s> room appeared to be rather dated in its furnishings and decor and the carpet appeared to be somewhat worn. </s>
<s> in all ; I round my stay at this hotel to be disappointing. </s>
<s> time I will arrange to stay elsewhere. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the amalfi hotel in Chicago and was very disappointed right from the beginning. </s>

<s> bars are located on the premises ; which is appealing at first. </s>
<s> inside ; patrons do not receive the quality of service that is to be expected and there is a complete absence of privacy ; of any kind. </s>

<s> had me booked in the wrong kind of room and when I asked about changing it ; I was snubbed and made to feel like it was a tremendous imposition for them to accommodate me. </s>
<s> a half hour ; I finally received the correct room. </s>
<s> linens on the bed were of a very cheap quality ; they were scratchy and had a musty smell. </s>
<s> ; the bathroom was n't cleaned properly as there was still trash in the waste basket ' including a condom and there was no shampoo. </s>
<s> ; I had a coffee pot in the room but no coffee. </s>
<s> I called the front desk to ask for some ; they told be it was not free and would I like to charge the coffee to my account. </s>
<s> found this hotel to be shocking and highly recommend that no one stay there. </s>

<s> customer service was amazing. </s>
<s> the time we booked our packege to the time we checked in everything was absolutely amazing. </s>
<s> people were proficient ; respectful and very thoughtful. </s>

<s> could n't decide where I wanted to go first ! After we put our bags up we headed down to the wine room . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
It was totally delicious. </s>
<s> also got free wine just because it was our honeymoon ! Then after a few glasses of wine we hit the spa ; once again excellent ! Everything smells like honeysuckle and everyone smiles all the time. </s>
<s> stayed in the gold room. </s>
<s> it was a little bit smaller than I thought it would be I was definitely satisfied with the huge king bed with even bigger pillows. </s>

<s> was a wonderful experience that I will never forget. </s>
<s> thumbs up ! I recently stayed at the Amalfi Chicago with my wife on a business trip. </s>
<s> decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded. </s>
<s> enjoyed the luxurious in-room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city. </s>
<s> individualized attention from check-in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service. </s>
<s> Amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more. </s>
<s> weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site. </s>
<s> hotel 's design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses. </s>
<s> of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable. </s>
<s> is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt. </s>
<s> of European descent ; I enjoyed the croissants ; whole grain muffins ; real butter and marmalade. </s>
<s> also brought along our Standard Poodle ; Sterling ; and the Amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family. </s>
<s> purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed Sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings. </s>
<s> slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling " at home " while away. </s>
<s> pet lovers this is a big plus. </s>
<s> ; transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal. </s>
<s> allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this ; another appreciated bonus of our stay. </s>
<s> you Amalfi for a superb experience. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel was a delight to stay at. </s>
<s> 've never been to Chicago before ; but the location was fantastic. </s>
<s> had all sorts of different rooms ; from non-smoking to smoking to hypo-allergenic rooms. </s>
<s> 've never seen so many options for rooms. </s>
<s> room I stayed in was well worth the nightly price. </s>
<s> location was so close to all the activities my husband and I had planned for our vacation. </s>
<s> have never been treated so much like royalty than at the Chicago Hyatt Regency. </s>
<s> Chicago - Stayed at the Conrad Chicago recently with my family. </s>
<s> real complaints about the hotel itself - room was a good size ; good decor ; nice and clean ' although when you 're paying over $ 250 a night ; you would n't expect anything less. </s>
<s> '
The staff ; however ; left a lot to be desired. </s>
<s> interactions with several staff members who should have been a lot more catering to our needs since they 're working in the service industry for such an upscale hotel. </s>
<s> example ; one morning ; the maid who serviced our room knocked on our door a little before we were getting ready to leave for the day. </s>
<s> told her we would be leaving soon and she could come back in 15 or so minutes. </s>
<s> to the Lincoln Park Zoo for the day. </s>
<s> several hours later ; and the maid was just starting to service our room ! We had to go and sit in the lobby for 20 minutes ; waiting for her to finish. </s>
<s> worst was when we voiced our complaints to the front desk ; they did n't seem concerned at all ; and basically ignored what we were saying. </s>
<s> time we 're in Chicago ; we 'll be trying a different hotel. </s>
<s> recently stayed in a room at the trendy Talbott Hotel. </s>
<s> looked nice on the outside so I decided to them a whirl. </s>
<s> soon as I walked in I noticed that there were n't alot of hotel employees. </s>
<s> ; the large hotel are swarming with service people ready to lend a hand. </s>
<s> was tired and I needed a nice room so as I approached the front desk I noticed something odd. </s>
<s> was sitting out right in front of the front desk. </s>
<s> were talking different items such as bagels and muffins from the left over breakfast rush. </s>
<s> everywhere especially where I was suppose to exchange cash and room keys. </s>
<s> 's just say it was n't professional. </s>
<s> room was average and the bathroom did n't carry the kinds of brands I would have liked to see. </s>
<s> Wi-Fi connection and I had to walk down the hall for ice. </s>
<s> about lack of customer service. </s>
<s> in all ; the stay was sub-par and nothing special. </s>
<s> stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers for three days while I was in Chicago on business. </s>
<s> was quite possibly the best hotel experience that I have ever had ; which says a lot considering the fact that I stay in hotels quite frequently. </s>
<s> staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating. </s>
<s> made sure that I had absolutely everything that I could want or need. </s>
<s> friendliness came across in a very genuine manner ; not fake or forced like some employees can be. </s>
<s> room itself was to die for. </s>
<s> bedding was so soft and the room was extremely clean and well kept. </s>
<s> can not speak highly enough about the quality of the mattress and bedding ! Because of the mattress and bedding ; I got the best three nights of sleep I 've ever had. </s>
<s> views of downtown Chicago were absolutely amazing from my room. </s>
<s> way the city lights sparkled stole my heart and almost made me want to move to Chicago. </s>
<s> food was amazing also. </s>
<s> made it a point to eat at all three of the hotel 's restaurants and visit the bar while I was there. </s>
<s> favorite restaurant of the three was Shula 's Steak House. </s>
<s> Chi Bar ; the hotel 's bar ; was amazingly designed and the drinks were great. </s>
<s> in all ; i would rate my experience a 5 out of 5. </s>
<s> is nowhere else in downtown Chicago that compares to the Sheraton. </s>
<s> Chicago - I stayed at the Conrad Chicago last month when I was in town for a business trip. </s>
<s> room was a good size ; and I loved the view of the city at night from my window. </s>
<s> it was really nice having the free internet access from my room - I get so annoyed when hotels charge you extra for it. </s>
<s> did n't have a chance to use the fitness center ; but I did walk by it ; and it seemed bigger than most hotels. </s>
<s> open 24 '7 which is nice. </s>
<s> ; do n't really have any complaints. </s>
<s> will consider staying here next time I 'm in Chicago ; especially if I can get a good deal ! Our stay at the Hilton Chicago was a pleasure from arrival to departure. </s>
<s> staff was super friendly and helpful ; the room was very clean and the location was fantastic. </s>
<s> walking track was an especially nice touch. </s>
<s> recommended ! This hotel seems to take everything about luxury and force it down your throat. </s>
<s> first place it attacks you is directly inside of your pocket. </s>
<s> place looks alright in the lobby ; but when needing a place to stay during the midweek for a convention or to just sightseer in Chicago ; this is far too much to spend on a place to sleep for a night. </s>
<s> the Ambassador East Hotel has not taken into account that we are in a recession. </s>
<s> to mention that it is at least 30-40 minutes from the airport in traffic. </s>
<s> traffic is stressful enough without having to worry about how quickly the airport can be reached ; particularly if the front desk forgets to give you a wakeup call. </s>
<s> just spent the weekend here with my wife ; and she loved it as much as I do. </s>
<s> was here several weeks ago for a work trip booked by the company to show our staff off to some big clients ; so I did n't have any choice. </s>
<s> when my wife said she wanted to come to Chicago ; I knew this was the place to take her. </s>
<s> hotel has n't just been remodeled ; it 's been completely redesigned. </s>
<s> have been moved around to make the flow of the public spaces work better ; and the two rooms that I 've seen are showplaces. </s>
<s> are amazing. </s>
<s> hotel is part of a luxury chain ; and it 's easy to see why. </s>
<s> offer full room service at convenient hours. </s>
<s> 've been in every eating area now ; and they are all great ; too. </s>
<s> for business or pleasure ; you ca n't beat this. </s>
<s> 's a luxury hotel with all the luxurious features you 'd expect. </s>
<s> wife was stunned ; and yours will be ; too. </s>
<s> Chicago - It 's really a mess when I arrived at the hotel ; there 's only one receptionist dealing with 5 customers. </s>
<s> have to wait for 15 minutes to begin my check in. </s>
<s> room is clean and neat ; but a little small for its high price. </s>
<s> bathroom is uncleaned ; which is really annoying. </s>
<s> have to asked the room service to clean it after I arrived. </s>
<s> Hotel Chicago has several factors that make it one of the best hotels in the chicago area and an experience you will not forget in a long time. </s>
<s> proximity to some of the best spots in Chicago makes it a visitor 's delight. </s>
<s> is close to the Magnificient Mile which is the shopping area ; it is also close to the Loop ; Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue making it a fantastic location with great layout and it has lots of space. </s>
<s> guest room includes a flat screen HD TV. </s>
<s> beautiful reception has free snacks and drinks even as the hotel provides free breakfast. </s>
<s> 24-hour fitness centre is always open for business. </s>
<s> hotel has a no-smoking policy. </s>
<s> also has free internet facilities ; room service ; Air conditioning ; laundry 'drycleaning ; multilingual staff to make communication easy ; spa services ; heating ; conference facilities ; satelite tv ; brailed elevators and pets are allowed. </s>
<s> Concierge desk offer the best wine available and I must add that the wine is great. </s>
<s> hotel prides itself in making you feel like royalty. </s>
<s> staff are very pleasant and the door men are always willing to lend a hand. </s>
<s> hotel places priority on cleanliness as the rooms are always clean. </s>
<s> hotel makes it possible for you to relax ; go shopping in the best stores which are close-by ; eat in some of the best restaurants and party in clubs most of which they have entered into some form patnership. </s>
<s> offer great deals for every type of customer. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend this place. </s>
<s> Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is by far the best experience I have ever had away from home. </s>
<s> the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby ; you will never want to leave. </s>
<s> multiple ballrooms ; board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events. </s>
<s> you 're looking for leisure activities ; there are two bars ; the Lockwood Wine Cellar ; and an indoor pool. </s>
<s> staff is professional ; friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> service is excellent ; and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city. </s>
<s> recently was in Chicago on business and chose to stay at the Swissotel ; Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel sells itself as being stylish ; sophisticated and luxurious and says it is in the center of the city. </s>
<s> would have been better off anywhere else. </s>
<s> was not impressed with the interior ; finding them bordering on clinical and too modern for my taste. </s>
<s> guess ' stylish might be modern in some people 's minds ; but not mine. </s>
<s> ; luxury to me means plush not hard and clinical. </s>
<s> I made my way to reception ; I hardly encountered the friendly customer service boasted of on the website. </s>
<s> had organized an executive suite as I was planning to work some of the time from my hotel room ; and thought the extra space would come in handy. </s>
<s> I proceeded to check in ; the girl at the desk told me ; while smacking gum ; that I had no reservation. </s>
<s> handed over my booking confirmation and she told me that at first she had spelled my name wrong ; even though I had spelled it out for her. </s>
<s> then proceeded to tell me that due to a conference ; all of the executive suites had already been allocated ; but that they would be happy to assign me to a lake view room. </s>
<s> me if I am wrong ; but this is a step down from the room I had asked for ! Surely if you give away my room ; you should try to compensate me with something better ! I said that no ; I really needed more space as I would be using the room as an office ; and finally she said that they did have a corner king room available ; and that if I wanted to switch the following evening ; I would be welcome to do that. </s>
<s> room was ok ; although ; again ; I was disappointed by how cold and clinical it felt. </s>
<s> did attempt to make use of some of the hotel services ; but found them sadly lacking. </s>
<s> comments on the services : the high speed wireless was not available in the room unless you were willing to pay a fee for a cable to connect ; and also a per day fee which borders on extortion ! There was free wifi in the lobby ; but requires you to sit near the doors which open constantly letting in freezing blasts of air ; plus deal with the noise and bustle of people constantly coming in and out. </s>
<s> did phone room service on my arrival to request an extra pillow and towels ; but had to wait 2 hours before they arrived. </s>
<s> fitness center and pool which I was looking forward to using ; were closed for cleaning when I went up. </s>
<s> the next morning consisted of continental items ; which is not what I would have expected for the money. </s>
<s> in all ; I would say your money is better spent elsewhere. </s>
<s> my latest business trip ; both me and my wife recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in Chicago ; Illinois ; at one of their Deluxe suites. </s>
<s> ; and I think I speak for both of us ; we were not fully satisfied with the hotel. </s>
<s> hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations ; and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures ; the service is certainly sub-par. </s>
<s> one plans a stay at such an establishment ; they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in. </s>
<s> of all ; the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on ; the air coming out seemed musty. </s>
<s> of all ; the fitness center was only open until 10 : 30 pm. </s>
<s> people who like to exercise after dinner ; this can certainly be a problem. </s>
<s> considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight. </s>
<s> these ; as well as other similar reasons ; I would not recommend this hotel ; if one is looking for luxury accommodations. </s>
<s> experience with the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was Terrible ! I arrived exactly at my check in time only to be told my room would not be ready for another hour. </s>
<s> chose to wait patiently at the hotel bar and found myself again disappointed I sat for 15 minutes before the bar tender served me and the drink I received was warm. </s>
<s> the room was finally ready I was horrified to find hairs in the bathtub and mysterious spots on the bedding. </s>
<s> I called down to housekeeping the staff was very rude and maid who they sent up to change my sheets acted annoyed and muttered under her breath the whole time she was changing our sheets and cleaning the bathroom. </s>
<s> all this hassle I would normally expect at least a complimentary beverage but not only was that not offered I found even using internet at this location involved a rather exorbitant fee 13. </s>
<s> for a 24 hour period. </s>
<s> was shocked having stayed at a variety of higher end hotels I have never once been asked to pay extra for my wifi access. </s>
<s> I was highly disappointed with my stay and will not be returning to the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel any time soon. </s>
<s> away from the Hyatt Regency Chicago. </s>
<s> recently had to spend the weekend in Chicago on business ; and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town ; but alas ; I was left disappointed. </s>
<s> arrived in the afternoon ; my flight having been delayed ; ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening. </s>
<s> ; my room was not ready. </s>
<s> should have been ready hours earlier ; but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff. </s>
<s> any event ; I was advised to wait in the bar ; creatively named BIG Bar. </s>
<s> seemed annoyed that I wanted only water ; not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that I spent time in their hideously noisy establishment -- I wanted only to relax in my room. </s>
<s> waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk. </s>
<s> my room ready yet ? ' What room ? they replied. </s>
<s> my astonishment ; it seemed that I no longer had a reservation ! How this came to pass ; I do not know ; and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me. </s>
<s> explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned ; or furnished ; or renovated ; or whatever they were doing to make it ready ; but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer ; who spake " Guest Not Found " or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters. </s>
<s> requested the manager ; who was unavailable ; presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either. </s>
<s> ; I admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel ; with fewer regrets than I would have imagined ; to find a better place to spend the night -- a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point. </s>
<s> it was ; I found another hotel ; better priced ; better staffed ; and with rooms ready for my custom. </s>
<s> if you are looking an experience like no other ; book a room at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. </s>
<s> you want a place to sleep ; look elsewhere. </s>
<s> Chicago-The James is in a really convenient location ; just a couple blocks east of the Red Line and right by Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> having a room on the fourth floor by the elevators ; the noise was pretty minimal. </s>
<s> staff were really helpful and welcoming ; giving it a very good atmosphere. </s>
<s> a rate of $ 255 ; it was a very good value ; I would stay here again. </s>
<s> had reservations to check into the Chicago Conrad. </s>
<s> we arrived my wife and I were told the hotel was oversold and that I would have to take a double room rather than a king. </s>
<s> was a special weekend for my wife and I so this was a big disappointment. </s>
<s> were offered a free dinner which we accepted. </s>
<s> restaurant was dark and the food was fairly good. </s>
<s> tub in the bathroom was clogged with hair and we had to call maintenance to repair. </s>
<s> took about an hour to resolve. </s>
<s> we would not pick this hotel again. </s>
<s> should make sure all commitments are met and rooms are in excellent condition. </s>
<s> feel it was not a good value. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago is one of the most beautiful hotels that I have ever stayed at. </s>
<s> stayed there for 3 days and two nights. </s>
<s> room had an amazing view and was clean and furnished beautifully. </s>
<s> staff was very kind and very helpful. </s>
<s> concierge staff was kind and helped me to find enjoyable things to do in Chicago. </s>
<s> ; A beautiful hotel in a beautiful city. </s>
<s> Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel ; I had read some very good reviews of this hotel before I booked my stay ; so perhaps my expectations were too high. </s>
<s> I was quite disappointed and even a little ' creeped out ?by the guy they sent up for my in-room massage. </s>
<s> room seemed very small considering how much it cost and everything in it just seemed a little over-the-top ' overly ornate woodwork ; fussy furniture ; and garish paintings made it seem like they were trying too hard ; but not quite succeeding. </s>
<s> for the masseur ; there was nothing specifically wrong ; but he just came across as kind of inappropriate. </s>
<s> also claim to be in a great location in the heart of Chicago ; but my room did n't have any of the wonderful views of the skyline they show on their website ' however ; it did have lots of traffic noise. </s>
<s> do n't think I 'll be going back anytime soon. </s>
<s> is placed in downtown Chicago what makes it really loud ; it is hard to sleep during the night because all the " city " noises coming from the outside. </s>
<s> rooms in reality are also smaller than they look at at the pictures. </s>
<s> stayed in this hotel for weekend trip with my husband ; and we supposed to get room with king size bad ; but instead we got ; two single beds. </s>
<s> stuff is n't really very nice either ; they seems like they make you a favor just by talking to you. </s>
<s> Chicago Millennium Park - Stayed for 2 days for business. </s>
<s> service ; great room. </s>
<s> wine bar in the lobby is a coffee bar in the morning ; which saved me from running around to find a Starbucks nearby. </s>
<s> found my room to be very large ; but I may just be used to tiny NYC hotel rooms. </s>
<s> addition to the standard desk ; bed ; bed stand and chair ; there was a table in the center of the room and a couch underneath the window ; and despite all of that furniture there was plenty of floor space. </s>
<s> only gripe was that there was n't much of a view - from the 16th floor ; if you sat on the couch by the window and looked out the corner you could see the lake ; but otherwise all I could see was the face of the building on the opposing street. </s>
<s> 've never written a review before ; but I just had to share my experience with Chicago 's InterContinental Hotel. </s>
<s> booked a weekend at this hotel for my wife 's birthday. </s>
<s> 've never stayed at a luxury hotel before and I thought this would be a great experience for us. </s>
<s> horrors started when we first got to the counter. </s>
<s> clerk mixed up our rooms and when I pointed this out he got really snooty with me. </s>
<s> get to our room and the maid had n't cleaned it yet ! We had to wait around for that ; so we went to the hotel 's restaurant and the food was terrible and overpriced. </s>
<s> our room is finished and the the " view " we were promised was non-existent. </s>

So things started off on the wrong foot anyhow. </s>

<s> disappointment continued after I entered the bathroom and found that it not only reeked of smoke ; but also outfitted with the cheapest trimmings possible. </s>
<s> stayed my two nights ; and was surprised to find out that all sorts of other charges were added to my room ' for which I was not responsible ; charged on demand movies ; an empty mini bar ; AND for smoking in the bathroom. </s>

<s> hotel is near a metro station so it is convenient for people like us who do n't have a car. </s>
<s> might be a classy looking hotel in downtown Chicago ; and while the location is not bad ; the rooms are definitely hit or miss. </s>
<s> range from the super basic " affordable " room to the presidential and huge suites that only presidents could probably even afford. </s>
<s> so many different room options ; it 's no wonder they have difficulty honoring your exact reservation if you check-in past 4 : 00 pm. </s>
<s> hotel has a decent pool ; but the health club is extra per day ; as are many other services at the hotel. </s>
<s> 'd imagine that for the price of a stay here $ 160 up to multiple hundreds that more things would be included ! Additionally ; the check-in staff was a bit snobby and unhelpful. </s>
<s> really would expect great service for the high price of a stay here. </s>
<s> I were to return to Chicago again ; I 'd definitely try out staying somewhere else. </s>
<s> hotel is located right in the hustle and bustle of the city of Chicago. </s>

<s> was a TV ; and the beds were fine. </s>
<s> I could n't quite understand why they had Wifi and no computer. </s>

<s> mean the food available there was n't very tasty at all. </s>
<s> had to wait in a long line to get the ticket and I was also hoping to browse the internet ; but they had no computer ; only wifi. </s>
<s> 's like only having bread ; without any fillings to make it into a sandwich ! I stayed at the Fairmont Chicago at Millenium Park while I was interviewing with a financial firm in the city. </s>
<s> was amazed by the style and class of the place as soon as I walked into the lobby. </s>
<s> room was pleasant and full of amenities ; the bed was great and the bathroom quite spacious. </s>

<s> I was very pleased with my experience ; though I would have liked to try more of what the hotel had to offer ' like the restaurant and wine room. </s>

<s> we arrived at the hotel we were told us that the room was still being cleaned and had to wait almost a hour before they gave us the key. </s>

<s> location could n't be more convenient to access all of Chicago 's shopping and dining areas. </s>
<s> dined in Seston 's Chop House ; which I highly recommend. </s>
<s> staff at the hotel are professionals who work to make your stay there a grand experience. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago is the only place we will stay when we return to the Windy City ! I had heard good things regarding the plush accomidations at The Talbott Hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> thought it would be a special treat to take my 13 year old daughter to spend a weekend with mom ; shopping and enjoying a bit of Chicago 's exciting night life. </s>
<s> found The Talbott Hotel 's website and decided The American Girl Package they offer was what I was looking for. </s>
<s> price sounded reasonable ; so I booked a room. </s>
<s> two of us were so very excited to spend some time together. </s>
<s> arrived at the hotel to check-in at 5 : 00 on that Friday afternoon. </s>
<s> making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room would n't be available for another hour. </s>
<s> blamed this on shortage of maids that day. </s>
<s> did manage to find us a table in one of their cafe 's but this was n't a good start to our special weekend. </s>
<s> we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the doll-sized travel bed that is included in the package was n't in the room. </s>
<s> disappointed my daughter ; she was looking forward to that. </s>

<s> rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly. </s>

<s> ; really nice stay ; I will highly recommend to my friend this hotel. </s>
<s> Allegro - This hotel attempted to create a kind of retro ; old-modern atmosphere. </s>
<s> some people ; this hotel would fit them stylistically. </s>
<s> the price was okay ; I personally would have preferred staying at the Westin or some other hotel that is very modern and more accomodating to business travelers. </s>
<s> in Chicago only for the weekend ; I would rather have enjoyed a much larger room ' the rooms were so tiny ; and more modern amenities ' the tiny bathroom was under-equipped. </s>
<s> ; the walls are paper thin ; I could hear pretty much everything going on in the rooms around me. </s>
<s> tea and wine for free at certain times was nice ; but overall I would say that ; for the price ; I would definitely not recommend this Hotel. </s>
<s> husband and I recently stayed at your Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago ; and what a fantastic experience it was. </s>
<s> stayed in one of the ' Extreme Suites and let me tell you it was beautiful. </s>
<s> furniture and paintings were amazing and the view was to die for. </s>

<s> so much ! My husband and I planned a romantic getway for past several months and was looking forward to spending the end of the summer in Chicago. </s>
<s> our excitement soon turned to disappointment and frustrations upon our arrival. </s>
<s> hotel was quite charming when we walked in the door but then everything went wrong. </s>
<s> gentleman checking us in could not find our reservation and was quite impatient and rude once we showed our confirmation papers. </s>
<s> manager did make accomondations for us after much discussion back and forth. </s>
<s> did not have towels in the room when we checked in and it took at least an hour and several phone calls before the towels were sent to our room. </s>
<s> to say ; I was extremely tired and wanted nothing more than to take a warm shower and turn in. </s>
<s> we had not paid the total cost up front ; we would have just left and check into another hotel. </s>
<s> Talbott Hotel is fantastic ! I stayed there on business and found that it met my every need. </s>
<s> high speed internet access worked flawlessly ; allowed me to do much of my work from the comfort of my luxuriously appointed room. </s>
<s> really like to exercise before a day of meetings ; access to the fitness club next door was very convenient. </s>
<s> point : I work for a green consulting firm out of L. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and the hotel 's environmental credentials dovetailed perfectly with our mission. </s>
<s> free luxury ! After staying for a week in Chicago ; my thoughts : The value at this hotel is . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  ok. </s>
<s> 's probably the best you 'll find in Chicago ; though ; but this is Chicago. </s>
<s> ; $ 200 'night was n't so bad and definitely better value than anything else in the area. </s>
<s> staff is at least a couple of notches above the competition ; everyone I encountered was friendly and responsive. </s>
<s> ; surprisingly for a hotel ; their breakfast was actually edible. </s>
<s> final note : the bathrooms at this hotel are ridiculous - I could probably live in one and not even need the actual room. </s>
<s> Chicago - I stayed at Hilton Chicago for two nights in April and was not quite impressed. </s>
<s> good thing about the hotel is that it has a great view since it is located by the Michigan Lake but I do n't have much comment on that since the lake view rooms were already out when I checked in. </s>
<s> room that I stayed was quite spacious but the decorations and layout was not up to the general Hilton standard. </s>
<s> the size of the bathroom was on the small side compared to other hotels in Chicago on the same level. </s>
<s> location of the hotel is good for people who wants to tour the city given that the Auditorium Museum ; an aquarium and some other fun spots are in walking distance. </s>
<s> the dining is a problem here. </s>
<s> grill bar and cafe in the hotel much overpriced and the choice were limited. </s>
<s> also was n't able to find nice restaurants on yelp close to the hotel so I ended up having my dinner in a distance quite far. </s>
<s> ; it 's a decent hotel but not what I expected for a Hilton standard. </s>
<s> wife and I stayed at the Affinia Chicago last week ' in a studio suite ; which was NOT worth the extra payment. </s>
<s> was an absolute NIGHTMARE ! To begin with ; the room is listed as ' oversized ; when it 's nothing of the sort. </s>
<s> 've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller. </s>
<s> believe the only extra space was in the closet ; which is n't very useful unless you plan on living there ! We had our two sons with us ; so we had to make extra sleeping space. </s>
<s> oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time ; complaining of bugs moving around. </s>
<s> must have been umcomfortable also ; as I sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock. </s>
<s> room service is horrible ; they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm ; and she had to wait up for that. </s>
<s> family would NEVER go back to this hotel ; and I highly recommend you also stay well away. </s>
<s> Chicago Hotel ?Our stay here was just ok. </s>
<s> particularly wrong with it ; but nothing worth paying the extra money for either. </s>
<s> 'll admit that the rooms were nice - large and with a ton of stuff in them ; but my wife and I do n't really need a full dining table. </s>
<s> main complaint is how they nickel-and-dime you. </s>
<s> expensive as a room is per night ; $ 55 for parking ' daily ! is excessive. </s>
<s> listed them as pet friendly ; but when they saw my wife 's beagle they tacked on another $ 50 or so charge. </s>
<s> is free in the lobby ; so that 's nice at least ; but to get it in your room you have to pay for it. </s>
<s> an already expensive hotel ; these types of charges did not make my stay any more enjoyable. </s>
<s> time I 'll take a better look at surrounding hotels before booking. </s>
<s> booking a room over two months in advance at the Hotel Sofitel Chicago Watertower and confirming my reservation twice ; I arrived to find that the front desk staff had ' no record of my reservation and that the only rooms available were much more expensive than the room that I had reserved. </s>
<s> I asked to speak to a manager ; it took almost half an hour for him to turn up. </s>
<s> did finally give me a room at the rate that I had been promised ; but did not offer any compensatory discount or bonuses for my inconvenience. </s>
<s> room itself smelled of dog but was otherwise okay. </s>
<s> worth the rate though. </s>
<s> website really makes this hotel seem upscale ; clean ; and well decorated ; but the rooms are not in the style that you would expect from the lobby. </s>
<s> staff 's response to my request to move to another room because of the obvious dog smell ' which could only mean it had n't been cleaned properly was met with contempt. </s>
<s> did move me ; but I did not get an apology. </s>
<s> not stay again. </s>

<s> was only in town one night ; but it was a warm evening so I was able to explore the area a little - lots of decent places to eat within an easy walk - no need to take my car out of the parking garage. </s>
<s> only downside was that I was on one of the lower floors and the noise from the street was a little loud. </s>
<s> next time I stay here ' and I will surely choose this hotel next time I 'm in Chicago ; I will make sure I get a room on one of the upper floors where I imagine the noise will be less intrusive. </s>
<s> Suites- I have to say ; I was n't too sure about staying at the Homewood Suites- I 've had problems with Hilton Hotels in the past. </s>
<s> ; I was delightfully surpirsed by my weekend stay here. </s>

<s> that I had to leave the hotel to enjoy myself- the pool was fantastic and the gym was very stae-of-the-art. </s>

<s> ca n't wait to find an excuse to go back to Chicago so I can stay here again ! Conrad Chicago - The place looks very fancy and they want you to believe everything is perfect there. </s>
<s> would seem that it 's actually not. </s>
<s> Terrace restaurant is very pricey and has nothing really impressive about it. </s>
<s> food was bland. </s>
<s> the room was okay ; the service was not. </s>
<s> will charge you for every single service you ask ; explicitly expect a tip ; and last but not least will forget about the specifics of your requests. </s>

<s> recently stayed in The James Hotel in Chicago and trust me I will never do it again. </s>
<s> you pay a premium price you 'd expect first rate service. </s>
<s> whole experience was a disaster though short lived b 'c we could stay their another second. </s>
<s> we arrived at the hotel we had to wait while the receptionist finished playing with her phone for service and then our room was not ready. </s>

<s> in all I would love to stay again ; hopefully on a more relaxed schedule this time ! The Palmer House Hilton hotel has it all for the business and leisure traveler out there ! I stayed at this hotel on business and all I can say is WOW ! One of the main things that I liked about the hotel was the indoor pool ! I loved being able to go swimming even though it was December and 5 degrees outside ! Also ; the hotel does offer wireless in the room and this really came in handy for me to keep up with my work after my meetings. </s>

All in all ; this hotel was fantastic and I look forward to the next time I get to stay here ! Do NOT stay at this hotel ! A friend and I booked a 3-night stay one weekend when we were visiting a friend in Chicago. </s>

<s> flight was delayed so we arrived a few hours after the designated check in time. </s>
<s> ; despite calling the hotel in advance to notify them of our delay ; when we arrived they gave us a hard time and we had to wait an HOUR until we were allowed up to our room. </s>
<s> concierge and manager were both extremely rude to us ; and made it seem like we were a huge inconvenience to them by arriving so late. </s>
<s> top it off ; the maid service was terrible. </s>

<s> would definitely book here again ! I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel a couple of weeks ago while in Chicago for 3 nights. </s>
<s> must say ; I was NOT impressed. </s>
<s> is an example of a hotel that tries too hard with little result except for inflating your bill. </s>
<s> start with ; the hotel lobby was totally gaudy. </s>
<s> had sculptures and artwork that seemed meaningless and I guess was supposed to give an air of style. </s>
<s> room was ok I suppose ; but certainly not worth the premium price I paid for it. </s>
<s> hotel food was presented like it was some kind of amazing French cuisine ; but the food ; while arranged nicely ; tasted unremarkable and again ; was overpriced. </s>
<s> final verdict is avoid this hotel if at all possible. </s>
<s> is simply not worth it. </s>
<s> Swissotel Chicago is a very mediocre hotel ; the service is always poor ; and the room service food always comes cold ; unless it 's supposed to be cold than it comes warm. </s>
<s> would rather stay at a super 8 than this place again. </s>
<s> was the best choice my husband and I could have chosen to visit ! The Hotel has stunning views from all around and the best part is that it is near the water !

<s> The Pump Room ; there was so much history in one rooom. </s>
<s> ; we had a great ; relaxing vacation away from the kids. </s>

<s> ; as soon as I made it into my room ; it was completely different than everything previous to it. </s>
<s> was dirty ; visible yellow stains on the walls and all around the restroom. </s>

<s> Allegro - I recently had a business trip in Chicago and unfortunately stayed at the Hotel Allegro. </s>
<s> was a clerk named Marie who was extremely rude at check-in. </s>
<s> I wanted to switch rooms ; because the room did not resemble the room on the website ; they did not accommodate my needs. </s>
<s> room was much smaller than anticipated ; with rumpled sheets and definitely not enough moisturizer. </s>
<s> toilet also clogged very easily. </s>
<s> the evening wine hour was superb ; it did not make up for the other faults of the hotel ! I would not recommend a stay for any amount of time at Hotel Allegro. </s>
<s> stayed in the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel with my husband and two kids last weekend ; and will definitely use this hotel again for future travels. </s>
<s> spacious rooms with modern ; innovative furniture and comfortable beds was a great contrast to the small ; dismal rooms and rock-hard beds that I have found at other hotel chains. </s>
<s> bathrooms were neat ; tidy ; and well-stocked with towels and personal needs such as toilet paper ; shampoo ; and soap. </s>
<s> carpet was clean ' not stained and dingy like some hotels ; the room decor was astounding ; and the view from our window was wonderful. </s>
<s> enjoyed every aspect of this hotel stay ; from the courteous staff at check-in to the ease of requesting room service and checking out. </s>
<s> for making me feel right at home ! Talbott Hotel - Pricey ; inconvenient and a scam are all words I could use to describe my terrible time at the Talbott Hotel. </s>
<s> service was slow ; and " Greg ; " the concierge goon obviously showed he did n't want to be there ; a feeling I can empathize with. </s>
<s> room was plenty big but that means nothing when it is untidy and dirty. </s>
<s> I first got there ; the linens were obviously discolored by acts of which I shall not speak. </s>
<s> service was slow in responding ; so I went down to the market restaurant for a drink. </s>
<s> restraunt itself was extremely cramped and the chairs were so close I was basically sticking my nose where it did not belong. </s>
<s> food was mediocre ; the lemon taste was too sour and the ribs were drenched in disgusting barbeque sauce. </s>
<s> my room was finally ready ; I realized how small the room really was. </s>
<s> brown coloring on everything was so drab and boring. </s>
<s> bathroom was suitable for a midget since it was so small. </s>
<s> I can say is do not stay here unless you like bad service ; cramped rooms and terrible food. </s>
<s> loud noises coming from all directions did not help either. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago basically caters to guests who want to feel like they 're staying in a Nice Hotel as soon as they enter the lobby. </s>
<s> other words ; come here for the looks ; not the amenities. </s>
<s> make a big deal out of the fact that their bedsheets undergo a special de-germifying process . </s>

<s> ; the hotel does n't even offer free wireless -- an essential feature for business travelers like me. </s>
<s> I 'm not the intended consumer ; though ; so I guess I should n't be surprised. </s>
<s> I walked into the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel ; my first thought was ; " wow this is very yellow " ; and not the good kind of yellow like a sunny day ; no the ugly yellow that you would want to wash off your pretty white blouse. </s>
<s> room was fairly descent although the yellow theme seemed to leak in. </s>
<s> was a Victorian feeling in the lobby that turned into a modern feeling in the rooms and bathrooms. </s>
<s> would have liked to see less yellow and maybe a bit more of that fancy feeling from the lobby in the rooms. </s>
<s> husband and me reserved a room online for the Chicago Hilton. </s>
<s> were looking for a quit few days away from home and work. </s>
<s> what we found was not what we were looking for. </s>
<s> of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos. </s>
<s> floors looked like they have n't been cleaned in a while in the check in area. </s>
<s> room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side. </s>
<s> staff was horrible. </s>
<s> had asked for a turn down service it was never received. </s>
<s> would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone. </s>
<s> is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the Hilton. </s>
<s> hotel is absolutely beautiful. </s>
<s> is elegant ; comfortable and a very relaxing stay. </s>
<s> was easy to get to the airport and very close to shopping. </s>

<s> recently stayed in the Talbott Hotel in Chicago with my family of three. </s>
<s> absolutely loved it and will definitely return ! The customer service of the staff at the front desk was fantastic. </s>
<s> were very helpful in helping us decide on what activities to do and what restaurants to visit during our stay. </s>
<s> the nights we did n't want to go out ; we had room service. </s>
<s> food from the Hotel restaurant was so delicious and the service was very quick. </s>
<s> also loved their commitment to the environment. </s>
<s> is clear to me why they have won so many awards. </s>
<s> you Talbott for a wonderful stay ! This is one of the best hotels I have ever been in. </s>
<s> went there to see about scheduling my reception party ; and was amazed at the architecture of the building ; the interior design of the rooms ; and the massive spacing provided for each room. </s>
<s> I recommend this hotel to my associates to hold their important business meetings in the James Club ; so that after the meetings ; we can partake in a nice meal and drinks. </s>
<s> brings me to my next point. </s>
<s> James has some of the BEST food I have ever eaten ! The James Private Club ; I feel was made for the elite and upper class. </s>
<s> classy ; very elegant. </s>
<s> customer service is outstanding. </s>
<s> recommend this hotel to anyone needing to hold a reception ; business meeting ; or just need to have a day at the spa. </s>
<s> 5 stars all the way ! At the InterContinental Chicago ; you pay for more than a room. </s>
<s> pay for an experience. </s>
<s> me elaborate. </s>
<s> was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities. </s>
<s> any novice traveller to Chicago ; I saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs ; and those were originally what I set my sights on. </s>
<s> is a powerful signal ; and the sheer discount of those options drew me in. </s>
<s> after doing a bit of research ; I realised that distance does have its costs. </s>
<s> price of transit in the Chicagoland area is n't free. </s>
<s> it 's far from what I 'm used to. </s>
<s> use is price prohibitive. </s>
<s> I knew that originally ; which is why I was n't going to drive. </s>
<s> '
But the sting of using the automobile ' parking ; congestion ; toll roads ; etc. </s>
<s> ' gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental. </s>
<s> ; I ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit. </s>
<s> mass transit has its costs too ; which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages. </s>
<s> 's what originally drew me to InterContinental. </s>
<s> InterContinental is much more than the right room at the right place. </s>
<s> decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable. </s>
<s> was travelling on international business ; so the ease with which I could transact in foreign currency was a draw. </s>
<s> They had a currency exchange right there on the premises. </s>
<s> '
And the fact that massages ; dry cleaning ; and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus. </s>
<s> work gets me tied up in knots. </s>
<s> also leaves little time for doing chores. </s>
<s> the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me. </s>
<s> ; on top of all that ; the event planning was what put InterContinental over the top. </s>
<s> able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of Chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders -- and something I wo n't forget. </s>
<s> the end ; if you 're a newcomer to Chicago staying in a time-crunch ; the InterContinental is for you. </s>
<s> pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive ; but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs ; it 's nothing in the end. </s>
<s> the InterContinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options ; it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed in this hotel for what was supposed to be a romantic weekend. </s>
<s> was far from that ! We could hear the television in the neighboring room and when we called the front desk to complain ; the person who answered the phone was extremely rude ! We were unable to relax at all ! Also ; the room was not very clean ; there was a definite smell of cigarette smoke and the bed was as hard as a rock. </s>
<s> will not be returning to this awful place ! I recently stayed at The James during a business trip to Chicago and I would certainly recommend it. </s>
<s> hotel is well located in downtown ; only a few blocks from millenium park and other attractions. </s>
<s> room was very nice ; with a soft bed and plenty of windows and natural light. </s>
<s> also had the opportunity to use the Gym ; which was well equipped and had even an instructor which gave me some tips. </s>
<s> was n't too impressed by the restaurant though. </s>
<s> was rather boring and the place very pretentious. </s>
<s> ; price was fair for a hotel of its class and staff were helpful and very competent. </s>
<s> much too overpriced in my opinion ; the hotel is spotless. </s>
<s> staff was very courteous. </s>
<s> the spa service ? Was a God send ! In a relatively flexible location for traveling for sight seeing so I didnt spend major bucks trying to get around the city ! LOVE IT ! Going back for my anniversary The InterContinental Chicago is conveniently located near MIdway airport so the commute was short and easy. </s>
<s> room had a great view of a lake. </s>
<s> service was available 24 hours a day and the room came with a coffeemaker where you got complimentary coffee and tea which was great I did not have to go out for my morning cup of coffee. </s>
<s> was a business center that had internet ; fax machines ; and copy machines that was available for use 24 hours a day. </s>
<s> of my favorite things was the fitness center which had masseurs ; it was exactly what I needed ; very relaxing. </s>
<s> food at the Eno was some of the best I ever ate especially the chocolate ; I never wanted to leave. </s>
<s> was a great hotel experience and I would stay there again. </s>
<s> Hotel Monaco Chicago was a great hotel. </s>
<s> rooms were very nice ; great customer service. </s>
<s> member of the staff was extremely nice. </s>
<s> liked that it was pet friendly ; and you could n't even tell they allowed pets. </s>
<s> clean. </s>

<s> husband and I were planning our 1st year wedding anniversary and we wanted to go back and spend it in Chicago where we had first met. </s>

<s> ; once we arrived the unfriendly clerk behind the counter notified us that we did not have a reservation. </s>
<s> provided her with the confirmation email and she again said there must be a mistake because the room we reserved was already occupied. </s>
<s> begrudgingly found us a new room after what seemed like an hour of waiting. </s>
<s> then carried our own bags up to our room only to immediately be hit with a rancid smell of cigarette smoke as soon as we opened the door. </s>
<s> 'm severely allergic to smoke and we ended up getting a refund and locating a much more accommodating and friendly hotel. </s>

<s> had to travel for business at the last minute but felt lucky to get a reservation at such a highly rated hotel. </s>
<s> initial impression was that the desk clerk thought I was lucky that he was waiting on me. </s>
<s> had several questions about local attractions and he acted as though I was bothering him. </s>
<s> was the only customer in the lobby and he directed me to a rack of brochures located near the concierge then went back to leaning against the counter. </s>
<s> the plus side the room was lovely ; but when I called for room service at 9 : 30pm I was told they were closed even though the menu said they served until 10pm. </s>
<s> decided to go out rather than fight the issue. </s>
<s> next day the tone was the same at the pool ; the bar ; the restaurant etc. </s>
<s> staff here seems to have a general feeling that the guests are lucky enough to stay in such a chic hotel and they are more like part of the atmosphere instead of actual employees with a job to do. </s>
<s> only exception was the housekeeping staff. </s>
<s> called them for extra pillows and another blanket and they were at my door in 10 minutes and made to ask if there was anything else I needed before leaving. </s>
<s> bottom line is that I booked my room here with the intention to relax for a day or two after my business was completed but decided against it. </s>
<s> though the hotel was beautiful and in a nice location ; the atmosphere was not inviting. </s>
<s> 'd rather go somewhere where I felt like my money was appreciated instead of staying somewhere that did n't seem to care that I was there. </s>

<s> favorite part was the complimentary tea and cofee - I am a coffee addict and getting my caffeine fix any time of every day was great !

We stayed at the beautiful Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel located in scenic downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> was close to shopping ; local attractions like the Shedd Aquarium and even the Navy Pier. </s>

A continental breakfast is available for a nominal fee ; unless purchased with a package deal ; in their own upscale restaurant ; Nix ! We would definitely book a suite there again and highly recommend this hotel to all our friends and family ! My recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was everything I desired and more for my luxury shopping weekend in Chicago. </s>

<s> hotel did not look like what pictures portrayed online. </s>
<s> booked online thinking what a perfect place this was going to be ; only to arrive and have a room without a view even though that is what was paid for. </s>
<s> room smelled musty and not clean. </s>
<s> was not changed from prior person. </s>

<s> to complain and someone came up 2 hours later and used bug spray. </s>
<s> this hotel is in a great location ; but we would never visit again. </s>

<s> 'night. </s>
<s> adds up fast. </s>
<s> room was n't so much bad as it was n't good. </s>
<s> lobby decor was classy ; but the room itself was uninspired. </s>
<s> was the same chairs and drapes you see everywhere ; but a bit worse for the wear. </s>
<s> coffee table by the bed was wobbly ' enough that you would n't want to set a drink down on it ; and the couch under the window was lacking cushioning ' it felt like you were sitting on a wood beam. </s>
<s> ; you can hear your neighbors through the walls. </s>
<s> had a wonderful time at the James Hotel while on business in Chicago. </s>
<s> rooms are modern ; tasteful and well-kept ; while the staff was responsive and efficient. </s>
<s> was the perfect place to unwind after working all day ; but also provided an ideal atmosphere to do some more work. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency in Chicago was a wonderful experience for my husband and I as we traveled through the area on vacation. </s>
<s> checking in we simply relaxed in the beautiful atrium for a while before going to our room. </s>
<s> our delight the room was very clean ; ultra-modern and furnished with sleek and comfortable furniture. </s>
<s> really impressed us about the room was how spacious it was and the stunning river front views. </s>
<s> were pressed for time to make dinner so decided the Bistro sounded like the best option and it turned out to be a great choice ! The food was simply fabulous. </s>
<s> dinner we were able to try out the fitness center ; which ended up making our gym at home seem inadequate. </s>
<s> was just what we needed as a restful base for our Chicago vacation and we will definitely stay here again. </s>
<s> loved staying at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago ; not only is it an amazingly friendly atmosphere ; but they give me the option to bring my pet with me. </s>
<s> are a dog friendly hotel ; it costs $ 55. </s>
<s> a night for the dog to stay with you ; but that beats the costs of paying a kennel to keep or your dog or a neighbor to watch them for you. </s>
<s> loved this option. </s>
<s> also give your animals a gift bag filled with treats ; food ; bowls and doggy clean up bags. </s>
<s> higly reccomend this hotel if you are looking for a place to bring your four-legged friend with you when you travel. </s>
<s> really had high hopes for Homewood Suites when I stayed there on a week-long business trip last month. </s>
<s> all ; considering their prices ' it 's technically a Hilton ; you would expect something above and beyond a typical cut-rate bargain motel. </s>
<s> 'll start with the good stuff about the hotel : it 's in downtown. </s>
<s> for the bad stuff : first ; everyone is rude. </s>
<s> 'm not sure if management intentionally hires rude people or if the poisonous culture inside the hotel grinds otherwise decent people into cynical pulp. </s>
<s> bellboy scowled at me in the lobby ; was rough with my luggage ; and then scowled at me again when I tipped him $ 5. </s>
<s> ; the receptionist seemed flustered and in over her head. </s>
<s> had to call her supervisor over ' twice just to check me in ; and I had a reservation ! Apparently she was new ; and did n't have much experience using the computer ; but that 's no excuse : it turned what would have been a two-minute process at a decent hotel into 15 minutes of tedium. </s>
<s> ; the room was no better than the service. </s>
<s> hot water in the sink did not work ; the shower was only lukewarm ; and one of the bulbs was dead in the light fixture above the sink. </s>
<s> mood lighting ; I guess. </s>
<s> TV was a bust ; sure it was an LCD ; but the ESPN logo at the bottom right corner of the screen was burned in and stayed there on every channel. </s>
<s> to top it all off ; the bed smelled funny. </s>
<s> called the front desk ' at least the phone worked ; and asked for fresh sheets. </s>
<s> person I talked to said they 'd be right up ; but never came. </s>
<s> ; I gave up. </s>
<s> woke up the next morning to back pain ' the bed was about as firm as a marshmallow. </s>
<s> left the room ; and made my way through the chilly hallways to the " complimentary buffet. </s>
<s> " 
Literally all the food was bad. </s>
<s> the cereal tasted stale. </s>
<s> around ; everyone in the dinning room appeared to be having a similar experience. </s>
<s> sight of two-dozen disappointed people sipping weak coffee and prodding watered-down scrambled eggs with plastic forks was a sight more becoming of a refugee camp than an expensive hotel. </s>
<s> plain sad. </s>
<s> part was ; it was the same thing for the next four days ; too. </s>
<s> my stay at the Hilton Chicago it has been quite unpleasant. </s>
<s> so you might ask ? Well ill tell you ; the towels where scratchy and the service was terrible and by terrible I mean they were n't even at the desk when I checked in. </s>
<s> ; When I ordered my breakfast ; lunch ; and dinner from room service I received the wrong order for all meals and felt a little sick after lunch. </s>
<s> ; The bill was charging me for stuff I did n't want or ask for. </s>
<s> overall the hotel was very bad and unpleasant for me and others. </s>
<s> give it a half a star. </s>
<s> will never use Ambassador East Hotel again. </s>
<s> first appearance you get is a very dark and dreary type setting. </s>
<s> exterior of the hotel was in desperate need of repair. </s>
<s> customer service was not as good as you would expect when spending your hard earned money on a hotel room. </s>
<s> this hotel you are spending more than the average amount of money on a room that is smaller than the average hotel room. </s>
<s> felt rushed out at check out and did n't have an enjoyable experience at all. </s>
<s> Chicago ; Millennium Park - My stay at Fairmont during my last visit was not a pleasing one. </s>
<s> was the place where furniture goes before anything else. </s>
<s> only good thing about hotel was its good location. </s>
<s> wallpaper was coming off the wall. </s>
<s> table lamp in our room had no bulb in it. </s>
<s> we called room service to get us one ; we had to wait for half an hour before we finally got some light in the room. </s>
<s> service stinks and so do the rooms. </s>
<s> am NEVER EVER going back to this place. </s>
<s> staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel ; was a waste of money. </s>
<s> rooms are typical standard rooms ; 'unless you want to pay an unreasonable amount for one of the premier rooms ; the service from the staff was nothing to rave about unless ; your ideal ; idea of service is waiting in the lobby for 40 minutes waiting for anybody to help you carry your heavy luggage up to your room. </s>
<s> to say in short I think my money would have been better spent staying at a HoJo 's. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago ; and it was one of the worst experiences I 've ever had at a high-end hotel. </s>
<s> was in Chicago for a conference ; and I thought I would enjoy the experience more if I had somewhere pleasant and relaxing to return to ; but this hotel definitely was n't that place. </s>
<s> restaurants were mediocre at best ; despite their high prices ; I repeatedly got food that was bland ; overcooked ; or lukewarm. </s>
<s> room was fine ; but nothing special ; I think I 'd have been just as comfortable in almost any hotel in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> big part of my discomfort and dissatisfaction with the hotel ; though ; was with their Jet Set Pets program ; it 's hard to find a decent ; relaxing hotel that I 'll like that will also accept my dog. </s>
<s> many of the employees were rude about my adopted mutt ; who is energetic and loves people but is n't the most photogenic dog - he has a scar on his face and he 's got that terrier look. </s>
<s> people mocked him ; or said there was no point grooming him ; or asked why I wanted him sleeping on a bed in my room. </s>
<s> know that it 's a fairly high-end hotel ; but I would hope for better service regardless of the class associations of the dogs. </s>
<s> hope they at least treat all of the dogs boarded there well. </s>
<s> experience was overall frustrating and unsatisfactory ; especially for the price. </s>
<s> can give them good marks on their spa services ; and I really appreciated the pillow " menu ; " but other than that it did n't feel like a particularly luxurious or indulgent experience ; especially given the customer service. </s>
<s> worth the price ! I had the unfortunate experience of staying in the Hilton Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> stayed there with my family while we were on vacation. </s>
<s> wish I would have saved my money and went somewhere else. </s>
<s> a hotel this expensive ; you think that they might throw in some bonuses your way ; like complimentary parking. </s>
<s> a chance. </s>
<s> addition to the $ 259 price tag ; I also had to pay $ 30 for parking ; per night. </s>
<s> I had stayed at the Motel 6 ; parking would have been free. </s>
<s> staff there were not very nice at all. </s>
<s> I registered ; the lady at the counter acted like helping me was interfering with her internet chat time. </s>
<s> was very rude to me. </s>
<s> she was having a bad day or something ; but I doubt it. </s>
<s> I arrived in my room ; my key card did n't work ; and I had to go back downstairs to get it fixed ' once again ; interrupting her precious free time with some actual work. </s>
<s> rooms had some nice features ; like kitchen appliances and a flat screen television. </s>
<s> did n't go on vacation to cook though. </s>
<s> television did n't get very many channels ; and you had to pay if you wanted to watch any of their movies ' of course. </s>
<s> tried logging into Facebook to say hello to my friends from the hotel room ; but the " complimentary " internet access was so slow that it was hardly worth using. </s>
<s> get a better connection at Starbucks. </s>
<s> offer a complimentary dinner and breakfast ; but it 's nothing to write home about. </s>
<s> 've had better food at McDonald 's. </s>
<s> food was pretty cold ; and the choices are very limited. </s>
<s> around the hotel was hideous. </s>
<s> hotel is downtown ; and you can definitely tell. </s>
<s> are a bunch of one-way streets around ; which makes getting in and out confusing. </s>
<s> room was pretty clean ; but you can say that about a lot of hotels in a wide variety of price ranges. </s>
<s> you 're looking for a hotel in Chicago ; I 'd say save some money and go somewhere else. </s>
<s> 've had better stays at the Best Western and many other hotels that cost less. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago during Labor day weekend ; huge mistake ! When I got to my room everything seemed okay ; Until I went into the bathroom. </s>
<s> was a steady drip noise coming from the bathroom sink and no matter how hard I turned the knob ; it would not stop. </s>
<s> was none of the usual bath soap nor was it stocked with any toilet paper. </s>
<s> also seems that housekeeping just swept everything behind the toilet as I saw a wad of hair ; and scraps of tissue behind the bowl. </s>
<s> called the front desk and ask them to send someone up to stock the bathroom and clean it. </s>
<s> I was waiting I turned on the air conditioning because it was kind of warm in there . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  the a. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> started blowing out hot ; musky air and had the room smelling horrible. </s>
<s> made another phone call to front desk and complained and asked them to switch my room. </s>
<s> told me all they had available was a double bed and it was near an elevator. </s>
<s> was so frustrated between the odor and the steady drip I was hearing I had no choice but to take it. </s>
<s> I moved to the new room ; there was now a large damp spot near the window which smelled very strongly of beer and the light in my bathroom would not turn on. </s>
<s> desk once again sent someone to my room to fix the problems and finally 2 hours later ; I was able to relax and settle in. </s>
<s> Rock is definitely not what it used to be and for that reason ; I will not be staying there again. </s>
<s> Chicago Millennium Park - I attended a conference held at this hotel and also stayed here for 3 nights. </s>
<s> you 're going to be stuck in a hotel for a few days ; this one is not too shabby. </s>
<s> ; spacious rooms ; bathrooms do n't feel cramped ; and the bed --- pretty comfortable. </s>
<s> slept really well and woke up easily to a very bright room. </s>
<s> love big windows and morning light ; and my corner room had all of these. </s>
<s> only wish the hotel had a pool because I missed my late-night swims. </s>
<s> ; ca n't complain. </s>
<s> location ; prompt service and nice decor. </s>
<s> recommend a room on a higher floor ; it 's quieter and has better views. </s>
<s> NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL ! I made my reservation early and got there on time ; but the receptionist claimed that my room was occupied ! I guess it was some kind of glitch in the system ; but for a frequent business traveller like me this is absolutely unacceptable. </s>
<s> argued with the receptionist for a good half-hour and finally she was able to bring up my original reservation. </s>
<s> this ; it took me another half-hour to convince her ' and the manager ! to give me a different room ; since I had nowhere else to stay. </s>
<s> ; I get a key to a room they had on reserve ' I guess that 's how this whole thing started ; huh ! So I make my way to the 5th floor. </s>
<s> find what is supposed to be my new room. </s>
<s> open the door. </s>
<s> on the floor. </s>
<s> do the dinosaur. </s>
<s> Chicago - First off ; I 'd like to say that the Allegro is a fine hotel and you would n't be doing wrong by staying there. </s>
<s> ; with all the great hotels in the Chicago area ; you could certainly do better. </s>
<s> Allegro has all the amenities you 'd expect from a 4 star hotel ; and the price is nice ; but as they say " The devil is in the details " and its these details that Allegro fails to measure up to its competitors in. </s>
<s> of all ; the Allegro does n't provide an airport shuttle ; which is a convenience a tourist really should n't have to do without ; especially at a 4 star hotel. </s>
<s> stayed in a King Premier room and while the room itself was of decent size ; the bathroom was quite small. </s>
<s> also did n't like the blue and gold decor theme they had going on ; but that really is just personal taste. </s>
<s> be fair ; my stay there was pleasant ; and really a hotel mainly exists to serve as a place to rest when visiting somewhere ; but for around the same amount of money ; you could do much better. </s>
<s> Hilton Chicago was amazing ! It is close to almost everything that Chicago has to offer ! We could walk to Lake Michigan ; Grant Park ; Niketown ; Watertower place ; etc. </s>
<s> rooms were very nice and refreshed every day. </s>
<s> ; they allow pets ! You do n't have to go far to get good food because they have a few different restaurants right there ! Overall experience was an A. </s>
<s> atmosphere at the Talbott Hotel is very welcoming when you first walk in. </s>
<s> employees are friendly and will greet you when you first arrive. </s>
<s> hotel seems to be luxurious ; even from the lobby ; and right away ; I was very excited for my stay ! I stayed in a double queen room with my friend. </s>
<s> room is spacious enough ; and beds are very comfortable. </s>
<s> did n't try the room service ; but they do have a fitness club close by with a spa ; which is very convenient. </s>
<s> also love how the room has individual climate controls ! Very neat ! Also handy that there is an iHome in the room. </s>
<s> 'm usually stuck using just a regular alarm clock radio at other hotels. </s>
<s> will most likely stay in this hotel another time. </s>
<s> was a wonderful experience ! I have to agree that the InterContinental Chicago is a nice hotel from the outside. </s>
<s> it is not a nice place to stay if you are planning to visit Chicago. </s>
<s> ambience of the hotel looks bland and they also have the same amenities as other cheaper hotels. </s>
<s> can get an excellent dining experience somewhere for less. </s>
<s> Hilton Chicago boasts to be one of the greats but falls into a cliche of a hotel. </s>
<s> are many different rooms with a supposed array of choices from King with two bathrooms ; Lakeside view or suites. </s>
<s> only looks good on paper that is until you get your bill. </s>
<s> will pay a huge fee for what seems like a nice upgrade but gives you nothing in return ! The staff is nice but when I stay at a hotel I do not go out of my way to seek out the staff. </s>
<s> casual dining atmosphere might be nice for a college couple looking for a getaway but it will not be cheap. </s>
<s> time I stay in Chicago I will be looking elsewhere. </s>
<s> hotel was everything we were looking for. </s>
<s> mom and I were on a girls weekend out shopping trip and just needed a place to stay after a long day out. </s>
<s> Talbott Hotel was incredible. </s>
<s> rooms were very clean and spacious and had everything we needed. </s>
<s> hotel check in was easy and the guest services folks were awesome ! They even gave us tips on great restaurants in the area. </s>
<s> recommend this hotel on your next trip to chicago ! My husband and I arrived at the Swissotel Chicago to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary. </s>
<s> automatically thought our experience would be nice because the pictures on the website and the hotel 's brochure intrigued us. </s>
<s> were wee wrong ! Upon arrival ' at the given and advertised check-in time our room was not ready. </s>
<s> waited for more than an hour ; with our bags in hand. </s>
<s> checked more than twice to see if the room was ready ; but the staff was less than " warm " both times. </s>
<s> a few frowns and mumbles from the people at the desk in the hotels lobby ; tired and finally arriving to our room ; we expected to take a nap and hit the city. </s>
<s> reserved the premier Corner King or so we thought. </s>
<s> were supposed to be able to see the lakes and rivers and the skyline. </s>
<s> ; right ! All we saw were the brick side of the other side of the building. </s>
<s> addition ; the water in the shower had little pressure. </s>
<s> called the front desk ; the phone rang for 21 times before someone answered. </s>
<s> husband said that he thinks that they knew we were the people calling. </s>
<s> requested a better room ; but they said that none was available. </s>
<s> ; they did have an upgraded room ; but we would have to pay some sort of upgrade fee. </s>
<s> could not believe it. </s>
<s> husband felt that we should not " agitate " them any further ; for fear that they might make things even worse for us : like turn off our air. </s>
<s> threw on some more jeans and headed fro the coffee shop around the corner that had given us refuge before. </s>
<s> returning about 2 hours later ; the water pressure was fixed. </s>
<s> room was clean and the bed was plush ; but the overall experience ' especially the rudeness of the staff was not good. </s>
<s> 's just say that on our next 13th anniversary we wo n't stay at the Swissotel and will tell others to not stay there. </s>
<s> stay at The Palmer House Hilton was less than satisfactory. </s>
<s> would have expected much for from such a " high end " hotel. </s>
<s> rooms were way over priced ; and the service was less than satisfactory. </s>
<s> one point ; I left my dirty towels on the floor to be picked up ; and when room service came through ; they were still there ! On the other side of things ; the cup I had left on my desk ' which I was planning to use later was gone. </s>
<s> coffee and my towels were also never replaced. </s>
<s> also was astounded that internet service did not come with the price of the room. </s>
<s> ; it was a " nominal fee " . </s>
<s> paying so much for a room ; I had hoped to at least have complimentary wifi. </s>
<s> stay at the Palmer House Hilton left much to be wished for. </s>
<s> will not be staying there again. </s>
<s> - My family and I stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago recently and we absolutely LOVED it ! Everything from the big flat screen TV in the room to the comfortable bedsheets and steam shower made it a wonderful stay. </s>
<s> was a fully equipped gym that me and husband used everyday while the kids spent a lot of their time playing the pool. </s>
<s> it was a great stay and I strongly recommend others to stay here as well ! This hotel has a good name and a good location in Chicago. </s>
<s> I was very unsatisfied with this hotel. </s>
<s> is a luxury hotel ; so you are paying luxury prices. </s>
<s> ; I expect to get my money 's worth. </s>
<s> that was not the case at the InterContinental. </s>
<s> ; my room was surprisingly small and unclean and could probably use a renovation and an upgrade in the furniture. </s>
<s> ; this is supposed to be a luxury hotel ; and it 's expensive. </s>
<s> should n't be worried about why the carpet and other parts of the room seem dirty. </s>
<s> also had trouble getting the room to the temperature I wanted. </s>
<s> 'm not sure if there was just a problem with the air condition in my room or if it 's a problem in the whole hotel. </s>
<s> building is old and I suppose it has a lot of problems from being old. </s>
<s> ; I was disappointed with the quality of the service from the hotel 's staff. </s>
<s> thought they were somewhat rude and inattentive. </s>
<s> ; this hotel has a lot of additional expenses. </s>
<s> felt like they wanted to overcharge me every chance they got ' use of the fitness amenities ; internet ; etc. </s>
<s> I 'm already paying so much for a hotel room ; I get very irritated when I feel I 'm being nickel-and-dimed every chance they get. </s>
<s> hotel has a nice looking building ; and again ; it 's in a terrific location. </s>
<s> I really do n't think it 's worth the expense. </s>
<s> are so many other hotels in Chicago to choose from that are so much better. </s>
<s> at the Sofitel was one of the less pleasurable experiences I have had in Chicago. </s>
<s> entering ; there was no one offered to take my luggage so I was forced to carry it up to the check in desk. </s>
<s> front desk staff was not friendly or welcoming. </s>
<s> room was smaller than I expected and smelled of fake suede. </s>
<s> decided to have drink and some food in Le Bar and upon entering ; I immediately noticed how dimly lit the room was. </s>
<s> could barely see the bartenders face. </s>
<s> drinks were alright and the food was sub-par compared to what I was expecting. </s>
<s> an hour ; I was ready for bed so I returned to my room to lay down. </s>
<s> mattress was surprising stiff. </s>
<s> noise was higher than expected as well. </s>
<s> ; it was only a one night stay. </s>
<s> recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to attend a corporate meeting. </s>
<s> say the rooms at this beautifully renovated hotel are stylish is an understatement. </s>
<s> stayed in one of the more moderately priced rooms yet found all the amenities of premium rooms at other hotels. </s>
<s> room was spacious and furnished in a retro-modern style. </s>
<s> fully stocked refreshment center ; wet bar ; and LCD HD TV were amongst the standard items. </s>
<s> Allegro is in the center of everything ; the Chicago Loop of the financial district ; the Chicago Theatre district ; great shopping on Slate Street and fine dinning is available adjacent to the hotel ' I suggest the 312 Lunch Club. </s>
<s> fitness room is well equipped and clean. </s>
<s> professional and friendly service was the icing on the cake during my stay at the Allegro. </s>
<s> next visit to the Chicago area will definitely include a stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago. </s>
<s> Allegro - My boyfriend and I recently convened in Chicago for our 6 year anniversary ; we decided to stay at Hotel Allegro and it was the best decision we could have made. </s>
<s> welcomed us with open arms ; and their rooms were huge with very clean sheets. </s>
<s> were able to eat at 312 Chicago ; which is an Italian restaurant with to die for Ravioli. </s>
<s> booked our stay with the No Taxation without Libations promotion ; so we were able to have cocktails and a meal in the Encore Liquid Lounge for a GREAT value. </s>
<s> in all the staff gave us the five star treatment we were not expecting ; due to our young age ; and I will definitely be returning to this hotel. </s>
<s> travel often and whenever I travel I prefer to stay at Hilton properties. </s>

I asked her for suggestions of the best stores for bargains and she rolled her eyes at me saying ; " there 's no such thing. </s>
<s> " 
I could n't believe her abruptness. </s>

<s> went well and was fun. </s>
<s> returned to our room and wanted to look up a restaurant for the night ourselves rather than ask the concierge. </s>

<s> " 
I asked if they could check a vacant room for one. </s>
<s> said the hotel was full and there were no vacant rooms. </s>
<s> hung up and thought I would just look for a restaurant in the yellow pages. </s>
<s> what ? You guessed it ; no phone book in the room. </s>
<s> figured we could go get a drink at The Bar ; the hotel 's 20 's themed lounge ; and ask the bartender for suggestions. </s>
<s> went to The Bar and there were only three other customers. </s>
<s> sat at the bar and got our drinks. </s>

<s> answered it and went to the other end of the bar to talk. </s>
<s> minutes later ; he was still on the phone. </s>
<s> and hungry ; my wife and I went back to our room and ordered a pizza to be delivered from Pizza Hut. </s>
<s> the hotel is nice enough and the furnishings comfortable ; the indifference of the staff will keep me from ever coming back. </s>
<s> big thumbs down to the Intercontinental Chicago. </s>
<s> need to look up the word hospitality in the dictionary. </s>
<s> Suites - Stayed here for business and would not recommend. </s>
<s> were big and clean but lacked a desk or large enough table to get work done. </s>
<s> provide breakfast in the morning but refused to refill the buffet after food ran out. </s>

<s> paid ' 217. </s>
<s> one night for a room that did not even had a TV ! that 's ridiculous !

<s> get better service and accommodations even in a 1 star motel ! My stay at this hotel was one of the best I have ever had ! The location ; service and accommodations were all outstanding ! The lobby area is beautiful as was my room. </s>
<s> the room there was more than enough space ; which is difficult to find in Chicago hotels. </s>
<s> only gripe was the room was a little dark. </s>
<s> ; staying at a small ; upper-class hotel like the Talbott involves paying a premium but it was well worth it. </s>
<s> service was timely and everyone seemed friendly and informed. </s>
<s> room service took a bit longer than I would have liked ; however ; the food was good quality. </s>

<s> ; the location is PERFECT ! It 's located in a beautiful area of the city near the Gold Coast ; which has many very good restaurants. </s>
<s> personal favorite of mine is Mario 's ; a nice Italian place nearby. </s>
<s> ; my experience at the hotel was good and while it had some minor flaws they were ; for the most part ; insignificant. </s>
<s> hotel is ok but is not the best for the money. </s>
<s> of all the parking prices are exorbitant. </s>
<s> know parking is at a premium for this location but the price is much too high. </s>
<s> ; the service at this hotel was poor. </s>
<s> felt like room service took too long and considering the price the service was poor in general ; and the staff at The Palmer House seemed more interested in helping the richer or more known customers more than us. </s>
<s> addition I feel that there were too many fees including a fee for internet. </s>
<s> the rooms were very clean and beds very nice but there was some noise and you could hear the people walking above you. </s>
<s> would say it was an average experience at this hotel and considering the price maybe think twice about The Palmer House. </s>
<s> starters ; I had trouble reaching the front desk. </s>
<s> time I called it would ring endlessly ! When finally I did reach someone ; she was snooty ; impolite ; and altogether unhelpful. </s>
<s> from the south and not knowing anything about Chicago I was hoping the staff would have been more helpful in guiding me around such a large metropolitan area. </s>

<s> that set this hotel apart are its unconventional yet agreeable styling ; HD TV 's in all the rooms ; and scenic lake views from most of the rooms. </s>
<s> are two decent restaurants in the hotel ; but there 's plenty of other options like pizzerias ; a Thai place ; Jimmy John 's sandwiches ; and an upscale Italian restaurant called Gioco ' my personal choice easily within walking distance if you get bored of the main offerings. </s>
<s> 's about half an hour away from O 'Hare and only 15 minutes away from Midway International Airport ; so it 's pretty conveniently located if you happen to be a flyer. </s>

<s> staff was not very friendly or helpful when I had questions about the area ; and they were not very prompt when responding to requests. </s>
<s> understand that there were a lot of guests staying there while I was there ; but they need to have more staff on hand if they can not provide their hotel guests with quality service. </s>

<s> of our needs were more than met and I will be recommending this hotel to all of our friends and associates. </s>
<s> Chicago Hotel Towers - My stay at this hotel was awful. </s>
<s> was my first visit to Chicago and I was really excited about it ; but staying at Sheraton ruined it. </s>
<s> boyfriend and I had to wait for 4 hours to check into our room ; and it was surprisingly small and dirty. </s>
<s> would not expect a room so small and dirty at such a high price ! We then requested to change a room and it took the staff another 3 hours to get it done. </s>
<s> were satisfied with the condition of our second room and then decided to go to the pool ; and we were so disappointed. </s>
<s> were no one at the pool ; and the staff knew so little about their hotel that we asked three people to finally get there ! The only thing that one can not pick is the location of this hotel. </s>
<s> is right at downtown Chicago and very easy to go to everywhere. </s>
<s> than that ; I did not find anything in this hotel that worth the price it charged. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel to any friend and I would certainly not stay there again. </s>
<s> Chicago ; Millennium Park - My wife and I just got back from Chicago ; where we stayed at the Fairmont. </s>
<s> trip was awesome and the great food ; elegantly styled room and amazing service at the hotel were definitely a large reason our trip was so good. </s>
<s> highly recommend this hotel ! The James Chicago - Though the hotel was at a great location ; the rooms were very small and I could hear normal talks in the adjacent rooms. </s>
<s> had to figure out myself how to connect to the wireless internet connection and only to know that the speed was very slow and the range itself was not good. </s>
<s> breakfast was not worth the money. </s>
<s> would never go there again. </s>
<s> Sheraton Chicago is not the place to be if you want to experience Chicago. </s>
<s> are no customer services to provide you with ideas of what to do ; and there are n't even any shuttles that will bring you around town. </s>
<s> food in the restaurant at the Hotel serves mediocre burgers and fries ; and makes no attempt to emulate the Chicago culture. </s>
<s> are a million other hotels in Chicago ; and this is one of the most average. </s>
<s> rooms are fairly decent sized ; but they lack amenities like wi-fi and mini bars. </s>
<s> view is nothing special ; and the concierge is anything but responsive to phone calls. </s>
<s> stay at the Millenium was amazing ! Me and my husband came to Chicago for our anniversary ; and there was a mess-up with our reservation ; so we got upgraded to a superior room for free. </s>
<s> location was excellent ; since it allowed us to visit all the nearby museums and shopping centers without having to rent a taxi. </s>
<s> bartender at the bar downstairs was very friendly ; and introduced us to drinks we 've never heard of before. </s>
<s> you ! Our room directly overlooked Lake Michigan ; and it was very spacious ; with an easy-access minibar and a very nice bathroom. </s>
<s> only complaint is that the wireless is a little pricey ; but other than that ; it was an amazing stay ! Will come back to again ! ' Amalfi Hotel Chicago-I recently stayed there for 2 nights during my short visit to the University of Chicago. </s>
<s> 's a little expensive since I booked it quite late but it 's TOTALLY worth it ! It is located in a great and safe neighborhood in downtown Chicago ; within walking distance to the University of Chicago. </s>

<s> Recommend ! I am writing about my recent stay at the Ambassador East Hotel. </s>

<s> thumbs up to Those who run that place ; and helped us enjoy our stay. </s>
<s> Homewood Suites is one of my favorite hotels in Chicago ! It is a great place to stay as a family. </s>
<s> last time my family and I visited Chicago ; we stayed and picked the Shedd Aquarium package. </s>
<s> an amazing time ! The Aquarium is great ; and we saved a lot of money by buying this package. </s>
<s> also appreciated that fact that our room had a kitchen. </s>
<s> two really picky children ; it was so nice to be able to cook ; or at least to have the option. </s>
<s> also enjoyed the many neat facilities in the Homewood Suites Chicago Downtown. </s>
<s> pool ; great workout room ; breakfast buffet and the wine and beer dinner in the evening. </s>
<s> would n't stay anywhere else when I visit the Windy City ! As a former Chicagoan ; I 'm appalled at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago. </s>
<s> of all ; I was expecting luxury and hospitality ; neither of which I received. </s>
<s> 's an Experience Designer who is supposed to be like a " personal concierge ; " but my experience with my ED was terrible. </s>
<s> felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than I wanted to. </s>
<s> only that ; but I could n't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast. </s>
<s> I finally got to my room ; I was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room 's cleanliness. </s>
<s> had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. </s>
<s> top of that ; the bed was messily done ; I could have done a better job on my own bed at home. </s>
<s> was angry at this point ; because I was paying a lot of money for every night I was staying at Amalfi ; and I did n't expect to be greeted with wet towels. </s>
<s> needed to use the Wi-Fi to download some important documents ; and the internet was surprisingly slow. </s>
<s> a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better ; maybe even faster internet access. </s>
<s> I finally checked out of the Amalfi ; I made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems I 'd had with my room and the hotel. </s>
<s> was glad to see the Amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as I drove away ! I had high hopes for the Hilton Chicago ; but I am sad to say that I am disapointed. </s>
<s> only is it outrageously expensive ' over $ 200 for two people for one night ; but they expect you to pay over $ 40 to park your car ! They do not offer free Wi-Fi ; but instead I had to pay $ 20 to get on the internet in my room. </s>
<s> had to wait until 3 pm to check in ' even though my flight was in the morning and I had to rent a car at the airport because the hotel did not offer transportation too and from. </s>
<s> all of this stress ; the Hilton Chicago did n't have an in hotel bar either. </s>
<s> doubt I will stay here again ! I have to thank the Ambassador East Hotel for providing a really great experience for my family. </s>
<s> never leave our dog at home when we travel ; and it 's been a long time since we 've been able to find a place of this caliber that allows pets. </s>
<s> staff even spent time cooing over how cute our dog is when we asked about local clothing boutiques. </s>
<s> husband liked the fitness room. </s>
<s> was nice and clean ; with plenty of extra towels available. </s>
<s> was colder than we expected with the wind blowing in off the water ; but the concierge knew exactly where we should go for jackets and scarves. </s>
<s> will definitely be staying here next time we visit Chicago. </s>
<s> would make the trip just to stay here. </s>

<s> problems for us started when we went to our room. </s>
<s> have sinus problems ; so I did n't notice the smell in our room ; and my wife did n't say anything to me because she wanted to go with the flow and not ruin our weekend. </s>
<s> could n't find the remote for our television and we did n't call down ; we were trying to be good sports. </s>
<s> were both disappointed when we realized that our hotel did n't have a pool or hot tub ; swimming and relaxing in a hot tub is one of the reasons we go on vacation. </s>
<s> checking out I was hit was 250 dollar fee for smoking in our room. </s>
<s> wife and I do n't smoke and there was nothing we could do to get out of the smoking fee. </s>
<s> that was n't bad enough we were hit with a 50 fee for the missing remote control. </s>

<s> we checked in ; we lugged all of our luggage upstairs to our room to find that someone was already in it. </s>
<s> then returned to Lobby ; and to our dismay ; the hotel had Double Booked the room ! After another 30 minutes of haggling and whatnot we were able to be moved to a " better " room. </s>
<s> bed was unbearable ; the shower looked like it hadnt been cleaned properly and the room smelled of cigarrettes ' although it was supposedly a non-smoking room. </s>
<s> tired and jet lagged to complain we went to sleep. </s>
<s> ; it was hard for us to do so because voices could be heard all thoughout the night due to the paper thin walls of the room. </s>
<s> needed an Ambien to go to sleep. </s>
<s> woke up with backaches ; the continental breakfast had me in the bathroom most of the day ; and the maids conveniently forgot to clean our room. </s>
<s> and my husband had had enough and decided to go to the Hyatt. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor ; unfortunately one of the rooms had n't even been cleaned which meant more waiting around. </s>
<s> staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating. </s>
<s> our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5 : 30am. </s>
<s> my calls to the front desk ; the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes. </s>

<s> room given to us was big enough but servicing was bad. </s>
<s> dint get the ordered food on time and had to call them again to remind them. </s>
<s> were stubborn at times and we were quite unhappy with their behavior. </s>

<s> our anniversary this year ; my wife and I stayed at the Conrad. </s>
<s> 're from the suburbs ; so staying at a nice hotel in the city is a big deal for us. </s>
<s> 's expensive ; so we expect the best for our money. </s>
<s> was most definitely not the best for our money. </s>
<s> was n't even a good deal either. </s>
<s> problems began right off the bat. </s>
<s> we got to our room ; we were both greeted by a musty smell that seemed to hang throughout the entirety of the room. </s>
<s> was like walking into a dusty attic. </s>
<s> I sat down to watch TV ; it turns out it was n't even connected to cable or anything. </s>
<s> kept changing the channel ; but it was nothing but static and white noise. </s>

<s> family really enjoyed dining on the contemporary American cuisine at the hotels Zest Restaurant ; which served an excellent meal worth every dime of its reasonable price. </s>
<s> most favorite point about the InterContinental Chicago is that it provides entry right into the Windy City ; where my family and I had immediate access to transportation ; shopping ; and city attractions. </s>
<s> had a great time traveling through Chicago and enjoying ourselves while at the same time we felt secure knowing that we had a nice ; clean ; elegant ; safe hotel to travel back to whenever we were done touring the city each day. </s>

<s> I told the clerk that a king sized was promised when i made the reservation ; he just shrugged his shoulders. </s>
<s> I got to my room ; I found it to be very small. </s>
<s> was supposed to be a small refrigerator in the room. </s>
<s> was n't ; although I did not bother to complain after all it did when they gave me the wrong bed. </s>
<s> night ; there seemed to be some sort of convention being held at the hotel. </s>
<s> did not figure what the convention was for ; but their attendees liked to stay up until the early morning and made way too much noise. </s>
<s> called the front desk several times complaining about the noise. </s>
<s> time they assured me they would deal with the noise ; but the racket never dissipated and I finally gave up getting any sleep. </s>
<s> did go back to the lobby before my trip ended to complain of the poor service that they have given me ; the manager said that she felt sorry for the trouble I had been having at the hotel ; but did not offer any refund or consolation for the trouble. </s>
<s> I left the Ambassador East ; I vowed that if I ever returned to Chigaco ; I would never stay at this place again. </s>

<s> said I had one ; and gave him the voucher I 'd printed out. </s>
<s> checked it ; and said that all the single rooms had already been rented out ; he went on to say that I would have to pay extra for a two or three person room if I wished to stay the night. </s>

<s> clerk offered to walk me to my room ; saying I looked tired and trying to navigate the hotel would be much easier after I got some sleep. </s>

<s> carried the briefcase I had with me ; but it was not apparent why at the time as I had both hands free. </s>
<s> ushered me into my room ; setting the briefcase down inside ; and said if I needed anything that the phone next to the bed would give me a direct line to room service without having to dial anything. </s>
<s> thanked him and closed the door. </s>
<s> was then that I looked around and fully saw where I was staying. </s>
<s> was supposedly a two person suite was two twin beds 6 " apart ; covered in ruffled blankets and sheets. </s>
<s> cleaning staff had obviously not been in here recently. </s>

<s> got ready for bed ; and looked around for the TV remote ; which it turned out ; had no batteries in it. </s>

<s> asked her about it ; and she said if anyone carried my bags to my room for me it was filed under the baggage service. </s>
<s> asked if it was considered reasonable to charge $ 80 for carrying a suitcase to a room two floors up ; and riding the elevator ; and she said it was unusual ; but not unheard of. </s>
<s> offered to change it to a " mere " $ 20 and handed me a slip with a phone number ; name ; and reason for the disagreement ; saying that the manager would handle any complaints between the clerk and I after I signed it. </s>

<s> did n't have any problems at all but if I did I 'm sure the customer service at the hotel would have had it fixed very quick I could tell their top priority was the guests happiness and satisfaction !

<s> felt like I was on a luxurious vacation ! My husband and I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. </s>
<s> I expected to be a very pleasant experience ; turned out to be a stressful visit. </s>
<s> specifically reserved a non-smoking king room and paid the price for that reservation. </s>

<s> we had no other options ; we accepted a smoking room with two queen beds. </s>
<s> can live with the bed situation but I truly feel that having to accept a room infused with cigarette smoke is completely wrong ! There was n't an area in the room where I did not feel nauseous from the stale smell and I can not help but think that this smell followed me around all day after check out. </s>
<s> add insult to injury ; the hotel staff was not sympathetic to our situation -- something I think they should be specifically trained to do -- and did not offer any compensation ; partial refund or related " perk " to make up for our great inconvenience. </s>
<s> staff members actually acted as if I was the inconvenience in asking them if there was anything they could do ! Although we paid for the breakfast package ; we were eager to leave immediately in the morning and dined elsewhere at our additional expense. </s>
<s> the pun ; but we just could not sit there and dine in the morning with such a bad taste in our mouth from the hotel 's lack of customer service ! I am hoping the corporate office responds to our complaints but ; thus far ; we have received no satisfaction. </s>
<s> to say ; we will not be visiting this property again ! In fact ; we are no longer going to patronize this brand of hotels. </s>
<s> a hotel rated with four diamonds by AAA ; one would think the Hilton Chicago would be almost like staying at a palace with royalty. </s>
<s> only royal thing about this hotel however is that it was a royal nightmare. </s>
<s> should have known from the moment I walked in with my wife that this was going to become a bigger headache than what it was worth. </s>
<s> off ; as soon as we arrived to check in at the hotel with the clerk who could n't be any older than nineteen or twenty ; red flags started going up. </s>
<s> clerk was extremely rude and lazy ; acting like it was a chore even getting up from texting on his cell phone. </s>
<s> that was n't bad enough ; the clerk pretty much ignored me while blatantly staring at my wife 's breasts. </s>
<s> was n't even wearing anything that could be considered skimpy as it was cold out and she was wearing a turtle neck sweater under a large fur lined coat. </s>
<s> diverting his atention several times we finally got our room keys. </s>
<s> should n't have been any surprise when we learned that there were no one to help us with our luggage as the clerk said they were all out on break. </s>
<s> ; that was annoying ; but we managed easy enough. </s>
<s> finally got to the third floor where our suite had been reserved for over a month and we looked forward to resting after our long trip. </s>
<s> our surprise ; not to mention our disgust and horror ; their was already a couple in what was supposed to be our room on the bed making out. </s>
<s> took almost a half hour between the couple in the room ; the front desk ; and my wife and me to get it straightened out. </s>
<s> the night clerk did n't bother following policy as they had taken our reservation off the computer to give to their friends while leaving the printed card for the day clerk. </s>
<s> what could only be described as chaos ; we were finally given another room on the next floor up. </s>
<s> were thankful when we got to it and my wife went to use the bathroom while I dropped our luggage by the beds. </s>
<s> a clinking sound I bent down to look what one of the bags could have hit to see an empty beer bottle sticking out from under the bed. </s>
<s> was about to call back down to give the clerk a piece of my mind when I heard my wife cry out. </s>
<s> on the wall of the bathroom were several roaches crawling around and I noticed something else in the sink that almost made us leave then and there. </s>
<s> ; in the sink and in very plain sight ; was a used condom ! So far we were less than thrilled about being there and we stomred back downstairs and demanded our money back. </s>
<s> then the desk manager had returned from where ever she went off to and talked us into taking another room ; free of charge to make up for our troubles. </s>
<s> room itself was thankfully clean with no bugs and no trash or any other disgusting items laying around. </s>
<s> being a lot smaller and not having the promised view that our other room should have had ; we decided to make due. </s>
<s> while my wife went to get cleaned up after our long trip I pulled my laptop out to use the so called high speed internet access. </s>
<s> should n't have even bothered as I 've used dial up that went at least three times as fast as the speeds I was getting. </s>
<s> a quick call to the desk I was informed the person responsible for the internet was gone for the day and there was nothing that could be done for the moment. </s>
<s> instead of worrying about it ; we went to get something to eat from the the onsite dinning area. </s>
<s> again we were met with rude people who either stared at my wife 's chest or forgot half of our order. </s>
<s> arguing with them for what seemed like forever over not getting everything ; we found that our found was not only bland ; it was cold ! We did n't even bother trying anything else ; that was the final straw so we got our things and found another hotel. </s>
<s> do n't know who would hire a bunch or rude employees who was barely out of high school or who could n't clean a room ; but I know that that hotel did n't deserve four diamonds unless it was in the negative. </s>
<s> place should be shut down because there is no way they know how to run a decent hotel. </s>
<s> Chicago - Not worth the price. </s>
<s> room on the second floor was very noisy due to traffic. </s>

<s> location is very good indeed ' one block from Mag Mile ; but that 's it. </s>
<s> booked a room with " a view " and as it turned out ; the " view " was of the building next to the hotel ; no joke ! Besides that ; the TV was n't working ; so I called the manager and their solution was to " downgrade " me to another room. </s>

<s> ; this was not the way the Hilton chain operates ! There continued to be problem throughout my stay. </s>
<s> asked for a wake-up call and it was 15 minutes late ; which had me scurrying around so I could make my business meeting. </s>
<s> ordered breakfast to be brought to my room ; and it never showed up -- at all ! And the water for my shower never reached anything by lukewarm ; so my shower was short and unsatisfying. </s>
<s> decided to check out of the Conrad Chicago a day earlier than originally planned because I was so dissatisfied with the hotel and the way it attempted to resolve the problems and issues. </s>
<s> my return home ; I wrote a letter to the hotel manager ; but never received a reply. </s>

<s> have to admit ; cheesy as it may sound ; I felt like a queen all weekend long : Most of the time I have at least one problem with the hotel I stayed at ; but I have to say at this point I have no complaints at all about Hotel Monaco and I will definitely look forward to staying there again during my next trip to Chicago. </s>

They did nothing to accommodate me ; and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she " did n't know the area " To tope it all off ; the fitness center was under construction so I never got to use it. </s>

<s> start off ; the rooms did not provide an adequate sound barrier between rooms. </s>
<s> to spend a quiet evening after a long day of business meetings ; I had hoped to spend a quiet night in. </s>
<s> neighbors ; however ; watching what I can only imagine was a Real House Wives of New Jersey marathon on full volume ; destroyed my chance for peaceful ambiance. </s>
<s> I asked the concierge to address the issue ; he seemed more concerned about his texting than doing his job. </s>
<s> I visited the gym ; I found their " state-of-the-art " StayFitTM gym consisted in nothing more than a couple of treadmills ; weights and yoga mats. </s>
<s> water in the cooler was quite warm ; and the workout towels were stained and tattered. </s>

<s> Chicago - I stayed at Hotel Hilton in Chicago in June last year ; when I was on a holiday with friends. </s>

<s> reached close to midnight and there was no one at the reception area to attend to us although we had pre-booked our rooms online a week before the arrival. </s>
<s> had to wait for almost an hour before we finally checked-in. </s>

<s> accompanied my husband on a business trip to Chicago back in September and we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel. </s>

<s> to mention the perfect service from the resort 's employees ! I was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs. </s>
<s> 'm naturally a fitness freak ; so I was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the 11th floor. </s>
<s> of all ; it was available to guests at any time ; day or night. </s>

<s> for the weekend with my wife and had a wonderful time. </s>
<s> hotel is one of the cleanest well kept hotels i have stayed at. </s>

<s> staff was very polite and helpfull and the rooms were very comfortable and felt like home. </s>
<s> loved the area of chicago the hotel was in there wasnt alot of crim around and i felt safe being in a new city. </s>
<s> would never stay here again. </s>
<s> a hotel that calls itself a four-diamond hotel ; it can not even provide the most basic amenities and services. </s>
<s> would have been more comfortable staying in a run-down motel. </s>
<s> bathroom had not been cleaned properly and the sheets were stained. </s>
<s> Review of the Hard Rock Hotel- I find that the Hard Rock Hotel ; located in Chicago ; has extrodinary scenary. </s>
<s> hotel is extremely clean with shining furniture and the rooms are breathtaking. </s>
<s> ? Visit this hotel for yourself to see what excellence they provide at the dinner tables. </s>
<s> hotel also host events such as ballet ; fun in the bar and a dj to name a few. </s>
<s> hotel is definitely worth your while. </s>
<s> will most definitely visit again. </s>
<s> your reservation as soon as possible and do n't forget your camera ! I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco and I must say ; it has become one of my favorite hotels in the windy city. </s>
<s> the past ; I 've always stayed at the Marriott or the Hilton so this time I thought I 'd go with a boutique hotel. </s>
<s> 've stayed at some of the Kimpton properties in San Francisco so I was delighted that they are running the Monaco. </s>
<s> ; I like the friendly ; real-people atmosphere as opposed to the corporate style places I 've used before. </s>
<s> do work out and they had a decent fitness center with the treadmill I normally use. </s>
<s> Water Kitchen served a terrific meal even in a city of great restaurants. </s>
<s> really dug the complimentary coffee ; high speed internet and newspaper. </s>
<s> get tired of being nickel and dimed by the corporate hotels and liked the fact that the Monaco offered a bunch of freebies -- especially liked the afternoon wine service. </s>
<s> in all ; I will return to the Monaco. </s>
<s> 's a great alternative. </s>
<s> Hotel - Talbott hotel is like our home away from home. </s>
<s> we visit chicago ; we stay there only. </s>
<s> is close to Michigan Ave and the famed Water Tower. </s>
<s> price is an excellent factor considering the amenities provided. </s>
<s> our last stay ; the staff was very helpful ; they upgraded our room to king size considering our repetitive stay. </s>
<s> rooms are spacious ; clean and bright. </s>
<s> would highly recommend Talbott. </s>
<s> Hilton Chicago- When we arrived at the Hilton Chicago we expected a reasonably nice chain hotel for our stay in Chicago. </s>
<s> price online seemed pretty reasonable and the location seemed to be pretty good. </s>
<s> were we wrong. </s>
<s> were nickled and dimed at every turn. </s>
<s> is ridiculous even for a city at $ 45 a day for self parking. </s>
<s> advertise free wifi but read the fine print and realize that is only in the lobby or shell out a hundred extra for business class rooms. </s>
<s> felt like I was still in the airport being charged for every little thing. </s>
<s> hotel itself is the hotel equivalent of a McMansion : it tries hard to look like something high class but a second glance shows a somewhat pedestrian lobby space that has high vaulted ceilings and faux paintings to pretend to be a true luxury hotel. </s>
<s> room itself was reasonably sized ; for a lower end hotel. </s>
<s> I am paying up for a Hilton I expect more than the bare bones. </s>
<s> room had a view of an alley. </s>
<s> we asked to be switched to a lake view room we were told the upgrade would be an additional fee. </s>
<s> also say they are centrally located but central to what ? The hotel is near Grant Park but any other part of the city is an L ride away at least. </s>
<s> the L is fantastic ; a city like Chicago is best observed by walking ; though it would be best if you avoid breaking a sweat or you will need to rinse off in the phone booth sized shower. </s>
<s> the Hilton provides a hardly passable experience where you will walk away feeling like your pocket was picked for a weak product. </s>
<s> would first like to say how inviting the rooms themselves are. </s>
<s> my wife and I ; we enjoy the warmer colors. </s>
<s> along with excellent staff ; made me feel away from home yet relaxed. </s>
<s> right Downtown was perfect for location. </s>
<s> suites are very quiet as well. </s>
<s> surprised my wife with the " Shopping Package " . </s>
<s> a hit ! Thanks Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown ! My stay at the Sofitel was great. </s>
<s> loved the location it was in. </s>
<s> the moment I arrived the experince was great ; the attendants were helpful and the front desk was too. </s>
<s> thought the room was elegant and very clean as well as comfortable. </s>
<s> room service was excllent and they were very friendly. </s>
<s> was a breeze and I couldnt ask for anything more in a hotel stay. </s>
<s> Hilton Hotel helped us make the most of our trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> only are they centrally located near most of Chi towns hot spots ; but they also helped coordinate discounted admissions to various other attractions. </s>
<s> Hilton is very classy with their accommodations. </s>
<s> will be returning at my earliest convenience ; be it for business or pleasure. </s>
<s> - I was not impressed with this hotel. </s>
<s> have stayed at other hotels in the Chicago area in the past and Fairmont Chicago pales in comparison to those. </s>
<s> checking in ; I noticed that the room had not been cleaned and only the bed was made. </s>
<s> ; the tables had cigarette burns on it. </s>
<s> inspecting the bathroom ; I found out that the bathroom doors did not close properly. </s>
<s> I tried to get some work done ; I had trouble with the spotty wi-fi because I kept getting disconnecting after every few minutes. </s>
<s> the bed was comfortable ; I could not get much sleep due to the street-level noise of vehicles and people. </s>
<s> would not recommend this hotel at all and will definitely stay at another hotel the next time I 'm in Chicago. </s>
<s> wife and I live in the Western Suburbs of Chicago. </s>
<s> our anniversary ; we booked a night at the Fairmont based on recommendations from friends. </s>
<s> the staff of the hotel was quite friendly and helpful and the location ideal for a night out in the city ; the accommodations themselves were not up to our expectations. </s>
<s> starters ; we requested a non-smoking room which we did receive. </s>
<s> ; the hallway leading up to our room had a distinctive smell of smoke which certainly was a turn off for both of us. </s>
<s> the room was certainly adequate ; the bathroom light had a distinct flicker and there was no complementary shampoo included. </s>
<s> the latter may seem like a minor offense ; it is not what one expects from hotel of such reported quality. </s>
<s> ; the cost of parking seemed to be somewhat inflated even for Chicago 's standards. </s>
<s> summary ; the Fairmont is a decent quality hotel but for the price ; I am sure we could of done better. </s>
<s> Chicago-I did not like my stay at the James. </s>
<s> was a bit too noisy on the lower floors ' we were fourth ; facing away from the lake ; and the water pressure was not very good on the showers. </s>
<s> management did try to alleviate the situation with the showerhead ; but they got to our request on the third day of our stay. </s>
<s> only plus was that the location was pretty good ; we were by the Lake and a couple blocks northeast of the El. </s>
<s> ; for the price ; it was not worth it. </s>
<s> Chicago - When planning my last visit to Chicago ; I looked at many hotels but quickly focused on the Allegro mainly because I felt that a 4 star hotel for under $ 200 a night was a very good deal. </s>
<s> ; after having spent a couple of nights there ; I can assure you it is. </s>
<s> was a leisure trip ; half to spend time with friends and half to see how the city had changed in the last 2 years since I visited it and so I wanted to try to get a separate living suite so my friends ' who do n't live in the downtown area could spend more time with me. </s>
<s> the King Suite at the Allegro made this trip a lot easier and more fun. </s>
<s> separate living suite allowed me to spend more time with my friends after we had hit the bars and clubs ; and they could actually spend the night in my room comfortably. </s>
<s> was n't possible in pretty much all the other hotels I 've stayed at. </s>
<s> from that ; the hotel is of pretty standard quality as far as 4 star hotels go ; and I could n't tell you much about the location since I like to walk about cities. </s>
<s> ; the separate living area in a 4 star hotel all for under $ 350 was a great deal ; rooms like that usually go for hundreds more. </s>
<s> stayed two nights at the Hilton Chicago. </s>
<s> was the last time I will be staying there. </s>
<s> I arrived ; I could not believe that the hotel did not offer free parking. </s>
<s> wanted at least $ 10. </s>
<s> am I paying for when I stay there for the night ? The website also touted the clean linens. </s>
<s> room was clean and I believe the linens were clean. </s>
<s> problem was with all of the down pillows etc. </s>
<s> n't they know that people have allergies ? I also later found out that this hotel allows pets. </s>
<s> think that this was another part of my symptoms. </s>
<s> you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks I suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay. </s>
<s> did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking. </s>
<s> hidden costs. </s>
<s> will try somewhere else in the future. </s>
<s> worth the money or the sneezing all night. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for three nights last month. </s>
<s> were celebrating our anniversary ; so we decided to splurge on the Prestige Suite. </s>
<s> to the website ; we were to be given either a city or park view ; neither of which we had. </s>
<s> ; our room was overlooking a dirty field with some sparse trees. </s>
<s> woman who checked us into our room was rude and impatient ; and the man who helped with our bags was the same. </s>
<s> we got to the room ; the beds were unkempt and the floors were in serious need of a vacuuming. </s>
<s> bathroom was dirty and there was dried toothpaste in the sink. </s>
<s> husband requested that we be given another room ; preferably a clean one ; but the clerk told us that there were no other rooms available. </s>
<s> given the chance ; I would not stay at this hotel again ; even if I were offered a free night. </s>
<s> really loved my stay at the Talbott. </s>
<s> room was amazing ! The bathroom ' and I am VERY picky about hotel bathrooms had ample room for all of my stuff ; which is a bonus for me. </s>
<s> staff treated me really well and they were very friendly. </s>
<s> was afraid that I 'd get a little lost ; since it was my first trip to Chicago ; but the staff helped me navigate to the downtown area ' Rush St. </s>
<s> 'Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> -- which are ' very close by. </s>
<s> hotel reminded me of those I 'd stayed at in Europe. </s>
<s> room service is 24 hours ; which for me ; was a bonus because I am up mostly during the nights. </s>
<s> is the ' only place I will ever stay if I visit Chicago again. </s>
<s> a single woman traveling alone to a strange city ; this hotel made me feel very safe and comfortable. </s>
<s> a gorgeous hotel ! From the moment we stepped inside the warm colors of the lobby made us feel welcome at the Sheraton and in Chicago. </s>
<s> heavenly beds made the view from our room that much better ; and to top it off with great restaurants ; you could n't ask a hotel for more ! Starbucks coffee in the rooms were just an extra touch that guarantees we 'll be back every time we visit Chicago. </s>
<s> just got back from the Monaco in Chicago ! I was very pleasantly surprised ; as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway ; and he usually picks bad places-haha. </s>
<s> ; the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated. </s>
<s> was busy and the line was a little long ; but it moved quickly. </s>
<s> lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good ; especially since it seemed to be near full. </s>
<s> room was clean and spacious ' especially considering it 's a city hotel. </s>
<s> made a lot of use of the concierge ; since again ; it was so last minute we did n't really make any plans. </s>
<s> gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy ! It was also great being near the theater district ; and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare. </s>
<s> thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room ! very trendy. </s>
<s> husband is not as easily impressed ; but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon. </s>
<s> ; really nice stay in a four star ; or probably four and half star hotel ! This hotel was incredible ! Have n't had a better stay in a hotel in my life. </s>
<s> will definitely come here again next time I am in Chicago ! The rooms were so elegant ; with their modern color schemes. </s>
<s> staff members were friendly and willing to lend a hand. </s>
<s> beds were surprisingly comfortable ; with interesting covers. </s>
<s> TVs were HD ; which was a step up from most hotels i have stayed at before. </s>
<s> was a cool martini bar that I spent an hour at one night ; which was enjoyable ; especially because of the live jazz band the experince at the hard rock hotel in chicago was fantastic ; i will rate them a 6 out of 5. </s>
<s> have wonderful service and great staff and the view is just wonderful. </s>
<s> off ; do n't get a room on a lower floor ; the garbage pick up makes a ton of noise and wakes you up at 6 am. </s>
<s> do n't bother going down for breakfast at that time either ; because the restaurant is n't open that early. </s>
<s> it finally opened ; the breakfast arrived cold and late. </s>
<s> like congealed eggs to start your day. </s>
<s> fitness center had no towels and no cups for water. </s>
<s> was also too hot and too many people had sweated too much in it. </s>
<s> my congealed breakfast ; it really was not pleasant. </s>
<s> entire three day visit was like that. </s>
<s> tried room service that night ; but again ; service was very slow and the food not warm when it arrived. </s>
<s> high speed internet was not so high speed when it would connect me at all. </s>
<s> furniture was run down and worn. </s>
<s> towels were not always available. </s>
<s> ; for the price I paid ; I would expect better service and a better maintained premises. </s>
<s> has many wonderful luxury hotels for tourists and business travelers. </s>
<s> visiting the Windy City ; however ; the Conrad Hotel and Resort is one to avoid. </s>
<s> the description promises clean accommodations ; luxury amenities ; and " deep soaking tubs ; " in relity ; the rooms fall short of expectations. </s>
<s> opened the door to my suite to find a musty smell in the room similar to that of an old neglected closet. </s>
<s> bit disappointed ; I decided to ignore this fact. </s>
<s> to take a nice long soak after my travels ; I made my way to the bathroom. </s>
<s> I did find a large ; deep bathtub ; there was a hard water stain giving it a dingy look. </s>
<s> what I expected for the price I paid for the accommodations. </s>
<s> the corner of the bathroom ; I found a reminder of a pevious guest ; a clump of blond hair. </s>
<s> maid service seemed to be lacking. </s>
<s> to be deterred from enjoying my stay ; I decided to watch television on the 42 inch flat screen I had been promised. </s>
<s> ; the battery to the remote control was dead. </s>
<s> called the front desk ; at my wits end ; to complain about the issues ; but was greeted by a desk clerk with a very sassy attitude who seemed to doubt my every word. </s>
<s> ; I would definitely not recommend the Conrad Hotel and Resort in Chicago. </s>
<s> room was dirty ; the staff was unfriendly ; and the ammenities were few and far between. </s>
<s> my next stay in Chicago ; I will definitely stay elsewhere. </s>
<s> Chicago ; " This hotel has a mediocre service. </s>
<s> ordered for room service and it arrived very late and there was n't an apology also. </s>

<s> " 
My husband and I recently stayed at the Conrad Chicago for three nights ; a Thursday through Saturday. </s>
<s> me say we were less than pleased with our experience. </s>
<s> chose to stay in the " King Bed Deluxe Room " and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations. </s>
<s> entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly ; the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser. </s>
<s> room was size was average ; and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room. </s>
<s> major annoyance was how loud people were. </s>
<s> came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running. </s>
<s> is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel. </s>
<s> can expect a loud guest maybe once ; but every night is ridiculous. </s>
<s> service was also extremely sub par. </s>
<s> had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work. </s>
<s> day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me. </s>
<s> completely disregarded the sign ; did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in. </s>
<s> scared me and I 'm just glad I was not getting out of the shower or changing. </s>
<s> to sum up ; we will never stay at the Conrad again ; we will never recommend it to anyone else ; and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in Chicago. </s>
<s> would like to add a comment ; maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination. </s>
<s> daughter was married in May of 2010 and we decided to have the special event at the Sofitel Water Tower ; we were amazed. </s>
<s> always wanted a ballroom type of wedding ; and Sofitel made this happen for her. </s>
<s> took care of all the invitations ; cake decor ; and so much more. </s>
<s> special day for my daughter was worth everything. </s>
<s> you are going to be in the Chicago area ; check them out ; you will not regret it ! I had an awful experience here. </s>
<s> staff were rude and unhelpful. </s>
<s> took forever to check in and when I did ; they took a while to even find my reservation. </s>
<s> I got to the room ; it was marginally clean and when I complained ; they said they were full and could not do anything for me. </s>
<s> would never go back. </s>
<s> are obviously not worried about customer service. </s>
<s> hotel was very overpriced for what you get from staying here. </s>
<s> Amalfi Hotel Chicago advertises itself as a " luxury hotel " located in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> it is in downtown Chicago ; that means that I had street noises keeping me up most of the night. </s>
<s> view also suffered. </s>
<s> had nicer rooms available with better views ; but the markups to stay in them was outrageous ! The room itself was decent ; with clean linens and nice air conditioning ; but I can get that in just about any hotel these days. </s>
<s> was n't anything particularly luxurious about the hotel to make it a stand-out for me ; but for the price I paid for the room ; I certainly had that expectation. </s>
<s> was a let down. </s>
<s> Chicago is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. </s>
<s> in my life have I been treated so poorly as a guest. </s>
<s> front desk was very unaccommodating when I asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation. </s>
<s> was no bellhop available for some strange reason so I had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself. </s>
<s> it was n't already a bad stay ; I ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered. </s>
<s> they did n't have air conditioning in the room ; I would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable. </s>
<s> you are traveling to Chicago for any kind of business ; I hope you decide not to choose this hotel. </s>
<s> was quite surprised ; I like Chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience. </s>
<s> House A Hilton Hotel ?I was hesitant at first to book a room at the Palmer House ; but I decided to give it a try. </s>
<s> it was a high class hotel ; I did not find my stay to be worth the price I paid. </s>
<s> room was not much better than any other average hotel I have stayed at before. </s>
<s> was a pretty small room especially given the high cost. </s>
<s> food served at the Lockwood Restaurant was nothing special. </s>
<s> ; I thought it was outrageous that I had to make a reservation in order to go to the bar ; especially since I am a paying guest at the hotel. </s>
<s> the end ; I thought the Palmer House is a nice hotel but definitely not worth the amount of money I paid for my stay. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago with my wife. </s>
<s> was on business but I thought I 'd take her so we could see the city as well. </s>
<s> was great ; The Allegro . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> not so much. </s>
<s> mean it looked nice ; great lobby and all. </s>
<s> service was n't so great though. </s>
<s> clerk was a younger girl who seemed a bit rude. </s>
<s> we were bothering her and interrupting her day by wanting to book a weekend. </s>
<s> bell hop took our bags to our room ; none to gently. </s>
<s> wife and I watched as he threw our luggage on the floor in our room. </s>
<s> was n't that bad till he actually asked for a tip ! Our room was okay. </s>
<s> bed was sort of rough and made a odd plastic rubbing noise every time you moved. </s>
<s> next day my wife went out and returned to find our room was n't cleaned. </s>
<s> trip to the Chicago had it 's nice moments ; all outside the hotel. </s>
<s> Hotel Allegro seemed like they spent too much on the appearance and neglected to staff it better. </s>
<s> wo n't stay there again. </s>
<s> hotel is overpriced. </s>
<s> should pay money for luxury ; but they fall far short considering the prices that they charge. </s>
<s> you go to the hotel restaurants you expect a certain mark-up because ; yes ; they do have to make money. </s>
<s> the prices they charge for food that was okay makes little sense to me. </s>
<s> I got there and went to my room ; I thought that there would be nice colors ; a great view ; and deluxe bedding. </s>
<s> I got were sheets that might have come from the full price section of target -- they were not cheap ; but not that expensive either. </s>
<s> think I could have found something of this quality at less than the 200ish a night I paid. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed in the Hilton Chicago and had a very nice stay ! The rooms were large and comfortable. </s>
<s> view of Lake Michigan from our room was gorgeous. </s>
<s> service was really good and quick ; eating in the room looking at that view ; awesome ! The pool was really nice but we didnt get a chance to use it. </s>
<s> location for all of the downtown Chicago attractions such as theaters and museums. </s>
<s> friendly staff and knowledgable ; you cant go wrong staying here. </s>
<s> Intercontinental Chicago was not as great an experience as I was expecting it to be. </s>
<s> I first arrived the front desk staff could not find my reservation in the system. </s>
<s> then tried to make me book a higher paying room. </s>
<s> ended up having to ask for the manager ; who conveniently was able to locate a room for me with the same rate. </s>
<s> was expecting top notch service and class but apparently those services are reserved for the elite. </s>
<s> was not doted on as I should have been and found that I had long wait times when I placed an order with room service or needed the concierge. </s>
<s> the price I was paying to stay there I would have thought there would have been more of a catered and personal touch to the service. </s>
<s> here for two nights and really enjoyed the stay. </s>
<s> cost was a little bit more than I usually care to spend ; but turned out to be a great value. </s>
<s> was walking distance to restaurants and the subway. </s>
<s> close to the Miracle Mile and Millennium Park. </s>
<s> was large ; cozy ; and beautiful- especially loved the window seats with a great view of the river. </s>
<s> wine hour and a goldfish in the room made this a special experience ! When I arrived at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I was shocked at the poor and dangerous neighborhood it was situated in. </s>
<s> was not the Chicago I was hoping for. </s>
<s> addition to that ; it looked nothing like it did in the pictures on their website. </s>
<s> paint was faded and chipped ; there was a foul odor in the lobby and there was no staff to speak of. </s>
<s> we waited for 15 minutes at the front desk ; someone finally came and said that they did not have a reservation under our name. </s>
<s> a long trip ; I 'm sure you know how aggravating that was. </s>
<s> I got a manager that knew how to work the computer properly and he brought up our reservation. </s>
<s> we got to our room ; it was very small ; smelled like smoke and the carpet was severely stained with either wine or blood. </s>
<s> ; as we were walking to the room in the hallway ; a cockroach walked right across our path like he owned the place. </s>
<s> top it off it seemed everyone staying at the hotel was a gangster or a gambler and his lady for the night. </s>
<s> we heard was lots of frighteningly loud love making and arguments ensuing that even a television could not mask. </s>
<s> was a nightmare. </s>
<s> yeah ; and the shower did have any hot water. </s>
<s> complained to the desk and they said that it was not there fault and that it would be fixed my next week. </s>
<s> we asked for a discount they said that there were no refunds and that we could leave whenever we wanted. </s>
<s> me just preface this by saying that I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel. </s>
<s> chose it largely for location as I do n't really love to walk that much and I was incredibly pleased with its situation in the city. </s>
<s> was just a couple blocks away from several museums and shopping districts but my husband and I mainly ventured out for food ; of which there were great options and the concierge was a great help. </s>
<s> had originally booked the King Guestroom but upon arrival were upgraded to the Deluxe King Guestroom by the front desk. </s>
<s> was remarkably friendly and helpful which is something I look for and remember when I go to stay in a location again. </s>
<s> room was amazing. </s>
<s> amazing. </s>
<s> was so chic and I just loved the headboard over our bed. </s>
<s> was n't one little spot of dust to be found. </s>
<s> bathroom was gorgeous and we made full use of the two bathrobes in the closet. </s>
<s> did n't take anything from the snack bar but it all looked delicious. </s>
<s> had dinner at David Burke 's Primehouse. </s>
<s> can not recommend the NY Ribeye more highly. </s>
<s> was fantastic. </s>
<s> dessert we had the brown butter corn cake. </s>
<s> 've been trying to replicate that dish ever since I got home. </s>
<s> 'm sad to say that I did n't get a chance to try any of the treatments at Spa by Asha but I definitely will make a point to on my return visit. </s>
<s> James Chicago made our trip to Chicago memorable. </s>
<s> staff was friendly ; the hotel beautiful ; and the food delicious. </s>
<s> more could you want ? I have been stayed in Allegro for two days. </s>
<s> are not other big prolems but one thing I 'm not satisfied with is the light. </s>
<s> is dark in the room. </s>
<s> in the bathroom ; the light is not good. </s>
<s> have to open curtains. </s>
<s> have complained about this to their reception. </s>
<s> said they will fix it ; but I did not get any response. </s>
<s> am very disappointed and I will never come back again. </s>
<s> Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a nice place to stay if you need a place to stay on quick notice ; but it certainly does not " exceed expectations " as touted on their website. </s>
<s> Starpoints system is somewhat complicated and not helpful for the frequent traveler. </s>
<s> Chic but not fussy " is an overstatement. </s>
<s> room was clean ; although the bed covering was wrinkled and the bathroom counter had water lying on it that appeared as though it had n't been cleaned since the last guest. </s>
<s> was hand lotion and shampoo samples ; but no soap sample. </s>
<s> bathroom was short on two towels and it took two calls to housekeeping to get this fixed. </s>
<s> Cheap " might have been a better adjective. </s>
<s> out was simple and not much hassle. </s>
<s> ; the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is fine in a pinch ; but next time ; I will research hotels a little better before making a decision and reserving a room. </s>
<s> and my business associate had a job in Chicago and wanted to stay somewhere that had more features. </s>
<s> did some research online and came across the Hotel Moncaco. </s>
<s> decided to stay for 3 nights. </s>

<s> of course ; a unique experience includes being kept awake all night by a party in the room next door. </s>
<s> you plan on staying there for a chance to meet your favorite celebrity or musician you will be sorely disappointed. </s>
<s> " A " list celebrities will not be there. </s>
<s> fact ; it would be rare to find anyone on the " B " list either. </s>
<s> party that keeps you awake will not be your favorite band practicing for their next concert. </s>
<s> party is being held by the musicians that were not even able to gain work at a local coffee bar. </s>
<s> walls of the rooms are so thin you can hear every wrong note played. </s>
<s> for the promise of Art Deco ; it must have changed in definition. </s>
<s> room will truly look like a concert has just been held. </s>
<s> carpet smelled like it had been shampooed in beer. </s>
<s> bathroom lets just say that clean was not the correct description. </s>
<s> service and amenities were severely lacking. </s>
<s> are not greeted with warmth but with disdain. </s>
<s> not bother complaining about the noise next door either. </s>
<s> is part of you unique experience. </s>
<s> only part of the Hard Rock Hotel description that appeared to be accurate was that it is in a great location in Chicago. </s>
<s> was easy to find a real hotel to stay in for the rest your trip. </s>

<s> fun time was not exactly that. </s>
<s> arriving for our weekend getaway ; we find that the reservations we made online and the confirmation we held in our hand for a kids suite ; did not mean a thing. </s>
<s> ; there were none of the kids suites available. </s>

<s> one at the front desk could explain to us why there were no kids suites available. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ; we took a regular suite with the promise that we would be moved as soon as one became available. </s>
<s> what ? We spent the whole weekend in the same room. </s>
<s> ; the staff apologized ; but no one seemed overly concerned that our children were dissapointed and no compensation or extras were offered to make us less cranky about it. </s>
<s> than that and the fact the none of the hotel staff was very friendly ; the rooms were clean. </s>
<s> did not spend a lot of time in the hotel ; but I will not be booking a room here again. </s>

The Affinia in Chicago obviously caters to wedding guests and corporations hosting business conferences. </s>
<s> you do not represent one of these groups with a large number of guests and revenue for Affinia ; do not expect any measure of customer service and do n't expect great accommodations ; even at their high prices. </s>
<s> we arrived our reservation was lost ; then it took forever for the concierge to tell us the room we were instead given was available. </s>
<s> furnishings in the room were cheaply made ; the cleaning obviously superficial and our view was directly into the concrete wall of the hotel 's L shaped corridor. </s>
<s> called for fresh linens and toiletries and a very rude phone attendant told me someone would essentially be then when they had time. </s>
<s> hours later someone came. </s>
<s> dining hall and reception areas were really nice ; but again ; unless you 're a large group do n't expect to enjoy them during your stay at Affinia. </s>
<s> if you could ; the prices would n't be worth it. </s>
<s> stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was a pleasant one. </s>
<s> loved being able to take a quick stroll to Michigan Ave for some shopping. </s>
<s> also loved the Pump Room. </s>
<s> a fun place to hang out and enjoy a Blood Mary. </s>
<s> front desk staff was wonderful with my check in since my reservation was lost. </s>
<s> found me a room immediately even though the city was book up. </s>

<s> am looking forward to another stay at the Ambassador EAst in the spring when I return to Chicago. </s>
<s> selected The Talbott for my recent family vacation to Chicago. </s>
<s> chose the hotel for it 's close proximity to Navy Pier and otherwise central location. </s>
<s> retrospect ; the phrase " location ; location ; location " apparently does not apply to hotels. </s>
<s> 's a good thing the location was so great ; because just about everything that happened inside the hotel was bad. </s>
<s> our arrival ; our room was not ready. </s>
<s> clerk could have been nicer about the whole situation ; and told us simply that " we would have to wait " without offering any sort of help with our luggage or a timetable for when our room would be ready. </s>
<s> we finally arrived in the room ; the sheets were not clean. </s>
<s> call to housekeeping proved difficult ; as I do not speak Spanish. </s>
<s> second day of our trip ; housekeeping never showed to clean the room despite the presence of our " please service " sign hung on the door. </s>
<s> stayed in for some room service after a long afternoon on Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> the food finally arrived a full hour after placing our order ; it was cold and not very good. </s>
<s> these poor impressions ; the management was unwilling to compromise on price at checkout. </s>
<s> call to corporate headquarters was answered by a call center in Mumbai. </s>
<s> will not receive my business again. </s>
<s> - The conrad is a terrific hotel ! When I booked my room ; I specifically asked them for a lower floor because I have fear for the heights ; and they were really considerate in giving me a lower floor room with an excellent view. </s>

<s> Would highly recommend Hotel Allegro as a must stay vacation get-away. </s>
<s> Classy " ; " Decent " and " Serene " . </s>
<s> these words clearly define the totality of my stay at the talbott hotel in the heart of chicago. </s>
<s> hustle and bustle of the city did little to affect the conducive atmosphere for relaxation provided by this posh hotel. </s>
<s> lounge was so welcoming and flashes of smiles from every angle. </s>
<s> staff from the bell-boy to the managers were polite ; helpful and responsive to my needs. </s>
<s> room service was classy and to cap it all the beds were just as comfortable as back home ; making the talbott a home away from home. </s>
<s> wife and i enjoyed the t-rex experience and learnt a lot about the city of chicago and what it has got to offer. </s>
<s> me we will return with the kids because the talbott is family oriented and friendly to kids. </s>
<s> felt very safe. </s>
<s> we are in chicago the talbott is gonna be our home away from home ! I expected a bit more from the Hyatt Regency Chicago I stayed at recently. </s>
<s> was appalled of the conditions of the room we stayed in. </s>
<s> linens were not clean ; the toilet paper roll was nearly empty with no spare left ; and there was a lock on the door that did n't function. </s>

<s> rooms are usually intended for the well-being of even the worst cases of allergen sufferers. </s>
<s> ; when we got to our room ; one of the first things my wife did was sneeze four times. </s>
<s> setting up the channel scanning which ; the reception came in fuzzy all around ; there was an interattive ethernet feature that after ; lost in confusion of how to work it ; provided us with our first fee ! The pool was in bad shape. </s>

<s> would stay at this hotel again. </s>
<s> arriving at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel I was greeted with rudeness and snubery. </s>

<s> of having a concierge I had cockroaches. </s>
<s> dining left me wishing for fast food. </s>
<s> bar left a bad taste in my mouth with the cheap liquor and hot beer. </s>
<s> was not pleased with my recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton. </s>
<s> room was not ready upon my arrival and the room I was given was not what I had requested. </s>
<s> had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that. </s>
<s> air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off. </s>

<s> room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff. </s>
<s> promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk I finally gave up. </s>
<s> had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that I spent to stay there. </s>
<s> you are looking for a high end hotel on the Magnificent Mile ; the Affinia Chicago is NOT your best option. </s>
<s> of all ; the " central " location is not so convenient - there is quite a hike to the Navy Pier ' which this hotel claims to be the " official " hotel of and to the shops on the Mile. </s>
<s> ; the hotel is small - only 215 rooms ; most of which are miniscule by comparison to the other hotels in the area. </s>
<s> ; they have one restaurant and one lounge ; both of which offer the same menu which seems a bit bizarre for a high end hotel. </s>
<s> the Affinia has one of the most rude staffs ever witnessed in a luxury hotel. </s>
<s> does expect some courtesy at the outrageous prices but be ready for the attitude and snobbery that will greet you at the Affinia ! Last week ; I booked a ' Deluxe Suite at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago. </s>
<s> took the ' Retreat and Relax package deal. </s>
<s> wait to check in was intolerably long ; because they were letting some people check in with a dog. </s>
<s> 'm allergic to dogs ; and I 'm sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in. </s>
<s> insisted on escorting me to to my room ; every time I came in ; like I was going to break into another guest 's room or something. </s>
<s> swear ; anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks ; asking me if I needed anything. </s>
<s> know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you 're up to something. </s>
<s> went to the pool ; but it was full of screaming children. </s>
<s> I went to bed ; I could hear the television in the next room through my wall. </s>
<s> what 's worse ; they would n't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress. </s>
<s> threatened to throw me out on the street ; after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars ! I had to go outside -- probably where the dog went to piddle -- to do it. </s>
<s> ; their on-site restaurant is too expensive ; given that you 're already paying an arm and a leg for the room. </s>
<s> food should be free ! I would n't stay here again ; it was a waste of my money. </s>
<s> Chicago Hotel ?Stayed here for a 2 nights while attending a business-related conference. </s>
<s> and bathroom were clean spacious and contained all the usual amenities ; though my room surprisingly lacked a coffee machine. </s>
<s> wifi was provided : a necessity for any business traveller planning to catch up on some work. </s>
<s> continental breakfast had a wide selection of options ; from fresh fruit and cereal to hot scrambled eggs and bacon -- one of the best free breakfast options I have seen in a hotel. </s>
<s> definitely stay here again. </s>
<s> House a Hilton Hotel - Here 's a PSA : if you enjoy peace and quiet ; do NOT stay at the Chicago Hilton. </s>
<s> in ; I did n't know the place allowed pets ; and I got stuck next to a family that had brought their dog. </s>
<s> street noise - I could n't hear the cars over all the barking. </s>
<s> complained ; but management said all their basic rooms were full so I 'd have to pay for an upgrade to a suite if I wanted to move. </s>
<s> bed was comfortable enough ; but there were some stains on the comforter when I got there. </s>
<s> least management did n't try to charge me to fix THAT issue. </s>
<s> pillows were a bit over-plump as well. </s>
<s> for location ; there are some tourist spots nearby ; but some of the places I wanted to see were a decent distance away. </s>
<s> zoo and the Museum of Science are too far to walk to ; so if you want to check those places out ; you 'll have to bring your car and pay the hotel 's sky-high parking prices ; pay for a taxi ; or figure out Chicago 's public transportation system. </s>
<s> of a hassle ; really. </s>
<s> the plus side ; the hotel definitely impressed in the looks department : my room was nicely decorated and the hotel 's ballrooms were gorgeous. </s>
<s> it comes down to it ; though ; in the future ; I 'd just rather spend my money on a comfortable room in a convenient location ; rather than a pretty ; " landmark " tourist trap. </s>
<s> hotel was wonderful. </s>
<s> room was clean and the staff was courteous. </s>
<s> food provided by the restaurant was exceptional. </s>
<s> was on of the best hotel stays ; ive experienced. </s>
<s> highly suggest this hotel to others. </s>
<s> the Architecture of the hotel is quaint ; that is about the only positive of this terible hotel. </s>
<s> guest services were unhelpful at best ; and the inbuilding resturaunts were unsanitary and untasteful. </s>
<s> as for the rooms ; small ; cramped ; and it seemed as if the sheets had n't been cleaned in the last 5 years. </s>
<s> stay here was distasteful ; and I never intend to return ; except to ask for my money back. </s>
<s> Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago - I stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights several weeks ago. </s>
<s> ; it was a very comfortable experience for me. </s>
<s> staff at the front desk were very courteous. </s>
<s> were able to upgrade me from a standard room to one of their junior suites ; which was a pleasant surprise. </s>
<s> of just a single room ; there was an elegant sitting area sectioned off by a half-wall to the right of the bed ; which helped the area feel spacious. </s>
<s> the left of the bed was an AMAZING bathroom ; I loved the rainshower system ! Very relaxing. </s>
<s> did an outstanding job keeping my room clean ; and room service was very prompt. </s>
<s> only dislike about the place is that they charge for wireless internet access ; but that is standard for high-end hotels like the Millennium Knickerbocker. </s>
<s> a one night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I must say that while I loved Chicago I will never go back to this hotel. </s>
<s> problems started in the parking lot ; yup before I even got in. </s>
<s> was very little parking available and the area was filled with garbage ; broken glass and kids hanging out looking for trouble. </s>
<s> first entrance the hotel seemed nice but all that changed as we got into the elevator to go up to the room. </s>
<s> elevator made all kinds of noise and the door slammed shut on my arm as I was trying to get the bags out. </s>
<s> hall smelled of smoke and the carpets were warn and dirty looking. </s>
<s> in the room we found that one of the curtains would not pull closed ; the heater whistled and when I called the front desk to ask for assistance and fresh pillows I was hung up on. </s>
<s> was only the beginning of our terrible stay. </s>
<s> where in the hall and banging on walls all night long. </s>
<s> maids started running vacuums before 8 am and seemed to feel that the best way to do it was by hitting the vacuum on the wall with each pass. </s>
<s> could not check out soon enough ! We called around and found another hotel to stay in for the remainder of our trip. </s>
<s> Rock Hotel - I spent two nights at the Hard Rock Hotel during the week of Thanksgiving ; and to be honest ; it did not meet my expectations. </s>
<s> pictures online made the rooms look huge ; but when I arrived ; my room was no bigger than your average 4-star hotel room. </s>
<s> bathroom was clean ; but again average ; there was no luxury shower ; the toilet was cramped up against the end of the sink vanity ; and the sink itself was fairly shallow. </s>
<s> hotel is in a nice location ; but even on a Thursday night the streets below will boast noise loud enough to keep you awake. </s>
<s> ; it 's not a bad hotel ; but it 's not as exciting as you would guess. </s>
<s> Regency Chicago - When I first arrived at the Hyatt Regency I was concerned because of the size of my room ; but I was happily surprised. </s>
<s> was more than enough space. </s>
<s> beds were comfortable ; and the location in the center of Chicago is amazing. </s>
<s> only $ 150 a night ; this was a real steal. </s>
<s> Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels I have stayed at in a while. </s>
<s> almost $ 500 a night ; one would expect. </s>
<s> with my wife ; I expected to pay the cost of the room ; already being outrageous ; but then I was hit with another $ 20 charge for her to stay. </s>
<s> with a King bed ; they only figure in one person to their cost. </s>
<s> beds were average and although there was much to do ; everything cost an arm or a leg. </s>
<s> was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away. </s>
<s> in all for the amount of money that I was paying on a per night basis ; if I was in Chicago for any longer than that one night ; I definitely would have stayed somewhere else. </s>
<s> guess you live and you learn ; its just a shame that I had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations. </s>
<s> recent week stay at the Affinia Hotels ; I can definitely say i will be coming back. </s>
<s> offer so many in room amenities and services ; Just a very comfortable and relaxed place to be. </s>
<s> most enjoyable experience at the Affinia Hotel was the amazing customization they offered ; I would recommend Affinia hotels to anyone looking for a nice place to stay . </s>
<s> I first made reservations at The Palmer House Hilton ; I was excited because of all the gorgeous pictures displayed on their website. </s>
<s> did I know it was going to be a total disaster. </s>
<s> off ; my husband and I could n't find the place. </s>
<s> was our first time in Chicago after all. </s>
<s> when I would call for directions ; they just kept putting me on hold. </s>
<s> my husband and I finally arrived ; the bus boy was extremely rude. </s>
<s> man-handling our luggage ; he held his hands out impatiently expecting a tip. </s>
<s> about arrogant. </s>
<s> front desk clerk was a little too pushy. </s>
<s> husband and I were only staying one night just to attend my sister 's wedding ; but they kept trying to up-sell a suite when all we needed was a regular guest room. </s>
<s> room itself was okay ; decorated so ornately that they are forced to jack up the price and take all that you 're worth. </s>
<s> even had the nerve to try and say that we purchased some items from the " snack bar " and ordered a movie that I 've never even heard of ! Completely unprofessional. </s>
<s> will never ; I repeat ; NEVER stay at this hotel ever again. </s>
<s> Suites - Wonderful stay at the Homewood Suites Hilton ! Great location ; within walking distance to the Magnificent Mile. </s>
<s> room and attentive staff. </s>
<s> time to visit the pool as it has a great view of the cityscape. </s>
<s> definitely stay here again next time I am in Chicago. </s>
<s> had a business trip coming up in Chicago and I wanted to stay someplace really nice ; cause I had never been there ; so made reservations with the James two weeks in advance just to be on the safe side and when I arrived they had no record of it. </s>
<s> big deal ; right ? They said they would take care of it and get me a room right away . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  two hours later I 'm still sitting in the lobby ! Finally I get to my room to try and relax. </s>
<s> was nice until I decided to take a shower. </s>
<s> went into the bathroom . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  no towels ; wash cloths ; nothing. </s>
<s> called down to the front desk and asked for some ; about an hour later someone came up with one. </s>
<s> they were just really busy ? Finally I get in the shower and the handle is BROKEN ! I went down to the front desk and asked for a new room and they started implying that I broke it ! They said everything was fine with the room earlier that day and that I must have done something to it ! Leaving that hotel was the easiest decision I made on my whole trip. </s>
<s> thumbs down ! I had high hopes for the Ambassador East Hotel ; I really did. </s>
<s> seemed like a nice enough place with reasonably close beach access. </s>
<s> arrived to the hotel on a Tuesday afternoon. </s>
<s> was immediately surprised by the state of disrepair that the building was in. </s>
<s> could actually see two members of hotel maintenance in the parking lot sitting in their truck ; doing nothing. </s>
<s> I walked in ; nobody greeted me ; and nobody offered to take my bags. </s>
<s> hotel furniture looked quaint and outdated ; with a fine covering of dust. </s>
<s> went to the counter to check in and the disinterested girl working barely glanced at my papers and slid me my keys ; all while avoiding eye contact and typing on the computer. </s>
<s> got to my room ; and despite specifically asking for nonsmoking ; there was a distinct smell of cigarettes inside and in the hallway. </s>
<s> paid extra for an upgraded room ; I was extremely disappointed by the condition inside. </s>
<s> drinking glasses were filthy ; the towels smelled of mold ; and there was actually trash that was left in the bathroom trash can. </s>
<s> television was a basic CRT that looked to be about fifteen years old ; and there was no channel guide ; though I suppose I did n't need one for the six channels that it had. </s>
<s> had heard good things about the food at the Ambassador East hotel ; but alas ; there was no respite here. </s>
<s> room service that I ordered took forty minutes to arrive ; and my steak was cold and cooked beyond well done. </s>
<s> in the hotel things were no better. </s>
<s> I went ; from the pool to the bar ; the staff was hasty ; rude ; and completely uninterested ; and nowhere was particularly clean or well decorated. </s>
<s> really wanted to like the Ambassador East Hotel ; but unfortunately the best part of my stay was checking out. </s>
<s> recently stayed at this hotel not to long ago. </s>
<s> ; it looks nice ; but it 's really just a smoke screen. </s>
<s> went to the clerk to check in and she was VERY rude to me. </s>
<s> was asking about nearby attractions and she abruptly cut me off to tell me that I need to go find a phone book and ask someone else. </s>
<s> also encoded my key wrong ; so I had to have it redone. </s>
<s> finaly get to my room ; only to discover it was a mess. </s>
<s> sheets were thrown on the floor ; the curtains were wide open and to top it all off ; the toliet had n't been flushed. </s>
<s> was horrible. </s>
<s> called the front desk to have a maid come and fix it up ; but I was told they were on break. </s>
<s> thoguh ; I cleaned up myself. </s>
<s> night progresses and I awaken to the sound of someone beating on my door. </s>
<s> guy said that I was in HIS room. </s>
<s> baffled me ; but we went straight down to the lobby and got it cleared up. </s>
<s> had given his the wrong room. </s>
<s> could n't take one more day of all the bull. </s>
<s> checked out early the next morning and stayed at a different hotel for the remainder of my visit to Chicago. </s>
<s> would NOT recommend this hotel to ANYONE. </s>
<s> stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago was an amazing experience ! The staff were helpful and considerate ; always there to tend to my needs. </s>
<s> suite was extremely clean ; and had all the amenities that I could ask for. </s>
<s> almost did n't want to leave my room ; because it was so nice. </s>
<s> in the end I did ; because the hotel is situated in such a great area ; that I had to go out and see some of the sites. </s>
<s> hotel has wonderful rooms and service ; and is in a really great area. </s>
<s> suggest that everyone come here if they are staying in Chicago. </s>
<s> stay ! The hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. </s>
<s> chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was VERY close to my business conference. </s>
<s> you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown Chicago charm. </s>
<s> sure to try the ribs at South Water Kitchen next door. </s>
<s> are the best I 've ever had. </s>
<s> ! If youre in the mood to unwind ; you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around. </s>
<s> had a great time here. </s>
<s> now on ; I wo n't stay anyplace else. </s>
<s> pictures on this website sure are deceiving ! In real life the Palmer House Hilton is not nearly as pretty as its made out to be ! The cleaning staff was still there when we arrived at our room and they made us wait outside while they were still cleaning ! Now ; granted it was only 15 minutes and sometimes guests can be messy but I thought that was the only weird thing I would have to put up with on that trip. </s>
<s> was n't ! They charged us for a mini-bar fee when we do n't even drink ; no one told us that we would have to pay for liquor anyway ! They also did not get our wake-up calls to us on time ; so we missed our tour bus and almost a whole day of our trip. </s>
<s> had to spend $ 50 extra bucks on cab fees just so we could see the city in the way we 'd planned ! And then it was n't as good because the tour guide was n't there and we got lost ! My husband lost the key to our room at one point on this trip and the desk gave him a hard time about getting a new one. </s>
<s> was terrible ! I certainly wo n't be staying here again ! I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for a fun weekend in Chicago. </s>
<s> standard room had a nice king size bed that was nice and comfortable. </s>
<s> love a hotel with all white sheets because then I know it 's clean. </s>
<s> really liked the simple and modern decor ; especially the huge upholstered headboard. </s>
<s> fixtures in the bathroom and granite counter. </s>
<s> bathroom was so much nicer than my own bathroom at home. </s>
<s> staff was friendly. </s>
<s> n't really judge the service because I did n't have any problems or complaints. </s>
<s> I did n't have a reason to interact with the staff much. </s>
<s> ; it was a very nice hotel in a great location. </s>
<s> definitely stay here again on my next visit. </s>
<s> stayed here with my family when we were in Chicago on a family vacation. </s>
<s> I can say is WOW ! A fantastic experience all around. </s>
<s> off ; the hotel is magnificent ; the lobby 'entreway is jaw dropping to say the least. </s>
<s> we dealt with from the desk clerks ; to the cleaning staff ; to the doormen were all exceptionally cordial and friendly. </s>
<s> rooms themselves are fantastic ; perfect for a business person there for a stay or for a family there for recreation. </s>
<s> new Serenity beds that the Hilton offered were to die for ! One of the most restful nights sleep i have had in years ! The kids loved the Ipod docks in the rooms and my wife and I loved th fact the kids could keep their bedroom ice cold like they like it and we could keep it warmer in ours. </s>
<s> usual ; it had wifi ; which was ultra cheap and very very fast. </s>
<s> all i highly recommend The Palmer House Hilton ! The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago is a wonderful hotel. </s>
<s> had the opportunity to stay there on business and wished I could have stayed for longer. </s>
<s> staff is so nice and helpful. </s>
<s> really treat you like a VIP and are there to help with any questions you might have. </s>
<s> rooms are so beautifully decorated that you wish you could hire their designer to do your home. </s>
<s> my room I had access to my own personal dvd and cd collection. </s>
<s> I say IN the room ? I did n't even have to leave or order something on the television. </s>
<s> was nice to shower with their AVEDA products and get into my microfiber robe and slippers that they supplied me. </s>
<s> staying in for the night I was also able to use my laptop in my room since they have wifi throughout the hotel. </s>
<s> bed was very comfortable and everything was so clean ! In the morning I was treated to a great complimentary breakfast and ordered a massage. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ordered. </s>
<s> came to my room and I did n't even have to leave. </s>
<s> comfy ! This hotel was by far the best that I have stayed in and I travel a lot for business so I would know. </s>
<s> always have high expectations when you 're staying at hotels and I 'm pleased to say that my expectations were far exceeded. </s>
<s> 'm recommending this hotel to everyone I know that will be staying in the Chicago area. </s>
<s> will definitely be back and make reservations for a longer stay this time because I just did n't want to leave ! I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5 stars. </s>
<s> entering my hotel room at The Palmer House Hilton I immediately turned my nose up at a foul odor coming from the bathroom. </s>
<s> placing my bags on a poorly made bed I walked into the bathroom to find the last visitor had failed to flush the toilet. </s>
<s> immediately called room service and asked for a new room. </s>
<s> apologetically told me there were no other rooms available but would send someone right up to handle the mess. </s>
<s> oh around a half hour of waiting a very angry maid knocked at my door. </s>
<s> seemed very irritated to have to deal with the mess and looked at me as if I should have been the one dealing with it. </s>
<s> the room was cleaned up she turned to me as if asking for a tip. </s>
<s> hesitated and she angrily stormed out of the room. </s>
<s> thought things would run smoother and tried to relax with an ipod. </s>
<s> you can use your ipod in the room however what they fail to mention is the constant white noise because the signals are so poor. </s>
<s> nothing could compare to the remote control heating and air. </s>
<s> I was able to get the buttons on the remote to work the temperature seemed to change on its own. </s>
<s> I wanted hot air it would slowly get colder and vise versa. </s>
<s> giving up on a nice television program I decided to retire to bed. </s>
<s> sheets ? Right ! All I can say is I found myself early to check out and in a new hotel within the next hour. </s>
<s> you value your back do not rent a room from this hotel. </s>
<s> Chicago : Do n't let the shiny bright lights of the windy city fool you. </s>
<s> hotel does not provide the luxurious experience or stay as you might expect. </s>
<s> ; the provided appliances and room gadgets are of relatively low quality. </s>
<s> example ; the window curtain for a small bedroom window nearly broke off it 's support after trying to open them for a city view. </s>
<s> bedroom bed ' King-sized makes rattling noises on every turn of the body you make. </s>
<s> coarse ; this is n't too bad once you fall asleep ; until then ; it sucks ! In regards to room services ; the hotel workers are not all that friendly. </s>
<s> talk to you in a stubborn way ; as if they just want to get it done and over with ; just to get their pay-check. </s>
<s> they do all basic room service orders ; but it is not all too friendly. </s>
<s> ; this hotel has it 's much noticeable flaws on top of the positives this hotel has ' which is a bare minimum. </s>
<s> that being said ; I would not recommend this hotel for anyone around the downtown Chicago area in need for at least average hotel services. </s>
<s> ; if sub-par service and quality is okay for you ; then this hotel could be suitable ; however ; considering it 's prices ; you are better off looking elsewhere for hotel rooms. </s>
<s>  </s>
