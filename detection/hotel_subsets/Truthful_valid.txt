1,0,Overview: --Overrated hotel in a premium location. The Great: --Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants; bars; and sights. The Good: --Inviting lobby; pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby; in particular the night deskman. --Nice bathroom; comfortable bed and desk chair. The Mediocre: --Room (excluding bathroom) was underwhelming in design. --No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray's across the street. --Free cocktails 5-7pm in "lounge" is right idea with wrong execution; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. --Hot water (or lack thereof) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. Pressure is pretty low. --View - mine wasn't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. The Bad: --Free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day; even when my computer wasn't moved - really aggravating. Same deal for my iPhone. I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. --No blackout curtains! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning (not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night). Never had this issue in any hotel or motel I've ever stayed at. --Noise! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling; bar music; trucks; car horns; and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. --TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel. And the remote was useless. --In room bar had standard inflated prices but the $7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting. Don't even think of opening it; there's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. Summary: --Not recommended. Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is. Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star.
1,1,We brought our giant rottweiler and she had a great time. Small rooms; but this is normal for the chicago hotel scene. Lots of interesting amenities in the room. Convenient to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping. Really loved the lobby -- a great place to hang around or wait for someone. Lots of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere. Watch out: The concierge (like all concierges at big hotels) will direct you to mediocre; large restaurants where they get kickbacks. We have stayed here several times and I always check for rooms here when I travel to Chicago. However; the hotel is often full so book early.
1,1,I stayed at the Fairmont during a professional conference. While I have to say that for a conference; some of the meeting rooms were too small; in terms of traveler's comfort the hotel is exceptional! I can't think of a single thing about my room that wasn't perfect. The accommodations were luxurious and the hotel is conveniently situated within walking distance of many Chicago attractions.
1,1,After reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed. I booked through their web site about 2 1/2 months prior to arrival for $170/night plus tax for a room with 2 queens. The location was perfect - right by the river near Michigan Ave. - minutes walk to the El; Millenium Park; the Theater District and Shopping. The room was clean; a little larger than standard and nicely decorated. We had window seats in the room with a view of the river. There was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening. To top it off; the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area.
1,0,I have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood; cost and amenities. The hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open; you wouldn't know it. You need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock. The beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a "nicer historic hotel." I will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime. It was a very frustrating experience.
1,1,I only stayed out with my boyfriend for one night; however enjoyed my stay. The staff was friendly; the room was nice and clean; the hallways and ballrooms etc were elegant. Room service was quick and had good options to choose from that actually tasted great. The staff was able to extend our check out time for an extra 1-2 hours without an extra charge to the room. Great location too! Walking distance from the Art Museum; Millennium Park; Grant Park (right across the street) and a quick cab ride to McCormick Place. If I were in the city again I would love to stay there again.
1,1,The Hard Rock is glossy and sexy; but an absolutely fantastic hotel.... I was in town for business and stayed here because of it's location; but I absolutely understand why tourists would like it...right on the river; cool art deco building and Millenium Park is just down the street. Regardless- the room was clean; the staff was friendly; but NOT annoying and the bar was fun. I was comfortable having a couple of drinks alone at the end of the day - they were GOOD! I'll definitely try it again!
1,0,I have stayed in hotels all over the world; and this is probably the worst service that I've ever experienced. The staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would. I decided to try the Monaco because it seemed interesting; was close to the theater; and had what seemed to be a good rate. What a huge mistake. The front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful. The room was not clean; the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving; they never bothered to come turn down the beds; and the late check-out "priviledges" which were guarenteed when I booked the room suddenly became "upon request" - boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful. Dont' waste your time or your money here. At best; it's nothing special. Personally; I like the Fairmont in Chicago; but anyplace woudl be better than the Monaco.
1,0,I can't recall another time I've had to deal with such rude front desk help. While pleasant initially; as soon as I demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that I was still waiting to claim my luggage for check-in (I arrived prior to check-in time; so they were holding a few bags); the true quality of this establishment surfaced. Never mind that the luggage wasn't sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 7:30pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop. While that was a bit annoying; the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of Donna; the very attractive but aloof front desk employee. Her lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness; as I noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay; including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning. I also booked a rate that included parking; which Donna acknowledged at check-in but at check out billed me separately; I assume after I got on her bad side. Even with my last polite good bye to the front desk; I felt a phony; uppity attitude from Donna; and I really can't convey the extent of how insulting it felt. I can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to Chicago. The hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy. Great location as well. To be fair; most of the staff seemed very friendly; and I am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier. But I think most travelers; like me; would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service; so as to not have a "situation" that could single-handedly ruin a travel experience. Unfortunately; that was the case here.
1,1,This hotel was wonderful! I am a college student who went with my mom for the weekend and we both liked it! Pros: THE FRONT DESK and THE STAFF!!! -Helpful: Knew great places to eat and HOW to get there Breakfast: Pastries; coffee; tea; muffins; etc: Fresh Drinks + hors d'oeuvres: Yummy!! Rooms -Clean -Well decorated Lots of people of different ages stayed there Cons: Very very very far from the museums
1,0,From checkin to departure a poorly run hotel. It took 30 minutes in line to check in because only one clerk was on duty. Another person; perhaps the manager; was in the back room but never came out to help the check in clerk even as the line grew. The hotels elevators are small resulting in 10 minute waits to get up and down floors;especially when 1 of the 3 breaks; as seems to be frequent occurence. After specifically asking for a room away from the elevators; I was assigned to a room directly across from them; necessitating another 20 minute wait in line. The room smelled of mildew and water dripped from the ceiling the first night. I requested a news paper be delivered to my room - it appeared on the morning and never again. Basically; the hotel is understaffed and poorly trained. Never again !
1,0,me (taking a cue from david dancer): 'sup? front desk person: yes? me: so; do I have to wait in the elevator line to get up to my room? front desk person: what room are you in? me: **** front desk person: oh. ...i'm afraid so. OR; you can take the other elevators and take the fire stairs up to the 10th floor. me: oh? wtf! so; we're staying at this hotel; and there is a bar on the 29th floor; but we have to wait 15 minutes in line to get to our fucking hotel room? get bent! we're paying to stay here; not just drinking in your bar!
1,1,The Ambassador East is located in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago. It is just a few blocks from the train station; so it was easy to get anywhere in town. The hotel is a National Historic Landmark so the lobby is elegant and beautiful. We loved the Pump Room bar with tons of B & W photos of celebrities. The service was wonderful and everyone was friendly and helpful.
1,0,Very centrally located in the Loop directly south of the 7th Day Adventist Church (my room looked down upon Wacker Drive; the aforementioned church and the Chicago River. Small room; virtually no storage space. Attended a conference with the Monaco as venue. They provided adequate service; with no problems. This was the first time I spent with a Kimpton Hotel and I registered for their Frequent Stay program. I never felt comfortable in this hotel. I'm 60 yrs old and it appears the clientele they target is half my age. Rude front deskperson of unidentifiable gender. The young people can have at it. I'll stay at the Marriott Michigan Ave next time.
1,0,My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool; one white phone and one emergency red phone; to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back.
1,0,The room was very spacious with very nice; colorful decorating. The beds felt like lying on a cloud; and there were four pillows on each bed; two fiberfill and two down so you could choose which you like better. The bathroom was very nice also. Overall; I was very pleased with the stay. You had to show your room key to get in after ten p.m. I thought that was a good security issue. It has a great location too; close to downtown. I would recommend it. The decorations were very classy. Most hotels have two of the same framed art; boring bedspreads and lumpy pillows. The Hyatt Regency was just the opposite.
1,0,This was a refreshing change from the ordinary. I loved the location; the service and the amenities offered by this hotel. The room was charming with a window seat and a water view. The decor was unique but cheerful. Free wireless internet services were a plus here. The staff was helpful and attentive. We loved having goldfish share our room! I would definitely stay here again.
1,1,Chicago is one of our favorite cities to visit. Some friends suggested trying The Talbott. I'm delighted we took them up. The Talbott is a great "small" hotel a block and a half off of Michigan Avenue near the Four Seasons; Drake and Westin. The concierge staff was most helpfull. Gene and Stephanie took great care of us. The rooms were spacious and very fresh. The elevators could be a bit slow at times. Aside from the construction next door; our stay was perfect. Bice now runs the hotel restaurant. We enjoyed having breakfast there. We will stay there again.
1,0,Over-hyped and over-priced. The fact that they have a complimentary wine reception every night at 5 doesnt take away from the fact that they have terrible beds and the place isnt as clean as it should be for a 4 star hotel. The hallways smelled like a dog parlor and the carpets in my room look like they hadn't been cleaned...well; ever. The decorative pillows on my bed were so filthy they were actually stained brown and looked like they had been sitting outside for everyone to use and then put back on my bed. The decor of the hotel was nice and eclectic but it wasnt enough to convince me to ever stay here again. The bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have every tried to sleep on. I couldnt sleep the whole week that I stayed there. It was hard and lumpy and the pillows were tiny. my final say is that it is an over priced Holiday Inn.....
1,1,I recently stayed at this hotel with my family (10-1 / 10-3). We had a terrific experience. I landed the hotel through Priceline for $80 per night and paid an additional $75 per night for a suite on the 41st floor. My two young boys loved it as the view was unbelieveable and the pool on the 42nd floor was easily accessible. I found all the employees that we interfaced with to be very friendly and accommodating. I would love to stay here again.
1,0,HI HO HI HO; off to Chicago we go. Here's the skinny; if you're hoping to run into a washed up rock star (CeCe Deville for us; and no the teenagers had no idea who he was) you may want to spend your hard earned money here. I took my younger sister and a couple of her friends (teenagers) for an overnighter in Chicago on our way to Wisconsin. I chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance. I mean come on it is supposed to be "COOL". Well it wasn't. The Positives: *It is in the Carbon & Carbide Building; which is beautiful. *The location: it sits in the middle of everything *The lobby has two computers for guest use. *The fitness center is very nice. Cardio machines have individual TV's and there are head phones in case you forgot yours. They have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack. *Check-in and out was quick and Valet was very courteous. The Negatives: *The rooms were small and ours wasn't clean (pistachio shells on the floor). The rooms were painted purplish gray (we were on the Prince floor) with a picture of Bob Marley hanging on one of the walls. The girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows. *Bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub. *The cable reception was poor; I kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture. *It isn't anywhere near the Hard Rock Cafe. *There was very little memorabilia. *There is no pool; and yes I knew this when I made the reservation. To wrap it up; I won't be staying here again. If I am going to drop almost 4 Benjamins on a hotel room; I will stay at the Palmer House Hilton. But that is a whole different review.
1,1,We stayed at the Sheraton by Navy Pier the first weekend of November and were very pleased with the accommodations and the service. We were upgraded to club level rooms and stayed in 3114 and 3115 adjoining. The view from both rooms was spectacular (as you can tell from the picture attached). They also left a plate of cookies and treats in the kids room upon check-in which made us all feel very special. The hotel is central to both Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. so we walked; trolleyed; and cabbed all around the area. We ate the breakfast buffet both mornings and thought it was pretty good. The eggs were a little runny; but they happily made a different batch for us at the omelet station. Our six year old ate free and our two eleven year olds were $14 (instead of the adult $20) The rooms were clean; the concierge & reception staff were both friendly and helpful...we will definitely visit this Sheraton again when we're in Chicago next time.
1,0,Apart from the location; great; but it stops there. Upon check-in; I was informed I would have a queen bed. I asked for a king size bed; and I was told there would be a charge for going up to a king. GIVE ME A BREAK; a surcharge for going from a queen to a king. When I got up to the room; it was like a oven. I could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service. Everything in the room had a charge associated to it; even down to the coffee; $1.00. Now what's up with that? I was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom. Very small. I have stayed there twice and with so many other options; I feel this will be my last.
1,0,Upon first entering the hotel; we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful bellmen I have ever encountered. Through our 2 week stay; they told us to "have a nice day" as we left in the AM and welcomed us back upon our return. Breakfast is served in the AM; and the servers were as delightful as the bellmen. It was a very enjoyable stay.
1,0,I stayed in this hotel for 5 days in November together with my colleagues. Internet only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day. No fridge or microwave included in the price. Our room had two too soft full size beds. In the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall. Who doesnt believe it; check out the 16th floor close to room 212. With discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous. I stayed in the Hyatt Regency before for much cheaper and that was way better. The restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty; but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served. please stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby.
1,1,We stayed for just one night ;but the hotel staff was extremely friendly and polite. The rooms were clean and large. The decor had just been redone. The best perks were the complimentary continental breakfast on each floor in the morning and the free cocktail hour with premium drinks and great appetizers at night. We got a great rate and would go back. Great location for walking around.
1,0,where do I start. The GM was a nice guy for handling the incident I had. Anthony -the Concierge - set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable. Anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice. He set me up and quoted me a price of $125; When i got to the spa (which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon) i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was $100 with 20% off. At the end of the massage I gave the lady $100 and said thanks you can keep the change; She insisted that I got "A Hotel Rate" because Anthony set me up. She called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference - $45. She then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I declined. In short - shady dealings with this place. I was quite taken back. The GM Selman comp'd me a night but ; I felt swindled big time. Stay somewhere else. The concierge has something going on...
1,0,We stayed at Amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more. It's a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but it's just not worth the money. It does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast. The sheets though; made us itch for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things. The breakfast could really benefit from some bagels or yougurt. Otherwise; it's just an early morning sugar attach of muffins; danishes; sweet breads; and croissants. There are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain variety; if you are into that sort of thing. Also; the windows do not open and there is a climate control device in the room. The problem with it that it keeps blowing air all the time; alternating between cold and warm; right over the bed. There is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale. They do have a business center where you can send fax and use internet for free. The problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there. One person at a time... All and all; we will not stay there again. If we feel like luxury; we have to find some other place. But if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city; maybe we will try Red Roof Inn or something like that. At least we'll know what we are paying for.
1,0,Stayed for a week last month. Can't beat the location - close to the Magnificent Mile; Attractions; Tours; Great Restaurants & Night Life. Have spent a lot of nights in other Homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels. Thought the room was ok; not great. Overpriced in my opinion. Found staff to be uninterested and not very helpful. Had to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less. Watched during the week as other guests were made to wait as well. Breakfast was the same stuff day after day. As the week went on; they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished (weekly delivery I guess). Also; the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant. Travel for work (sales) and frequently stay in hotels. Travel with family every year and also stay in hotels. This is roughing it for me...not a camper. Would come to Chicago again; but would not stay here. There are too many other options worth investigating.
1,0,I have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok. The main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center; which is truly annoying. In addition; there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator. Other than that; it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm. But; the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable. The door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk; and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed. There was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed; so they shoved it off to the side. Room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel. It should not be sold as a hotel room.
1,1,I just enjoyed a 3-day weekend at the Swissotel Chicago. A friend of mine booked it and got a GREAT rate. Cheaper than even a fleabag motel. So keep an eye out for specials. The view was great; the location was prime. The staff was helpful. The room was large (we had 2 double beds). I only have one complaint. Our room was next to some sort of storage or mechanical room where employees (I think) would sneak off to talk on the phone. The sound came right though the vent in our bathroom and we could hear them plain-as-day. Fortunately; the sound was only in the bathroom so it wasn't like it kept us up at night. It was just a little weird. Overall; a great stay and I will definitely stay there again.
1,0,I am staying here now and actually am compelled to write this review before I fall asleep. The front desk staff were brief and one of them was chatting with her friend (gossiping) as I checked in (VERY unprofessional). The room she offered me was on a 'high' floor (5th.... HA) and when I checked in there was a big bag of grapes left behind by the previous guest on the window sill and some of the previous guests hair in the bathtub....I was DONE. Called down and had them re-clean the room; they made no offer to compensate or upgrade...not even a bottle of wine. The front desk clerk suggested I come down and get a key to another room (like I have time for that). Disappointing as I do like Kimpton hotels and am a Kimpton In Touch member (btw they've done away with the amenities...you just get a free item from the mini bar).
1,0,If location is the only thing that matters; stay at the Talbott. However; my wife and I have travelled extensively throughout North America and Europe; and I have never; in my entire life; seen such an inept housekeeping staff. They are unprofessional; noisy; incompetent and better suited for a one star hotel. They were yelling in the halls; slamming doors; and taking far too long to clean each room. They come to your room several times to check the fridge where they sell bottles of water for $3. The hotel was being renovated when we were staying there so we also had to endure the construction work - no discount was offered even after we complained several times. The front desk staff was very polite; but who cares?They're supposed to be nice. I spent a lot of money to stay here and did not feel that I received a fair deal. The room was sub-par for the price; even for an inner city hotel. Stay somewhere else and have a better vacation.
1,0,Rude; rude; rude! We stayed here on July 4th weekend. We drove from Michigan; we called customer service to get directions from I-95 w/c is a major highway to Chicago-- calling them from a cellphone; telling them we're in a middle of a storm and that we're lost....we were put on hold; forwarded to another person who did not know how to get to the hotel and we were on hold again. Giving up we decided to just exit the highway and try our luck at a 7-11 store. When we finally arrived at the hotel at 2 am no one was there to take care of our car so we looked for parking ourselves. Checking in we were not greeted by anyone; even the receptionist did not greet us!! no welcome to the knickerbocker; nothing! The man at the reception was rude; which makes me think what kind of customer service training this hotel has. The guy could not find our reservation and he seemed frustrated that we are checking-in at 2 am!! Well if they were able to give us directions maybe we would have been there 2 hours earlier. The room is not even spectacular; very small; probably a little bigger than a walk-in closet. Stay here at your own risk.
1,1,I travelled to Illinois from the UK on business; and booked Friday and Saturday night at the Homewood Suites so that I could have a weekend in the city. The location was perfect; walking distance to Michigan Ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff; and literally 100 yards to the L (red line) for getting out to the surrounding areas. The room was great: not exactly 'wow' decor but clean and really well stocked. I was expecting a 'suite' to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area. It was actually a 3-room mini-apartment; with an open lounge/kitchen; bedroom; and bathroom. Two flatscreen TVs and a huge bed. Breakfast buffet eggs and bacon were great for the hangover(!); and the kitchen meant that I could cook up some lunch rather than eat out if needed.
1,0,Overall I had a VERY Bad experience when hosting a meeting for company; but when my parents came in from out of town and wanted to stay at the Swissotel; I thought we should give them another try. Turns out my first impression was correct; this is the LEAST friendly hotel I've ever been in! Even the concierge was rude and disagreeable. I could go on and on; but instead I'll just say GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!
1,1,We booked this hotel for the second leg of our Chicago stay..it was great!!!! The Lion King package was pricey but reasonable; given the ticket costs and the Suite. Room was great....classical music greeted us when we entered our room after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. NYTimes and Chicago Tribune at your door every morning. One block from the Washington El train station. We never saw the small rooms that every one apparently doesn't like; but the Suite rooms were fun and our kids loved it. Dunkin Doughnuts and Corner Bakery down the block. City Hall; Picasso structure....this was a great place. Book it and also use the Golden Touch Limo service...reasonable. Omar is a super guy.
1,0,I can see how this place must have been gorgeous at one time but they really need a makeover. 1. There was a huge gaping hole in the carpet on the bedroom floor. I kid you not. How can they have guests in a room where the carpet looks like it had been mauled by a giant earthworm? 2. The furniture was severely chipped. Ok. I dont mind chipped furniture if I am slumming it in my just-out-of-college-sister's apartment. But for 170+ a night; I want a room that does not look like it was furnished with stuff retrieved from a dumpster drive 3. The receptionist while I was checking in was super curt. I know it was late but isnt that sort of your job? Not everything was horribly bad though. The one star is for the bathroom that was super clean. I do not recommend this place at all.
1,1,I love this hotel. It is one of the best that I have stayed in. The lobby was beautiful and the room was nice and comfortable. The made services was terrific. No matter what time we left the room it was made up when we came back. I asked the maid for a couple of extras and she was very nice and friendly. That is what I liked about the hotel the staff was so nice and friendly. I was there with my daughter for a girl's weekend from Thursday - Sunday. Everyone from the doorman to the concierge to the people at the desk etc. was wonderful. I can't say enough good about this hotel. Yes the bathroom was small; but I wasn't moving into the room. I was just staying there a few days and was hardly in the room anyway. I will definitely stay there again
1,0,I recently stayed at the Sheraton for an onsite conference; and had problems from the getgo. I had problems with the check-in even though I had made arrangements beforehand to pay by company check and they have a credit card on file. The front desk clerks were kind of rude. The room was okay; not worth what I paid for. The sheets were kind of messed up and the room didn't feel very clean. They also charge for internet access; which is ridiculous. Most hotels provide free wi-fi. The conference food; which I assume is catered by the hotel; was not good at all. On the day of the check out; I had arranged for a late check-out; but in the morning before check-out time; someone else got assigned to my room and was attempting to get in! Then they locked me out of my room with my luggage still in there before my check out time. All in all; I would recommend staying somewhere else.
1,1,Having had a great stay at the Monaco last Fall with friends; I was disappointed (initially) to arrive on Saturday with husband and find that they didn't have our Quikbook made reservation in their system and they had no rooms available for Sat. eve. BUT they immediately took responsibility for their mistake by doing the following: found us a nice room at the neighboring Swissotel and paid for it! Gave us cab fare to get the 4 blocks over there. Paid for our valet parking $33 that eve. So naturally when they asked if we were interested in returning for Sunday eve (when they did have room); we said yes. When we returned; they gave us a corner suite with jacuzzi tub for our $139 quikbook rate! Now that's what I call a recovery!!
1,0,Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay. This hotel's five-star rating needs a downgrade! When I visited this hotel 14 years ago; The Fairmont was among the classiest brands. No more. My 29th floor room was expansive; but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working. The upholstery was frayed; the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water; and the room's door didn't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. Worse; the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you; with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. It was like sleeping in an old vending machine; but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message; there was none to be found. Other reviewers remarked that this hotel "needs updating;" but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame. For instance; someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations. I couldn't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space wouldn't accommodate my legs. (I am not unusually tall.) There are so many great hotels in Chicago that deserve five stars; that the Fairmont shouldn't be able to compete. See my profile for better ideas. Niftyc
1,1,We loved this hotel and would definitely come back. Initially we weren't given a goldfish; which was disappointing; but then we left a tip for the housekeeper; and she rewarded us with one. We had fun sipping wine and playing Wii in the lobby every afternoon. The staff were quite friendly and helpful; even printing our boarding passes for us. Our room was very comfortable; with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper. At first we were worried about noise; since our room was next to the elevator; but we hardly heard it; and didn't notice any street noise either. The hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated; well-lit; and ideally located.
1,0,Let me first start by saying I have always been pleased with the Conrad hotels and that is why I chose the Conrad Chicago. I was very disappointed in the level of service. 3 phone calls to get maintenance to fix the bathroom sink; unpleasant experience in the Terrace resturant; front desk not aware of room eminities; and a very uncaring MOD! All the Conrad hotels I have stayed at have been 5 STAR but not this one. I have to give it 2 stars!!!:(
1,1,We just returned from a weekend at the Palmer House. We normally stay north on the Mag Mile but wanted to be closer to Soldier's Stadium and the Art Insitiute this time. We were able to upgrade to a suite upon arrival at half the price that we paid for a regular room at the Four Seasons two weeks earlier. What a suite!! It was huge. The basic living room; dining room and kitchen/wet bar area was one large room. Up to three additional bedrooms can be added by the use of connecting doors. All rooms were spotlessly clean. They even smelled good. Lovely soaps; robes; etc. Lots of large closets. The bathrooms were older but well maintained. Much better than the ones at the Four Seasons. The furniture was nice but worn in some spots. The beds and linens were excellent. Room service was fast. The food and service were great. The pool and workout areas were clean and well maintained. We had one small problem with a burned out lightbulb in one of the lamps. Maintaince arrived quickly with a new bulb. They wouldn't allow me to tip them!! Check-in was somewhat slow as the hotel has been sold out for several weeks. This is a very large hotel; so they have to move a lot of people and rooms. Also; the hotel does not have views as it is configured like an "E". All in all; the Palmer House is a good value for the money.
1,1,This is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of US cities. The entrance and lobby of the hotel indicates its class. The bedrooms are large and comfortable and the customer service is second to none. It is located on South Michigan directly across the road from Grant and Millenium Park. It also has a free shuttle to the Water Tower in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. For Blues fans; Buddy Guy's Legends Club is situated immediately behind the Hotel. Highly recommended.
1,1,Booked this on priceline for an insanely low price of $65 a night. The BF and I were amazed when we got there--the person checking us in was friendly and helpful to suggest some local nightspots and the room was gorgeous! A nice upscale; downtown feel and super comfy beds. We had a fabulous view from the 25th floor that inlcluded a sliver of Lake Michigan; a sliver of the Taste of Chicago crowds; and some friendly office workers in the builiding next door who waved to us a few times. Seriously. We had a pretty anonymous experience the rest of our stay--which was fine with us. The hotel consists mainly of 2 towers and is like a huge; sprawling city inside. But we weren't there to stay in the hotel room the entire time...we like to get out and explore as much as possible. The location was fantastic. Easy walking distance to Michigan Avenue and the rest of downtown. We walked for blocks well into the night and never felt like we needed a cab. I also highly recommend the Urban Cruise on the river (the entrance is right across from the hotel)--we saw some amazing architecture from the boat and got to cruise Lake Michigan a bit too. Don't park your car here if you don't need to--it's very expensive. Park downtown or ditch the rental car--you won't need it anyway; you can walk to tons of stuff or grab a cab. Love Chicago and totally recommend this hotel!
1,1,Stayed for 3 nights. booked via hotwire; upgraded to historic tower. Got a big room; with a nice view.Service was great. Valet parking was efficient; but you expect it for 53 doller/night. But the location was the best
1,0,We stayed at this Hotel in February 2010. The room was great we had purchased it at a raffel at work for a fund raiser for United Way. So we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity. We were woke up at 3:00am in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor. Of course one of the rooms they rented was right next to ours. They were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on. We called the front desk who sent security up immediately. Security tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave. We called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down. Because of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted. When we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate. Well we still paid for it!!. They would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had. We would never stay at this hotel again; obviously they really don't care about their guests.
1,0,Used this hotel the first time I was in Chicago. For the prices and for being classified an intercontinental...I wouldn't consider it that good. The rooms were solid. The view was ok (but so is it virtually everywhere else on Michigan Ave.) The service was ok. The prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else. We came here for a Jewish/Hindi wedding. Appetizer was fine. Main entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else. Dessert was inedible. I have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it. I personally preferred the Conrad. Better prices and better service.
1,1,The reviews we read were a bit mixed; but I thought it was excellent. I've stayed in The Splendido; Villa D'Este and others and it doesn't compare; but nor should it. It doesn't claim to be in that space. I expected it to be a notch off the Four Seasons and so it proved. A only a small notch too!. Lovely clean and bright room. Superb views; very quiet; comfy bed etc. Excellent service all round and nice staff. For the money and quality it stacked up very well indeed. Couldn't really fault it any way given it was half the cost of the Four Seasons but pretty close in terms of overall experience. We will go there again when in Chicago. Great location too.
1,1,Stayed at this hotel with 3 friends or 4 nights. The hotel was clean and tidy; throughout. The Concierge Christopher was excellent and helped as with all our needs; gave us discount vouchers etc. Hotel was in excellent position. 3 blocks from John Hancok Building and more importantly The Cheesecake Factory ; Bloomingdales 3 blocks away and the Water Tower Shopping Centre 2 blocks away. We went to the huge I Max cinema which is about ten minutes away. Cant wait to go back to Chicago and The Affinia
1,1,The hotel is beautiful. It is an excellent location. There was a few minor issues. The hotel is clearly geared toward the convention and business crowd. There were charges for almost everything; although I did not incur any of these. Our room was a little small for the class of hotel; but not overwhelmingly small. Not a true complaint; but the elevators were very slow. My comparison was that we stayed in an equally aged hotel in a different city during our trip; and the Intercontinental's were significantly slower. That's it; no more little nit picks. The staff was excellent; the doormen being the highlight. The hotel bar was also very nice. The hotel was immaculately clean. I would definitely travel to this hotel again.
1,0,My family and I stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker Dr. on March 27; 2012. We were excited about the great price we got for your 4-star hotel through priceline. Unfortunately; we were not impressed. In the past; we have stayed at the Hyatt in downtown San Diego for spring break on the Marina; but chose to stay closer to home this year. The room was not clean to our standards when we arrived; even though we paid for an upgrade. We asked for it to be cleaned while we were sight seeing and were assured it would be looked after. Upon our return; nothing had been moved in the room to re-clean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so I can only assume; it wasn't even checked as promised. We only had 3 towels for the 4 of us and had to call for more. They were promptly delivered but room service took 40 + minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice! The curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming; the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it; the honor bar/fridge was gouged and dirty; too! The mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on - not neat and tidy at all....There were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well. Very disappointing to say the least. I have buyer's remorse and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds! We were compensated for our upgrade - $20.00 but given the price of parking; taxes; and etc. at this point I wouldn't recommend this Hyatt to anyone. My husband travels and uses his Hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4-star hotel. I felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility.
1,0,My first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews. For some reason; I kept being disappointed at every turn. Noisy room on the 4th floor. Could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling. BE WARNED - No water; no mini-bar no vending machine; no nothing once you get in your room. You might as well be in prison. They have coffee in the morning; but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days. I guess that is convenient for them; but what about me? Workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest. The only treadmill I could get on was broken. Guess what a cooler with water in it! Oh no - it was only stocked for one day. After that nothing. Way to set expectations and then fail to deliver. Same with towels - one day they have them - next day they don't. They essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $10 charge for wireless (go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free). They should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach. I have stayed at much better for less. Won't be coming back.
1,0,Truly a tattered run down facility that you should avoid . Rooms are small; dirty; and in no way represents the web sites representations. Staff is poorly trained and a very big disappointment. At best it is a 3 star facility ands with so many options in Chicago; "please" avoid this one. I had no choice to stay here as a client booked the rooms.
1,0,They allowed parties to go on all night and booked us in a room with no running water. We called security twice for them to do nothing about the party. When they finally came up about 30 people filed out of that room only to file right back in after about 10 minutes. When we called back nothing was done about it. My 2 year old son was awaken by all the loud music and cursing. THEN we get up the next morning at 7:30 to get ready only to find that we have no running water. After the maintenance man piddles around with it for a half hour we have no time to shower and have to ride the two hour train ride dirty and tired from no sleep. They did not resolve this issue. They just keep passing my complaint to "managers" supposedly. It was the worst stay of my life and my poor two year old had to be there for it
1,0,After reading the Trip Advisor reviews; I was expecting an exceptional stay. I was not impressed overall. The concierge; the view; and the hotel resturant were the highlights. The bed; although not horrible; was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home; and I do not consider myself and extremely fussy person. I was traveling for business; and although not dressed in formalwear; was also not dressed down; but all in all; it felt a bit pretentious to me. There are better options for the money; and would gladly stay at the Sutton Place; Sheraton Towers; or Trump for the similar price and better stay. I would ask Trip Advisor to move it down in the ratings......not #1 in Chicago; in my book.
1,1,My friend and I stayed for just one night; and loved the hotel. It had an awesome water feature in the hotel; and great large bar. Like all Hyatts it had a very comfortable bed; lot's of pillows; and large bathroom.
1,0,I stayed here with a dozen of my friends; and more than half of us got eaten alive by bed bugs! We stayed there from September 28 - September 30th; but the symptoms (i.e. the crazy itchiness) didn't come until Sunday night when we all got home. I complained to the hotel and basically all they're gonna do is cover the cost of our dry cleaning bills. Honestly; they should reimburse us; because it was not worth it at all. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!
1,0,I stayed at the Hilton Chicago last week and was very disappointed. The highlight of the stay was waiting 20 minutes for a bellman to come and get our luggage. Finally; my 72 year old mother; 8 year old son; and myself gave up and dragged it all down to valet parking ourselves - no easy task. The security guard was kind enough to hold the door for me. The valet parking attendants looked over and then ignored us. As far as I could tell; he was just standing there doing nothing. I couldn't let go of the bags without everything falling so I gave my son the parking receipt. The attendant pointed to where our car was parked - no short distance away. My 8 year old had to tell him to pull it up. They should have been ashamed. Less significant; but irritating issues. The pool is part of the Hilton Athletic club. Two lanes are reserved for adults wanting to lap swim. Basically; two adults can take up 2/3rds of the pool while everyone else is consigned to the leftover 1/3rd. This is ridiculous and very family unfriendly. In addition; the pool closes at 9 p.m. What pool closes at 9? We stayed for 3 nights. Not one single additional bar of soap; bottle of shampoo; or coffee stirrers.
1,0,I've been here for 4 days. Great location right off of miracle mile; near all major hotels; best shopping and theatres. Rooms very large. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful; and respond immediately. Problems: there frequently are homeless people (even during daylight) on Superior between St. Clair and Michigan Avenue (the main route you walk for or all activities; and just about everything is in walking distance from here). At night; the street on the north side of Superior is dark; and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors. The street people do not approach you; although they may stare as you go by. Usually 2 or more along the way; where they sleep on the window sills of Neiman Marcus. I would not think a woman would feel safe by herself. (I am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia.) There are homeless up and down Michigan Street; but this is different as it's a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street. The entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work; and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation. For now; expect two extremely small; warm; slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm; cramped hallways! All the walls throughout the hotel need painting; and the wallpaper is peeling in places. In the room; several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection; the carpets were stained; the bathrooms needed new grout (some mold visible); the TV is very small (16 Inch?) and the windows very; very dirty. You won't get your room serviced unless you ask for it; sometimes more than once. The "pub " downstairs is run down; dark and kind of creepy. Food and room service are very expensive; as is parking ($34/day public and $38/day valet). On the plus side; the bed was very comfortable; there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area; plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans St. Clair street toward the north and south. You can see a sliver of Lake Michigan. Pool small; but clean. All in all; it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room; but I think it is overpriced; and I would not stay here again.
1,1,We stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights for a friends reunion. The room was clean and new feeling; nice city view; free bottled water in room upon arrival. Check in was a breeze; and our room was ready even though we were several hours early. All staff was friendly and helpful; excellent breakfast.
1,0,Seriously overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel. The "amenities" were a smoke screen; nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn. I would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase. Being charged $15/day for Internet on top of a $250/night rate was a bit over the top. The bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient. The shower was a nice size with a fantastic over-sized shower head; unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost. The staff were friendly and helpful; actually the best part of the stay were the staff. All in all I found it overpriced for the quality of the room.
1,0,They rave about their beds but the beds were average. On surface room seemed clean; however; dropped my pen behind nightstand and discovered at least an inch of dust. It appeared there had been repairs to something where they had to cut away part of the wall. The repair job was covered up with a wallpaper board over the hole but the board did not even completely cover hole. Impossible to have a decent shower or bath. EXTREME water saving devices on both the shower and tub provided basically a trickle of water. I was unable to get the shampoo out of my hair as pressure was so poor. Also be prepared to be nickled and dimed to death. There was even a $10 charge if you used the coffeemaker in the room; really! For room service they tack on a delivery charge and a 20% gratuity. Since the waiter does not stay to serve you how is he earning a gratuity. I have already been charged for him to deliver the food. The parking fees were outrageous at $51 a night but to add insult they charge a hotel patron the same fees as the general public. Upon packing to leave we realized that the dvd set my son had brought was missing. I reported the theft to the hotel. Had to file a report with security who promised me they would investigate and get back to me within 2 days. It has now been over two weeks. No follow up; no apology even given. We will never stay at this hotel again. We have been to Chicago many times and this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed at.
1,1,We just got back from 3 nights at the Sofitel. We really have nothing bad or negative to say about it. We've stayed at other higher end hotels in Chicago such as the Park Hyatt; The Peninsula; and The Four Seasons - and the Sofitel tops them all. It's a 4 star hotel with 3 star prices. It's a beautiful hotel all the way around. Staff is uniformly friendly without being patronizing. They were helpful with the one small problem we had and solved it quickly. The common areas are fresh and modern in appearance. The room was very clean with comfortable beds and well-appointed marble-accented baths. My wife loved the huge tub. We had breakfast via roomservice every morning and it was always hot and delicious. The robes and Evian at turndown was always appreciated. The property is ideally situated in the middle of the Gold Coast and all the best shopping and eating is within a short walk. Want a Bentley or latte? They're all close by. This was our second stay since it opened and I'm sure it's to be our home away from home when we are in Chicago.
1,0,The location of this hotel is excellent. The hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say - in my opinion. The room decor is horrible (probably more European than I am used to) and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment. On the upside; if you want to stay in a great location; feel safe; and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work. I prefer Westin or Marriott...something that you can count on.
1,0,After reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel; I went ahead and got an Ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness. I normally have a good experience with Intercontinental hotels; particularly the Mark Hopkins in SF. I called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as Ambassador Club. When I arrived at the hotel; there was no separate check-in line (as advertised) and the manager on duty basically ignored me when I told him I was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room. I was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty. They gave me a room in the "modern" tower; (built in the 60's) which was about 2/3 the size of a regular room at the Mark Hopkins (built in '29). I had to deal with torn sheets; cracked marble sinks; and the spare roll of toilet paper being located OUTSIDE the bathroom inside the closet - how convenient is that? The closet door; if you are not careful; may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door. I was not provided with a key to the minibar and I called for turndown service; which never happened. The next day; they finally got around to the fact that I was an Ambassador Club member and entitled to an upgraded room; but since I travel with a medical device which I already set up in the tiny room; I declined. To their credit; they did send some of the amenities I would otherwise be entitled to as an Ambassador Club member. I would not stay at this hotel next time I go to Chicago. There are other better places for the money including; the Omni; The James; The Fairmont; Hyatt; Sheraton; Monaco; Crowne Plaza; even the Holiday Inn and Marriotts located in the same general area.
1,1,This was a great hotel right in the heart of the Chicago Loop. Within walking distance to the downtown attractions. Parking is expensive ($50 p/nt) so we parked at a free remote location (recreation drive) since we weren't planning on driving once we checked in. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and clean.
1,1,We stayed here as an alternative spot for a friend's wedding. The price was about 50% to 65% of what it costs to stay at similar hotels in the area. First the minuses. 1.) The standard rooms are small. if you want a little more space you might want to upgrade. 2.) Since the hotel has been recently rehabbed you can see some of the stuff that the covered or painted. 3.) There really are no views from the hotel. Now the plusses. 1.) The shower is AWESOME. Probably one of the best hotel showers I've seen. Rain shower with wand; great pressure and the enclosure didn't leak like a lot of these shower stalls do. Very nice. 2.) The fixtures and finishes in the rooms were top notch. Very modern and clean. 3.) The bed was great. Better than some hotels that promote their beds. Great nights sleep. Overall. This is a great space for a trip where you are not going to be spending much time in the room. If you were in town for a conference or for work where you will need to spread out your stuff it might not work. Anyone else should really like the experience. All I care about when I travel is having a nice bed and a good shower to relax in after a long day. If you are the same this is a good spot for you.
1,0,Staying here currently. Had aspired to sleep. The paper thin walls allow even the slightest peep from your neighbor to feel like you're right in bed with them. Couldn't sleep anyway because of the cheap; giant fluffy pillows. Called housekeeping; asked for any help...was simply and accomodatingly told; after my plea for help; could they; would they have any ability to supply me with a reasonable pillow? Complete answer before hanging up: "We do not." Hyatt; may your well executed service lead to your demise. Happy
1,1,My sister and I went to Chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because I have a friend who works at Homewood Suites here in Cleveland so we got a discount. The valets were really friendly; you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel. Check-in is on the 6th floor because there are restaurants beneath the hotel at street level. That also made finding the hotel tricky because I expected a groove to pull into and it turned out that I just had to pull over to the right side of the street. The lady at the front desk was friendly and informative. Our room was very clean. The fact that it is an extented stay hotel was nice when it came to bringing home leftovers from restaurants; storing and reheating food. The complimentary breakfast was great! They have real food such as eggs; bacon; french toast; cereal; bagels; juice; milk; and yogurt. The hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a trolley that goes to Navy Pier and passes by Michigan Avenue. They also have free WiFi. Overall; I would definately stay here again and I would recommend it to others.
1,1,The sheraton was a wonderful hotel! When me and my mom flew in we were really tired so we decided to take a quick nap. We didnt want to get up! The beds are absolutely to die for. I wanted to take it home with me. The service was great and this was probably one of the biggest if not the biggest hotel ive ever stayed in. They had a really nice restaurant inside with excellent food.
1,1,I booked this via Priceline; and was not sure I'd like it; as some Sheratons have fallen off the cliff. This hotel absolutely surpassed my expectations. Despite booking with Priceline; I was treated like a king. They let me check in early; gave me a beautiful room; and even went so far as to look up my Starwood number so I could get some credit for the stay. The staff was unfailingly pleasant; the property immaculate; and the room very comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel.
1,0,This hotel has a great location and nice infrastructure. The river north area is full of great restaurants and the north bridge area is great for out of towners. The decor is lovely and a nice hold-over from when this was a Le Meridian. While the Conrad aspires to be in the top tier along with the Peninsula; the Four Seasons; the Ritz and Park Hyatt; it falls short. We and dinner at the Terrace Restarant outside the other day and were initially impressed with the setting and the selection. While the prices were similar to the Peninsula; we figured that it was a nice day and worth a try. Wow; were we ever disappointed. First off; we were told that we could have a seat but only stay until 7. OK; thats fine and we sat down. The waitress made a point to ask if anything was wrong; so that she could make it right. When we indicated that our glasses of champagne were not very full ($20 per glass); she consulted with the manager and then another manager (a heavier fellow in a dark suit). She came back and said that was the standard puor and that she would be glad to bring us additional glasses. What bothers me is not the outcome; but the fact that the management is not service focused. At a Four Seasons or the Peninsula; this would never happen and if we expressed any displeasure; it would be made right. At the Conrad; the Terrace manager just ignored it.
1,1,I stayed for just one nite at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other TA posters but I was not let down. I got the room via PL @ $70 and was first placed in a room on the 8th floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot. Since I had nothing to lose; I asked to be moved to a "room with a view". The front desk attendant( Rasheeda) wanted to make sure that the room I had at first was clean and was in order and I assured her that it was. She then moved me up to the 24th floor with ease and it took about 1 minute. I was quite surprised as I have heard that they treat PL and Hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers. The new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the Navy Pier; a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of Lake Michigan. All this for $70? Yep! I skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious! The room was comfy; had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location. I didnt use it since I wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk. The bed and pillows were very comfy; but I awoke at about 330 in the morning sweating from the comfy but VERY WARM and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed. This was a great deal for the price and I would absolutely stay here again.
1,0,My two girlfriends and I arrived at the hotel; and found the hard rock had lost our reservation. I had just called three days before and had confirmed the reservation over the phone. The rude woman at the front desk treated us like we were lying. It wasn't until I started to cause a scene in front of the line of people checking in that she finally decided that she would research the issue. Ten minuets later she found our reservation. Our room wasn't ready; we were told that it would be ready at noon; we came back at 3 and were told it was still dirty! Room was very small. The bathroom shower; sink and floor were filthy. Room service trays sit in the hallways all day. The next morning we called down to get towels; they were never brought to the room; we had to drip dry. The only positive experience at the hotel was the concierge Christopher. He knew everything about the city and sent us to the perfect nightclub.
1,0,While the parking service was great - the front desk was terrible. We had a huge problem getting ice one night - we had none in our room so we went twice to get some - no one was there to help; called the front desk they promised to deliver some - none arrived so we called again - they said we had to come and get it and would not listen to what we had to say about what had already happened. ...read more
1,1,Stayed at the Monaco for a romantic weekend getaway and it was simply fantastic. Very convenient for walking to museums; shopping and park nearby. The room has a great box window that you can sit in and enjoy the view. We also requested a goldfish which was a pleasant surprise and added to the charm and uniqueness of the hotel. Helpful staff; wifi; Aveda products; decent restaurant downstairs for brunch; easy to get a taxi and nothing beats the location. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel; for business or pleasure.
1,1,my husband and l stayed here after a very hectic week in new york. The room was very spacious and clean; the bed was huge and extremely comfortable. I really liked the Aveda bathroom products; great smell. We had room service the first night and it arrived really quick and piping hot. Compliments to the chef. The concierge was very helpful as we needed to find a few places and we were meeting up with friends and did not know how to get to Navy pier; directions were given to us accompanied by a map. The weekend we were there it was their annual air and navy show; this was spectacular. The whole of the last day of the show we spent at Navy pier and the Millenium park. Location of the hotel is very good for most things especially shopping. If we are ever in Chicago again we will definately stay here.
1,1,Was slated for two nights in Chicago; June 12 - 14; 2007. I could onyl get the Intercon for both nights. I booked a handicapped room since that was they had left. After reading other reviews of the property; I decided to move it from two nights to one; and stay the second night at the Hotel Monaco. Of course; upon check-in; I was given a suite. Nice room; great linens; clean bathroom; and very quiet. Parking is really high ($48). I understand some peopel saying the rooms need to be updated; but everything was clean and worked well. At ;ost; the rooms were a bit dark. I had a late night drink at the bar; which was reasonably priced. i did not eat there; but the menu seemed pretty good; albeit with the typical hotel mark-ups to be expected. In all; I thought the place was everything I needed; and was very happy with the room; the staff; the linens; and the housekeeping. Much better than others have indicated.
1,0,So...the location to the Clark/Lake train stop is great...and that is the only thing that is great with the hotel. The wall are very thin...so much you can hear giggling and early morning housekeeping conversations in the hallway. There is no coffee maker in the room; however; free coffee is available in the lobby...becuase everyone wants to go to the lobby first thing in the morning??? Finally; the "business center" is a pay for use set-up...no courtesty internet usage or printing. Lastly...they bathroom is micro-tiny and lacks in counterspace and comfort.
1,0,All I can say is avoid this place at all costs. From the reservations assistant (who took 45 minutes to book a room) to check out (they billed my card for 750 dollars) and getting a refund (numerous voicemails and emails no one returned my call). AVOID AVOID AVOID a truely hideous experieince I will never stay at a Starwood resort again; and given I stay in a hotel 4 or 5 days a week this is a big statement!
1,1,My husband and I stayed here for three nights while visiting Chicago as tourists. What a beautiful hotel! Our room was lovely; the staff was super helpful and the location was convenient. They don't have an in house gym; but each day you can get a day pass to a cushy gym down the street. The restaurant in the hotel has a very yummy breakfast. The concierge helped us to make dinner reservations at the last minute our first night there. We were able to walk down the Magnificent Mile from our hotel; as well as through the Gold Coast and Old Towne neighborhoods. There are tons of great restaurants in the area (including the famous Gibsons and the Signature Room in the Hancock tower) as well as lots of shopping. There is currently a lot of construction going on near the Talbott (they are building condos right behind it); but regardless we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago.
1,1,I asked for a high floor away from the elevator and that is what I got. The room was pleasantly decorated; functional and very clean. I didn't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt. I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order. It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district.
1,0,We had reservations (guaranteed by credit card) for 2 nights this past weekend. When we checked in the clerk told us that they could not accommodate us for both nights because they were overbooked due to a conference in town. I asked them to relocate us for both nights so that we would not have to move in the morning. They sent us over to another location that they assured could accommodate us. The night manager gave us the address to a different hotel and sent us on our way. Eventually we arrived at the correct second hotel where the staff were expecting a letter from the Sheraton for the transfer - something we were never given. Eventually we checked into this second property and the next afternoon when our keys didn't work we found out that the night manager of the Sheraton had not assured that we could stay both nights at the second hotel. So once again we had no place to stay despite having a guaranteed reservation with the Sheraton. In addition to all of this; we had to pay $24 for parking at the Sheraton to find out that they would not accommodate us despite a guaranteed reservation. I am still shocked by this bad experience.
1,0,It's not a bad hotel. It's just so...disappointing. As a Diamond member; I expect slightly more than a room with two double beds with no view. I'm not distraught over this; but come on. Ditto the continental breakfast in the executive lounge; which has nothing but fattening pastries; bagels and cereal. Low-level Hampton Inns have a free breakfast that puts this to shame. And what's with the lounge not opening until 6:30am? Business travelers often need to be GONE by 6:30; not sitting down to their meager breakfast. The in-room wifi is a pain to access; and I somehow got stuck with the $19.99 plan even though I selected the basic plan. (Don't get me started on how a $89/night Hampton Inn can offer free wifi and a full-service Hilton & Towers seemingly can't...). Finally; what's with the two bathrooms per one hotel room? It's an unseemly waste of space; especially when the rooms are so meager. And the gold-plated bathroom fixtures scream 1992; not 2009; as does the picture-tube TV (vs. flat panel). Overall; this is a huge disappointment over which Conrad should be ashamed.
1,1,This is a stylish hotel located right on North Michigan Avenue; a five minute walk from the Orange "Loop" line that will get you to and from Midway Airport. Forget about taking a taxi: the train is a $2 ride and less than 40 minutes away. Our room (1802) was immaculate and spacious (350 sq ft; we were told). Decorated in grays and white; the room was comfortable and soothing; not jarring. On the other hand; we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading; finding keys; etc. No kidding. The bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp. On the positive side; however; there were Aveda products in the bathroom; the windows were huge; so during the day there was tons of natural light; and no issues with darkness. The king size bed was very firm; but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting. We had a largish TV with a DVD player. There is a safe and munchies. The gym is perfect; equipped with treadmills; ellipticals; bikes and weights. It is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety. There are towels; water; headphones; disposable ear pads; and complimentary green apples. Suggestion: if you are on a floor below the 22nd; take the elevator up to 22nd; then down to L2 to get to the gym. This way you dont have to traverse the lobby. The front desk staff is amiable; and very attentive. I read some other reviews about nasty personnel; but did not have that experience at all. I got a free newspaper with a smile; a free stamp when I needed it; change and all the coffee I could tolerate in the morning. The Hard Rock is located less than a 20 minute walk from the Water Tower; the Drury Theater; John Hancock; and magnificent mile. For those who like a thrifty breakfast; we recommend Gourmet Pantry at 155 N. Michigan Avenue [--]. This deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a Sunday morning; no less: $1.99. The hotel has a breakfast buffet for $15.00 per person; but we did not partake of it. We would stay at the Hard Rock again; and think it is great for people with "tweens." Not sure about the toddler set; though.
1,1,We stayed in a king suite at the Hotel Allegro over Memorial Day weekend. We paid $130/night; and it was definitely a bargain. The suite was huge - living room with a couch; two chairs; desk; large bathroom; bedroom; two closets. The room had recently been renovated; and was very clean. Comfortable bed; friendly staff; great location (near the train and bus); evening wine reception and morning coffee provided. While the Allegro isn't a five-star hotel; it is a great place for the money. (Note: a friend stayed in a non-suite room; and reported that it was very small. Upgrade if possible).
1,1,Stayed here for two days while attending Lollopalooza music festival. One of the best locations in Chicago; on Michigan Ave near the Tribune and Sun-Times buildings. An easy walk or bus ride to many attractions. The King sized room was very nice; not large; but with a generous bathroom. Service was excellent throughout. Check out the awesome swimming pool; straight out of twenties.
1,1,I want to recognize so many people who were exemplary in their service. 1) Sylvia Rollins; Head Concierge. I wanted a fairly last minute reservation at MK restaurant. I spoke with Sylvia on the phone just a few days prior to arrival and within 15 minutes had the desired reservation. 2) Ryan Lettier; Concierge; provided us detailed information on the architectural cruises. Our morning cruise ended up being cancelled by the tour operator and Ryan provided a late check out time to cover us until we could get back to the Monaco. 3) Turndown service was provided as requested and housekeeping in general seemed to be at a high standard 4) Even the bellman went out of their way to ask if we knew how to get the train etc when leaving the hotel. The rooms are tastfully furnished in that whimiscal Hotel Monaco feel. Beds and bedding both very comfortable. The complimentary happy hour and morning coffee/tea service were both very utililzed by the hotel guests.
1,0,Excellent Hotel ! Rooms and service were great. A great value ! I have been to places that are not as good for nearly twice the price. Good location. Close to the L and short walk to rental car service. Restaurants in the area a bit of a disappointment; but the shopping was great. Area recommendations Great theatre; restaurants; museums and shopping.
1,0,Just wanted to let everyone know if you are looking for a hotel with high rise construction next door the Swissotel Chicago is the one for you. My wife and I went there last year and there was just an empty lot next door; this year there is a loud construction site next door. So 8 am Saturday morning you will hear the workers starting. I am sure once the summer in Chicago comes around they will work all night. Just think as they keep adding floors you will be able to look the workers in the eye and wave from your room that used to have a view of the Navy Pier. Now you will get an up close and personal view of people pouring concrete. On top of it the hotel is doing construction of there own. The front of the hotel is block and lucky for us the protestors that are standing in front of the hotel were able to tell use where the new entrance was. The protestors were there because the Swissotel hired a company to redo their sound system that does not hire union workers. If you ask the workers about the noise and they say we can't hear it. I am sure the Swissotel does not want word getting out about this. If you insist on trying it for yourself don't pay for your room in advance they will not let you out of the room and then you are stuck.
1,1,we stayed here in january when it was -20. but even then we enjoyed it so much we could not wait to get back. chicago is a great town to visit and the homewood suites is the place to stay; period. now we stayed from the 9/5/2009 to 9/5/2009 and enjoyed every day. (p.s. the weather was in the high 70s). to get back to the hotel; it was fantastic; it has everything you need and its write in the heart of the city. two seperate rooms were very handy as we had our teenage son. full kitchen; (laundry on 7th floor) seveal foodmarkets within walking distance; everything within walking distance. you wont need a car and at $42 for valet parking you wont want one. dont take my word for it ; check it out you wont be disappointed. oh and did i mention free breakfast and dinner . job done. its a no brainer book now. p.s. theres also a beach within walking distance
1,1,Had to bring my new puppy with me on a business trip and stayed at the Palmer House. The service was wonderful; staff was very friendly towards dog owners; even stopped to tell me how nice my dog was. Easy access to red line from Midway. Valets were prompt at retrieving car (they recommended calling down in advance we did and the car was there waiting).
1,1,I can only confirm the positve reviews previously mentioned. We stayed in room 1112; King with River View. No noise and very comfortable.The price was a bargain at $191 a night. I would stay here again. The "L" from Midway Airport lets you off about two blocks from the Hotel. It's a $2 ride - no need for a $40 taxi ride.
1,0,I have been meaning to write a review of the Omni but wasn't sure if people would believe it as most of the reviews are quite high. We stayed here for 5 nights. The room was fine when I walked in. But about five minutes or so I was all congested. Thought it might have been from the flight. I then noticed there was dust everywhere. The TV; the Minibar; and worst of all the air vent. It was literally hanging off the vent. I called down to front desk they said they would send housekeeping up. After 30 minutes of waiting and noticing other things. A bathroom door that wouldn't close; broken light fixtures; a toe or fingernail on the bed. broken bathroom fixtures. This place was a dump. Hopefully the pictures will show some of it. I could go on and on. Almost 90 minutes later the hotel manager came up to look at the room; Both he and head of housekeeping were "shocked" at the room. We were moved to another room; not as large as this one was because the hotel was completely booked; or so I was told. I stayed at the Omni once prior and have to say was very impressed. But this will be the last time. Sad to say. The hotel did cut the rate of our 5 day stay; but doesn't explain how a hotel of this caliber let a room like this pass any inspection.
1,0,We stay at the Palmer House when we attend conferences in Chicago. It is a stately building. But this year; there were ... problems we have not had before. First; they now have wi-fi available; but it is not free. The cost is $7.50 per hour. On-line it indicated that Hilton hotels charge about $4; but this was almost double. Many hotels have free wi-fi. Wi-fi is wi-fi; so the level of service is not a factor that could justify this exorbitant cost. They also charge for their fitness center; even when you are only going to use the machines. There is no business center in-house for copies; etc. Our bed was against a wall that separated us from the bathroom in the next room. It did not separate us from the bathroom noises. When someone took a shower (at 5:30 a.m.); the pipes "sung" like old pipes do;but very loudly. An empty wine glass sat outside someone's room door for days without being picked up by housekeeping. The concierge desk had only one person and there was always a line. If you called down; you were put on hold while they dealt with the people in the line. The staff were all very nice; and the location can't be beat; but the luxury prices for normal services felt like a ripoff this year. I doubt we'll return....
1,1,We arrived at the Omni on 2nd September for a 6 day stay. I took ill when I left the plane after travelling from Manchester so I saw more of the room than I anticipated. I couldn't go out for 4 days. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was large and very clean. What more could you ask. We had coffee and juice left outside our door every morning at the time we requested. I managed to go to the 5th floor to see the sun terrace (outside the gym) Having a sun terrace in a city hotel is a great idea but the terrace was a bit grim. A few sunbeds on a concrete floor. There was also noise from an air conditioning unit. It could do with a bit of cheering up. What I saw of Chicago was very pleasing; it has something for everyone. Would I go back to the Omni? yes I would.
1,0,We recently stayed at the hotel allegro in chicago illinois; while the hotel was nice please take my advice and do not stay here. I payed cash for the room and handed over my credit card for incedentals ($50.00) the next day my debit card was charged $200 clearly this had to be a mistake...i called the hotel manager who was the rudest person i have ever spoken with about the charge and was told that it was my fault i paid cash and that i could give him my bank account; routing; SS # and authorization code and he could call my bank and take care of it. Clearly i am smart enough not to give this information to anyone yet alone someone who had already taken more then should have been charged. I then called corporate to complain and let them know about the situation the only thing corporate could tell me is that they had already credited my account and that they were sorry and it was clearly my mistake. I then questioned them about the manager asking for all my information if they had already credited my account and they told me they didnt have an answer for me. So for your bank accounts sake do not stay here they are many other options in chicago
1,1,Named my price on priceline. $50.00 Bucks. Hotel room was great. Clean; Clean and new. Fresh crisp sheets; comfortable bed; flat screen TV; clean carpet; nice bath; etc. Short distance to food and sightseeing. I highly recommend this property. Be prepared to pay over $40.00 per night to park. Hey; Its a hyatt. They also charge $5.00 for a bottle of water that is normally a buck. For a total of $100.00 nightly stay in Chicago this place is it just don't drink the bottled water. Happy Travels
1,0,What's not to like? --> Problems getting the room you actually reserved: I had to call this hotel three times and email four times in order to insure that we actually got the room we had reserved. --> Overcharging. They charge for everything here. Wireless. The Fitness Center. The Business Center. I've only run into one other hotel that ever charged for use of the fitness center. Note to the Intercontinental: If you're going to charge for something that is commonly included; you should advertise that fact. What's next? Charging for sheets on the bed? --> Very poor customer service. The staff does not communicate in full sentences; or wait to hear your answer. This is Chicago; not New York. How about a little Midwestern patience?
1,1,The Omni Chicago really delivers on all fronts; from the spaciousness of the rooms to the helpful staff to the prized location on Michigan Avenue. While this address in Chicago requires a high level of quality; the Omni delivers. Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes; the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events; and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in Chicago. Even the "standard" room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights; weight machines; and two rows of cardio equipment. I shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! All in all; a great property!
1,1,We had our hotel reservations at another hotel set and after we were reading all of the negative reviews we cancelled and made out reservation at the Hilton - I am so glad we did the hotel was clean; hotel staff was pleasant and helpful and the beds were amazing. We knew we were paying a little more than some other hotels but it was well worth every penny.
1,1,WOW!! Where do I start? Booked this hotel through Hotels.com for less than I paid for the Travellodge Downtown. Check in was a breeze; the entire staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was huge. The king bed was very comfortable. Our room also had 2 nightstands; 2 chairs with a small table; a desk; and walk-in closet. Even with all the furniture; the room was very spacious. The room did show some signs of wear; but I think this adds to the charm and the rich history of this hotel. The hotel is located in a neighborhood; so it felt like we were staying in a condo or a home rather than a hotel. There is very little noise; however; you are only about 2 blocks from Rush and Division streets; with all the nightlife; and the Red Line at Clark and Division is only 3 blocks away. We decided to walk to Michigan Ave and the next thing we knew; we were at the Hancock building. By staying here; you are away from the noise; but not away from the action. Had breakfast at the Pump Room; which is a story in itself. We had our photo taken in booth 1. Take some time and research who has sat in this booth. It is impressive. Some 1400 photos of celebrity guests adorn the walls of the Pump Room. Didn't have a chance to have dinner here; but I will return for dinner someday. Breakfast was not anything fancy; and a bit pricy; but the history and experience was worth it in my opinion. The waitstaff was friendly as was everyone who worked at this hotel was. I can't wait to return here!
1,1,I stay at this hotel 2 times a year on business and LOVE it! The staff are great; the rooms are spacious and clean; and the location is perfect for shopping and dining on Michigan Ave. Plus if you sign up for Omni Select Membership (for free) you get free wireless internet access.
1,0,We booked this hotel as a last minute vacation planned on doing a little shopping and nightlife downtown. We where woken up at 6:00 in the morning with our bathroom flooded; this water was brown and all the clothing and our belongings left in the bathroom were dirty and sopping wet. We where moved to another room; but it was smaller then the orginal room we had gotten and paid for. The next day the housekeeping service never even came to change our sheets; coffee or towels; which is just horrible service. The service along with the orginal room where perfect; but we do not plan on ever spending another weekend in that flooding hotel.
1,1,This was my first time in Chicago and wanted a hotel that was in a good location. This definitely fit the bill. I could walk to all the places I wanted to see - very close to Michigan Ave and the Magnificent Mile. About a 15 minute walk to the Art Institute. The hotel staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. There was coffee in the lobby every morning; that was very welcome. The room was comfortable and clean and fairly quiet. I could hear the train and some traffic from the street (considering the location; this wasn't bad and didn't affect my ability to sleep or relax). I would definitely recommend this hotel - a gem!!
1,1,My wife and I stayed for 2 nights and loved it. Our stay was booked for us by Virgin Atlantic when we booked our flights from London to Chicago. We were not quite sure what to expect but were reassured by the Hilton brand name. In the event we found that the airline knew what they were doing when they suggested this hotel. On arrrival we got a warm welcome and the check in was quick and efficient. The interior of the hotel is spectacular and looks like has been refurbished to reflect the decor as it would have been when it was built. The room we were given was a good size with 1 Queen bed which was particularly comfortable. The hotel is conveniently located with restaurants nearby. The first night we ate at the hotel's own gourmet restaurant (The Lockwood) which did not disappoint. The breakfasts are also served in this restaurant. We had the buffet both mornings and these were good value for the quality offered. Generally we found the service in this hotel good and the staff very helpful. A nice touch was that when we checked out of the hotel to go to our next destination the car we had booked to pick us up was a few minutes late arriving. A member of staff supervising the doormen saw us looking a bit lost and came over to assist us find the car when it did arrive. Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure stays for both quality and value for money.
1,1,Great place; great room; great location. Even though there was a big meeting going on (Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns) the only consequence for us was slow elevators. Ballroom is amazing; shops on ground floor a nice throwback. Lake views from upper floors -- we were on 17 I think -- are worth it. Concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent. Definitly would return.
1,0,When I called to edit my existing reservation; I was placed on hold for 30 minutes! Finally someone came on the phone and said; "Ill have to transfer you"; so I was put on hold for another 5 minutes. When I finally did get to speak to someone; as I was going through my changes; I asked her to send me a revised copy of the reservation to which she huffed and acted very put off. Before she was able to disconnect with me; I said "I have one more question" to which she replied "I'm working at the front desk and I have customers waiting!" I thought; so am I not your customer? pathetic and rude. Hotel better find some better employees for their guests to truly enjoy their stay.
1,1,My wife and I stayed here in the middle of February 2005. We took the (EL) subway to the hotel from O'Hare. It was very convenient. The lobby was nice and the room was clean and comfortable. I've stayed in many a hotel room; this bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The hotel is located in a great area and close to everything. Walking distance to almost all the interesting sites Chicago has. Would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this great city.
1,0,This was a gorgeous hotel from the outside and in the lobby. However; when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy. Our bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty. Wireless internet is available; but that's an additional fee. Are you kidding? Even the roach motel offers wireless for free! Also; the fitness room was available for only $15 per day. Wow; I thought the room rate was enough to cover that. When I used the coffee supplies in the room; they were not replenished. I called the next morning requesting more and was told that wasn't housekeeping's area but they would send some up. No kidding; nearly 90 minutes later I got the cream and sugar! Glad I wasn't in a big hurry. I'll definitely be staying next door for half the cost and a lot better accommodations the next time I'm in Chicago!
1,0," Barely Average Hotel at Premium Price" This hotel has a beautiful lobby but fails to fails to maintain its standards beyond the lobby. I have stayed in the Conrad in Dublin; Ireland and in HongKong both of which I loved. I was looking forward to staying at this hotel. I was extremely disappointed. I am very surprised that this hotel is allowed to carry the Conrad name. Pros: Elegant lobby nicely decorated with fresh flowers Location: Located in the Heart of Chicago Disappointments - Stained and worn out carpet in hallway - Room was small - Phone and lightbulb in room were broken - Breakfast was $60 for two people; service was slow and impolite - Hotel rationed soaps and shampoo; one bar of soap to share and one bottle of shampoo which was not replaced for two days; I felt like I was staying at a budget hotel. and to cap off my stay the hotel made a billing error which took three months and more effort than it was worth to correct. I would not stay at this hotel again; It just is not worth the premium price they charge.
1,1,Stayed there three nights from 4/17/09 through 4/20/09. Chechecked in about 9:15 AM. Had to wait about 15 minutes because of specials requests I had made. Room was quiet; and comfortable. Marked improvement over last time I stayed there (about 5 years ago). The renovations were great; and maintained the old time charm of the hotel.
1,1,I stayed at the Fairmont Chicago for one night - I'm a frequent business traveler and am very familiar with travel rituals. I checked in late (almost 10pm) due to flight cancellations from my home airport -- Atlanta. I took the shuttle to the airport (best option in lieu of the over priced taxis); and it was my first time staying at the hotel. Upon arrival; I immediately noticed the entrance; which appeared very welcoming and warm to me. I checked in with no problems -- and the desk person even asked if I'd prefer a king or double (reconfirming my reservation preference). I always take the king when I can; and the bed was fantastic! It was suited with great linen and these incredible down & feather pillows named Encompass made by The Pillow Factory -- I checked the tags; since I plan to buy some! I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant - Aria; which they mention they like to be considered separate from the hotel -- and YES; it does stand out all on it's own. The food is Asian fusion; and truly wonderful -- as a gourmand and life-long foodie; I appreciate great food when I taste it! The hotel service was good as well. Only drawback was the breakfast buffet at the restaurant -- seems they need to stick with their dinner theme solely. They missed the mark on relatively simply things like scrambled eggs on the buffet; which tasted a bit 'metallic'. But they made up for it by getting a special order made immediately after I passed on the buffet. I would highly recommend this hotel -- it has atmosphere and a great view (if you can get a room with one); fabulous dinner -- just pass on the breakfast buffet.
1,1,Excellent location; feels like a boutique hotel. Right next to Neiman Marcus (V.expensive dept store) and 2 mins walk to John Hancock tower. As most American ;medium to high end; hotels service was excellent from the bellhop to reception. Upgrade to a suite if you are staying longer than a couple of days as walking around the windy city can be tiring and a suite feels like a small apartment. The pub in the basement is good for a sandwich and a Beer. They will be refurbing so take adavantage of lower rates now as I feel they will be going for very high end clients after the remodelling
1,1,After reading the reviews & getting an excellent rate through travelzoo; I decided to give this hotel a try. I must say it was a great choice! The location is perfect; just off from N Michigan Ave; walking distance from everything. The staff was very helpful and friendly; and the room was excellent. They gave us a corner room w/a great view. As many have posted; the bed & pillows were very comfortable (I am very picky about that). I slept well every night! The renovation is almost done & did not bother us one bit. I highly recommend this hotel.
1,1,This was a weekend trip for my friends and I. We booked a couple of rooms and asked in advanced for the reservations to be connected in some way. Our rooms were right next to one another as requested. As it was almost everyone's first time to Chicago; we had to do a bit of cold-searching for a hotel. And; our choice was next to perfect. I had an amazing time during my first visit to Chicago and it was largely due to this hotel. The customer service was AMAZING. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful. One of our rooms ordered late night room service and raved about how they felt they had ordered a 5 star lunch because it was as fresh as having ordered food at 2 pm; and delicious. My friend suggested they had a full-staff at 3 am because the food came up quickly too. In another of our rooms; housekeeping had accidentally discarded a CD when replacing the CD player with an iPod dock. The concierge had the exact CD purchased and ready at check-out from the neighboring record store. Our rate included complimentary breakfast which was fantastic! Everything was freshly made in their kitchen too. An added bonus was that the hotel is attached to a mall. Therefore; you don't need to leave the building to get a pair of shoes; a coffee; or a some other type of trinket. I was beyond pleased with this hotel and would stay here again without hesitation.
1,0,My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool; one white phone and one emergency red phone; to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back.
