I was recently a guest at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and was immensely dissatisfied.
I arrived to find that they had " lost " my reservation.
They told me they were booked solid even though I had produced my copy of the reservation confirmation.
After nearly an hour of arguing with the front desk clerk she finally asked for the hotel manager to step in.
He was almost helpful.
He searched the database and found that there was a " cancellation " ; however ; it was not for the type of room I had reserved.
I had asked for a suite as I was going to be staying in the hotel for several days.
I was given a box with a bed in it.
They made no apologies for losing my reservation and offered no alternate compensation.
Unfortunately ; I was in town for a conference and everyone in the area was completely booked.
I had no choice but to accept what they had offered.
I begrudgingly accepted this with the intention of contacting the corporate office and posting my review here.
Do not stay in this hotel they will NOT help you with anything ; even if it was their error.
Amalfi Hotel Chicago - We stayed at Amalfi Hotel Chicago last July for a weekend.
It is a contemporary boutique hotel with a perfect location in downtown Chicago.
It is close to most interesting attractions in Chicago area such as museums and shopping centers including Magnificent Mile ; Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue.
We enjoyed every minute of our stay.
The room and its bathroom were clean.
Mattresses were comfortable and staff was polite and very helpful.
We especially enjoyed the great continental breakfast ; which was offered in a nice and shiny hall.
Also this hotel has a good selection of dishes for lunch and dinner.
My only complain is that we had to wait in a queue for about 10 minutes to check in on arrival day but this was minor issue given the great experience we had at Amalfi.
We will definitely stay again at this nice hotel when we are back in Chicago next summer.
We chose to stay at the Hilton Chicago because it was in such a centralized location- everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close ! What I did n't expect was for the beds to be so comfortable.
I ca n't remember when I got a better night 's sleep.
The staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept.
We 'll be returning to the Hilton Chicago the next time we 're in town ! My family and I recently attended a wedding in Chicago and stayed at the Swissotel.
It was much nicer than we expected.
We are used to staying at mid-class hotels and this ; by far ; was one of the nicest places we 've stayed.
The beds were so comfortable and the crib the provided for my infant son was great quality - I was concerned that we would get a rickety 1970s crib ! The bed sheets were so soft that I wanted to take them home ! We will definitely go back to this hotel the next time we are in Chicago.
How should I start ? Well ; after staying at the Ambassador East Hotel ; i realized it was my favorite hotel ever.
The rooms are amazing.
The food is great.
The Pump room bar is awesome.
I love this hotel.
If your ever in Chicago ; the Ambassador East Hotel is the place to go.
This hotel gives you a lot for a reasonable price ! It has a great downtown location and a lot of added bonuses.
We loved the evening cocktail hour with free alcoholic beverages and appetizers.
They also have complimentary breakfast and complimentary dinner.
The fitness center was very clean ; I did n't want to leave it ! Our room was a spacious suite with a kitchen included ! And I took advantage of the free grocery delivery.
Beds are comfortable and the room looks like it was recently renovated.
But the thing that really stood out was the teamwork of such a wonderful staff.
We will be back to the Homewood Suites the next time we come to Chicago ! On our first trip to Chicago ; my fiance and I stayed 2 nights on our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised by the Hotel and the service we received from the personnel.
In the past from other " luxury hotels " we have paid much more and received much less.
Here the room were very spacious ; comfortable and sleek.
We spent come time in the hotel bar ; LE BAR ; and enjoyed a few of their specialty martinis that were second to none ! We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel 's Cafe des Architectes and received service some of the best service in quite some time.
If traveling with a lover we recommend the " Air of Romance " package.
It was the best ! 6 stars ! I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago.
While higher priced ; the reviews online plus four stars convinced me.
Granted the hotel itself is beautiful ; but looks can be deceiving.
The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey.
The restaurant ' Cafe Des Architect had amazing food ; so that was a plus ; but the service was awful.
I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water ! My remote would n't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud.
The hotel must 've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night.
The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently.
I called twice for more fresh towels.
If I wanted this type of experience ; I 'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel.
Same experience ; less money ! If you are looking for a luxurious downtown Chicago experience ; the Conrad Chicago is the place to stay.
The rooms are equipped with the most comfortable beds dressed with the most luxurious bedding ; a 42 inch flat screen television ; a spa like bathroom with marble vanity and soaking tub ; and views of downtown Chicago that will take your breath away.
The hotel has many amenities for you to enjoy while you are there including great restaurants and bars ; high speed internet ; a fitness facility and laundry services.
This hotel was a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality place to stay in downtown Chicago.
When I planned my summer vacation ; I was wanting to travel somewhere new.
Chicago was on my mind because of the fast city life.
I got in a flight to Chicago and arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel.
It was grand and I spent a total of 4 days and nights there.
The luxury was exotic and the location was right around the corner from most shopping and dining venues.
The room service had me drooling because the food was so delicious ; I could hardly picture not feeling satisfied.
I met up with a few of my friends and they offered me a tour around town.
I enjoyed the stay there and will come back sooner than later.
The Ambssador East Hotel - They were out of rooms with king-sized beds when I checked in ; so I was stuck with a small bed in a room with two beds.
I did n't even receive any compensation for the trouble.
I usually rely on the light to wake me up in the morning ; but I made the mistake of sleeping on the bed further away from the windows ; so I woke up late the next day.
The bathroom 's big enough ; but housekeeping does n't replenish the supplies everyday ; which is annoying.
The restaurant 's too expensive ; so I was forced to leave the hotel to get dinner.
I would n't stay here again on my own money.
My wife and I stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it.
The atmosphere was very chic upscale ; in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank.
My wife even got to bring along her dog ' aka ' 1 man !.
I would definitely stay here again would recommend it to anyone staying in the Chicago area.
I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for business ; but extended my stay through the weekend because i loved it ! The accommodations exceeded my expectations.
My bed was very comfortable ; the room was big enough ; and the shower was so relaxing.
I had a great meal in the chop shop and the coffee was delicious at J 's express.
The fitness center was clean ; and inspiring.
I will recommend this hotel to others while in the area.
Overpriced is the best word to describe the Conrad Chicago hotel.
While it may be in downtown Chicago ; the room had no view.
Although I asked for non-smoking ; the room reeked of smoke.
The elevators were very slow ; and one was not working during my stay.
There was a stain on the pillow ; and the leg of one of the chairs in the room was broken.
There was a dead bug in the bath tub.
I was only given 2 towels for my 4 night stay.
My credit card was billed twice ; and it took 2 weeks to reverse to extra charge.
I do not recommend this hotel at all ! I stayed in the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago last week ; and I was extremely disappointed with my experience.
The breakfast buffet was minimal and did not seem to be frequently restocked.
I came downstairs about 30 minutes before the end of the breakfast period to find about half of the food options completely depleted.
Also ; the milk provided for the coffee and cereals was warm ; having been kept out on the counter.
I would have been better off bringing my own food ! Also ; the layout of the rooms is extremely awkward.
I had to move the furniture around to be able to watch TV ; and then move it back before I could make dinner or comfortably use the room in other ways.
I could barely close the door to the bedroom past the corner of the bed.
It just was n't what I would expect from a Hilton-brand hotel suite.
I went to the Homewood Suites in Chicago which is part of Hilton 's famous hotels.
I gotta say that this is the worst hotel that I have ever been to.
In fact ; Homewood Suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet.
I checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape.
In fact ; the rooms looked so bad that I wanted to leave the hotel early.
I also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel.
I saw one of the employees and when I rung the bell for my room ; they ignored me.
How could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you ? One more thing that I hate about this hotel is that the logo did n't look like the actual logo.
It looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw.
I 'll never go to this hotel again and it wo n't even be in a million years for that matter.
This is a hotel that I will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer.
After searching for the perfect hotel for my Chicago getaway I knew once I came across the Hard Rock Hotel ; that this was the hotel for me.
After seeing the exceptional accommodations the hotel offered ; I booked my reservations right away.
When I arrived at the hotel I was astonished at how beautiful and big the building and grounds were kept.
I was greeted warmly by the front staff and received my room key within a few minutes.
I was also given helpful pointers to nearby attractions and restaurants.
I took the elevator up to my room ; and when I opened the door my jaw dropped as the views of the Chicago skyline was impeccable.
After relaxing I went down to the bar for a few cocktails and was impressed by the fast ; courteous service I received.
After my cocktail hour ; I decided to unwind and let me tell you the beds must be sent from heaven.
I had one of the best nights of sleep I have had in a long time.
I highly recommend the Hard Rock as I have stayed at many around the US and this is definitely on my top 5 list.
Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did ; and I ca n't wait to return.
Ashley B.
I had originally chosen the Conrad Chicago Hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance.
However ; I later learned that I had made a poor choice.
Upon arrival ; the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk.
Although ; when we reached out hotel room ; we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one-bedroom suite.
My family went back down to demand another room with two queen-size beds.
The clerk ; after a twenty minute waiting period ; was able to find us a suitable room.
Upon entering ; the room was noticably hot.
We turned on the air conditioning ; and after waiting for thirty minutes ; the room remained muggy and humid.
I called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room.
They promised a repairman within ten minutes.
1 hour later I called again and remined them that the repairman had n't shown up.
They once again promised a speedy repair.
While waiting ; I discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp.
I called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level ; but I had to go get them.
After all this trouble ; I argued that they should bring it up to me ; but in the end ; I wound up going to get it myself.
After returning to my room and waiting another 30 minutes ; the repair man had not shown up.
So I called again ; and within 5 minutes the repairman came.
He managed to fix the air conditioner ; but it was about 12am.
We were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off ; but as the night went on ; we noticed another problem.
The air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds.
It also emitted a strange odor.
Upon checking with the front desk ; we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired.
There were not available rooms left ; and being so fed up with this hotel 's poor service ; we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel.
I do n't recommend the Conrad Chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time.
' Hotel Allegro Chicago - The hotel exterior makes it out to be an old cozy hotel which it certainly is not.
Whoever decorated the rooms went way over the top trying to incorporate a modern theme.
The bathroom was really small ; not to mention very dated considering the amount of renovations to the rest of the room.
I am not coming back.
I was consistently disappointed throughout my stay at the James.
I had heard from others that it was " agreeable " and " workable " and " all right ; " or even " a nice place. " 
I figured that there would be no problems and booked a guestroom for a long weekend visit with my long-distance girlfriend.
According to the website ; I was about to immerse myself and my date in a bath of cutting-edge contemporary furnishings and " warm tones. " 
Well ; when I arrived ; I felt like I was in an Ikea showroom just before closing time on a busy day.
Everything in the front was just a bit too askew.
The staff were busy ; distracted ; inattentive ; and in every way keen to show me I was a bother to them.
I handled my own bags far too much to be convinced of their commitment to my comfort.
I also thought my room was quite pathetic for its price.
It looked distinctly like someone had rolled around on the beds just before I got there.
The bathroom fixtures felt a little bit gross and smelled very strongly ; inexplicably ; of men 's cologne.
Nobody cared when I complained of this and suggested that maybe it was just " stuck in my nose " and that it would go away.
Well ; it did n't ; and I had a horrible headache by the time my lady arrived.
This ruined my entire first evening in Chicago.
For my price I could have stayed a week at an economy hotel ; gotten my personal items treated for bedbugs ; and still saved money.
And I would not have been treated like such a pest.
Needless to say ; I will be looking elsewhere when I go back to Chicago.
I may not be a frequent patron of luxury hotels ; but I know when I am wasting my money.
Hotel Omni Chicago- The Omni Chicago Hotel was one of the worst hotels I 've stayed in ! My husband and I went there last week for three days and we had a terrible experience.
The dining room looked elegant and the food looked delicious ; but when we sat down for dinner I thought my chair was going to break ! Everything was cheap and old looking.
When I ordered a vegetarian meal ; they gave me fish that was still cold and beans that were burnt.
While the room looked elegant on the pictures ; I noticed that they had n't vacuumed under the table or the beds.
I even found a sock from a previous guest in the closet ! The bathroom was too small and smelt moldy.
The indoor pool was very crowded after dinner and was definitely not large enough for a hotel with 347 rooms.
We were going to talk a walk along Michigan Avenue ; but when we got outside we noticed the lights on the sidewalk were n't working and it was completely dark.
I will definitely never stay at the Hotel Omni Chicago again ! I was here on a weekend when there must have been a big convention or something ; because I could n't get a room at The James ; where I usually stay.
Walking in ; the lobby was gaudy and poorly lit ; and the line to check in took forever.
The elevators were tiny ; and about five more people than could actually fit squeezed their way in just before the door closed.
The chair in the room was uncomfortable and really low to the ground- I had to pull my husband up out of it.
The bathroom did n't have a bathtub ; only a shower ; and almost no room to put my toiletries to keep them organized.
The fitness center has mirrors everywhere to make it look big ; but there were only about four treadmills ; and you bet that every single one was full whenever I tried to make it down there for exercise.
It 's a bit closer to the Loop than the James ; but that did n't make up for its other problems.
I wo n't be returning.
Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago- This hotel is fairly nice and has the expected accomodation for the price.
However ; I booked this at the last moment and did n't have much chance to shop around for other deals.
For the price ; there might be better alternatives.
It was approximately $ 200 a night for a spacious studio room.
One complaint however is that I was put into a room with renovations being done in the hallways.
This created a nauseating smell everytime I left the room.
Otherwise ; the staff was very nice and supported my needs.
I had an interview the next day and the hotel was nice enough to provide shuttle service.
The breakfast too was great ! It was n't just continental but had eggs and sausage and an assortment of pastries and beverages.
They even had a computer room and printer for my printing needs.
Given a chance I would go back again ; assuming that I get assigned to a hallway not under renovation.
Very nice hotel ; better than expected.
The hot breakfast is great in the morning ; but the Dinner at night goes above and beyond ' even free wine ! The rooms are pretty good size ; well furnished ; and clean.
I liked the view from my room.
I used the fitness center and although did not have everything I would have liked ; was adequate.
I will say the pool is really nice and offers a pretty sweet view.
The staff was friendly and helpful ; being my first time in Chicago they were able to point me in the right direction and saved me some frustration.
I would definitely recommend this hotel.
I was REALLY looking forward to a nice relaxing stay at the end of a long vacation ; but unfortunately that was not to be had.
From the moment we arrived at the Omni ; the staff was belligerent and extremely rude.
They had lost our reservation and refused to give us the rate we had booked before.
If we were n't so tired ; we would 've gone to a different hotel right then ; but hindsight is 20 '20.
After we FINALLY got checked in after being made to wait needlessly for 45 minutes in the lobby ; we decided to go down to the pool ; which was tiny and kind of dirty ; so we had walked all the way down there in our suits for nothing.
The internet access was really slow.
I will NEVER stay here again.
Save yourself the headache and book somewhere else ! I was initially excited when I found out that my employer was sending me to Chicago on business ; but I could never have imagined the frustration and irritation that would be heaped on me by the inept staff of The James Chicago.
When I arrived ; my reservation could not be found in their system ; although I had made it myself.
After some words with the manager on duty ; Mr. Chad Montgomery ; I was given a room at the previously agreed upon rate.
Anyone can make a mistake ; so I was n't too angry at that point.
My room was bland and colorless ; in spite of The James boasts of their attention to design and detail.
The room was mostly clean ; but after seeing the stains on the bedding ; I am not convinced that they were washed after the room 's last occupant.
I attended a stressful business meeting in The Dining Room that night ; complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy ; disgruntled waitstaff.
Afterward I decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order.
I was assured that I would enjoy " Asha 's Purifying Shower Ritual " ; which would primarily take place in my own room.
The shower was okay ; but I think I must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided ; because I broke out in hives all over my body.
Next came the " in-room " portion.
While I was in the shower ; five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room.
I guess they were supposed to make it smell good ; but I began choking on the odor the minute I walked in the room.
My masseuse directed me to lie on the bed for the next portion ; but his hands wandered a little too much for my liking.
I am sure certain areas are NOT on the massage menu.
In closing ; if you have ever considered staying at The James Chicago ; I beg of you to reconsider.
With only a handful of positive things to say about the hotel ; and a suitcase full of negative ' including a pending court case against the masseuse ; I can almost guarantee you would regret staying there.
I know I do.
Homewood Suites Chicago I travel to Chicago a lot and have never been as impressed with a hotel as I am with Homewood Suites Chicago.
When I stepped into my room ; I was immediately hit with the Chicago skyline.
Food was easily accessible in the wonderful restaurant next to the lobby.
I took my family to the Affinia Chicago for a short vacation last summer and it was fabulous.
My kids say that their favorite part was the pool and the fact that the amusement park is really close by.
My wife was really stoked with Spaffina.
The pampering and really made her feel special.
And they are very attentive to pets also.
My dog we left home but he would have been stoked with the pets amenities and attention.The hotel is also connected to a ton of other hotels ; so their Stash award lets you earn points at a lot of other hotels also.
My favorite part of all was that my family was happy and content ; which left me free to go over to Underground Wonderbar for a nice cocktail.
When most people think Hilton ; they think luxury.
I know I did.
I only wish I 'd been half right.
Upon arriving ; I was informed that the incompetent staff had lost my reservation entirely.
Not a very auspicious start ; but they did find me another room.
Granted ; the new room had an oh-so-scenic view of the broadside of an adjacent building.
But ; fine.
I was willing to let this slide.
I did n't want to be difficult.
In the following days of my stay ; it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the Hilton very undeserving of the term ; luxury hotel.
Noisy neighbors.
Rude staff.
If the state of my bathroom towels was anything to go by upon checkout ; I doubt my sheets were changed even once.
Next time I 'll ignore the hype and stay somewhere cheaper.
The service could n't possibly be worse.
Whilst no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas.
Most notably is cleanliness ; as although the lobby was very clean ; the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not.
Dust lined the carpeted floor for the hallways ; and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time.
The furnishings were nice and modern ; but with various blemishes upon close inspection.
Bathroom was relatively clean ; with the exception of the shower.
View was nice for this particular room ; and service was relatively quick.
The food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue.
This time with the glasses which were stained ; the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel.
I will not make the mistake of staying here again.
This was really an unexpected experience for me as far as hotel accommodations go.
For this week 's vacation in Chicago ; I heard several recommendations regarding lodging ; but the James Chicago was mentioned most emphatically.
I expected an experience of comfort ; luxury and customer satisfaction ; but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of innovation and forward-thinking employed by every aspect of this hotel.
The design is breathtaking -- modern ; clean ; stylish ; sexy -- and its reflected everywhere from the lobby ; shops and restaurants ; to the stunning guest rooms themselves.
My family and I felt energized by the smartly sleek environment we were in ; and were impressed at every turn by the sophisticated take on hotel decor.
Far from a traditional hotel experience ; this was like moving into chic ; exclusive downtown apartment ; and truly an upscale adventure in modern luxury living.
Impressive ; too ; was the hotel 's overall approach to its guests and its use of the world 's resources.
From its offer of in-room recycling to the available bicycles for guest usage ; the James offers a unique perspective on its place in the world ; and gently helps its guests assist in maintaining that balance with ease and elegance.
It 's a respect that shows through ; too ; in other areas : support for artistic organizations ; charities and other programs of merit ; as well as Chicago-centric packages compiled for guests so they can make the best of their stay ; whether for a weekend ; a week ; or longer.
The James Chicago will definitely be our choice for accommodations whenever we revisit Chicago.
In fact ; we may visit again solely to stay at the James ! Hilton Chicago - I may be biased because my expectation for this Hilton hotel was high ; but $ 150 a night for an ordinary hotel room with no extra special services seems a bit pricey for me.
Aside from the price ; the noise was also a big issue for me.
I could n't get enough sleep with all the noise coming from traffic in the morning.
After staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently ; I was nothing but disappointed.
This " luxury hotel " obviously spends too much money on their marketing to convince people how luxurious they are and not enough on actually making their hotel comfortable.
When I arrived ; my hotel room was devoid of towels ; and after calling down to the front desk ; it took three hours and two more calls to finally get some fresh towels delivered.
On top of that ; when I went to connect to the internet in my room ; the wifi signal was too weak and I was forced to go out into the hall to connect with my laptop ! For the exorbitant price they charged me for one night in their " superior corner suite " ; I could have stayed a week at a Holiday Inn ; and after this stay ; I wish I had.
Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago- Horrible service.
Overpriced and lacking in service.
There are much better places to go in town.
When I first heard about this place ; I had my doubts but decided to bite the bullet and go for the pricy choice.
I was on a trip with family and wanted to splurge on the accomodations.
However ; when I came to the hotel ; my expectations were far from being met.
The pictures posted online were deceptive and hid most of the flaws in the hotel.
The bathroom had mold all over and was really disgusting ! I asked for a new room but was rudely denied.
These people only care about profit and not the service.
If you are considering to room here ; do n't ! Do yourself a favor and go to the hotel next doors.
It 's much better and is actually cheaper.
The next day ; I left the hotel and went next doors ! My wife and I stayed at the Abassador East Hotel in August to attend the Air and Water Show in Chicago.
I called ahead to ensure a SW view that would allow us to watch the airshow from our room if the weather did not permit us to watch from one of the nearby beaches.
Upon arrival at the hotel ; not only was our room on the west side of the hotel it was n't even a single king as was requested.
Apparently the hotel had overbooked king rooms for the event weekend and we were downgraded to a queen room.
The room itself was small and underwhelming.
The was not dirty ; but the linens and furnishings all had a very old and worn feel.
The hotel was packed the weekend we visited.
The staff was obviously not prepared to cater to such a large crowd.
The concierge and reception desks were continuously busy.
The hotel restaurant was very slow and had long waits.
The main lobby and other common areas throughout the hotel were also undergoing renovations making getting around and fighting crowds of other people even more difficult ! Luckly the weather was nice and the airshow was enjoyable.
We will not be staying at the Abassador on future trips.
Hopefully ; current renovations will provide a much needed lift to the hotels current worn down vibe ... 
Sofitel not-so-luxury Hotels I recently checked out from a short stay at the chicago water tower.
I originally planned to stay for a week but as my business was concluded after only 3 days I decided I had had my share of the water tower.
Simply put it offered no reasons to stay.
The Hotel is quite lovely and elegantly dressed to impress ; but little more is put forth to sway the more acquainted crowed.
The First night was a spectacle meal and there was quite a crowd ; I think for the weekend.
The next night the food was only mediocre and the third when I orderd room service I had to call twice.
Even if you do n't care about the food I think you would be wise to think twice about your stay if you have the choice.
They put on quite a show ; but that is all and when the show ended I was still hungry for more and there was no more to be found.
Upon my arrival at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago I had to wait to be helped by a bellman for 10 minutes while I waited outside in the towncar.
The bellman that ended up assisting me dropped two of my suitcases as he pushed his cart through the lobby.
The front desk service rep was busy on the phone when I approched and raised a finger to me to hold on while she finished her call.
Once I recieved my key and entered my room I realized that I had been checked into a dirty room.
I called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep. that I had previously checked in with told me that there wer n't anymore available rooms.
She told me that I needed to come back down to the lobby.
As I approched the desk I heard her yelling at a housekeeper.
She then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready.
I did n't have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so I just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned.
While I was waiting I watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge - why was I not given that suite after what I just went through ? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready.
I went back up to the same room that I had previously entered.
It was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels.
I called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items.
If my stay was n't already horrible enough after I changed and went down to the 312 retaurant connected to the hotel I ended up having to wait 30 minutes after the reservation I had made to be seated.
The meal was ok but nothing like I had expected it to be when I read about it online.
I can honestly say I will never be returning to this hotel nor this restaurant.
Set up an important meeting for some clients at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago.
They were flying to Chicago for a special trip to checkout the music scene and to discuss business with my company.
Naturally ; they wanted to stay here.
The client really seemed to like their rooms ; but felt the Paul Reed Smith room was too cramped for our day-long meeting ' 330 sq ft .. 
In a panic ; I contacted the HRH staff and they actually had another ; bigger ; room available.
We quickly moved our meeting in the Birdland room for the rest of the day and the meeting was a rousing success.
' Birdland room is 660 sq ft. '
We have a new client and so does HRH.
This is where the client wants to stay every time they fly in for future business meetings with us.
Amazing ! I was swept away when I walked into the hotel it was gorgeous.
The staff was very nice and helpful the hotel was very clean ; and the food was delicious.
We stayed two nights and the first night we went to the Lockwood restaurant and we were blown away by the food.
It has to be the best food in Chicago the atmosphere was very classy and warm and the wait staff was very precise.
The decor in our rooms did not look like any hotel I had been at they were very elegant and inviting.
I can not wait to go back it is a true escape from daily life.
As I frequent traveler due to my consulting position I have been many hotels throughout the country ; but the Sheraton ranks at my top 3 ; bar none.
Even when I arrived at the ungodly hour of 5 AM using the convenient shuttle service from Navy Pier ; I was allowed to check in to get some needed rest.
There was a beautiful view of the river ' especially with the multiple rows of windows and nearby parks ; the service was timely and luxurious ; and the meeting rooms for business were large ; spacious ; and made of svelte woods.
I especially appreciated the wide range of included bars and restaurants.
I personally enjoyed Shula 's Steak House ; with magnificent paintings ; leather chairs ; and excellent service and even a small bar nearby.
There 's a pool ; a ballroom ; and a gym for all your recreational needs ; and all are spacious and neat.The rooms themselves could be taken straight out of a palace ; the manager even had an appetizer and water for me at my arrival.
My room had a TV ; free wifi ; a coffee maker ; and a refreshment center ; making it hard to leave my room for work.
Most of all ; however ; I loved the club lounge with even more views with computers ; TVs ; late night snacks ; and sofas to keep us comfortable.
Oh ; and if you live far away from Chicago ; make sure to check out A Chicago Burger ; Millennium Park ; and the Art Institute ; all within walking distance.
This hotel is definitely a must stay.
Intercontinential Chicago Hotel - This hotel is a dump.
I had really high expectations from the reviews I read before booking a room.
Needless to say ; I was extremely disappointed.
The bathroom is really small ; the beds are n't adequate in either size or comfort and the management is rude and condescending.
The website claims that that it is in the middle of downtown Chicago but it is at least 5 blocks away from the heart of the city.
I thought I was paying a reasonable amount for a decent place ; I was sorely disappointed.
Stay away from this place ! DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL ! I would have certainly expected more from the Hilton ; especially due to the price I paid for my room and the way the hotel is portrayed.
Upon arriving at the hotel I found only one receptionist working and she was too busy texting on her mobile phone to check me in ! I had to wait 15 mins before checking in and she made me feel like I was inconveniencing her ! When I finally got into my room I was appalled.
I had a non smoking reservation and the room stank of smoke and there were several visible cigarette burns in the comforter and the carpet.
I called down to reception and to confirm that I was in a non smoking room ; which I was advised that I was.
I had to argue with the receptionist over the room for 10 mins before she agreed to switch my room for another one.
One I entered my new room ; I found that once again it stank of smoke ; but after being too exhausted from my flight I decided that I would sort it out with reception in the morning.
BAD IDEA ! I curled up and went to sleep and awoke to the go to the bathroom around 2am where I noticed my legs were COVERED in red welts ! I immediately rushed back into the bedroom and through back the covers to find my bed teaming with bed bugs.
I packed my stuff and checked out that night ; however a refund was refused.
I have since contacted the head office and I am awaiting a response.
DO NOT STAY HERE ! My wife and I were very much looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago.
We had been looking forward to a romantic getaway.
I have to say Hotel Allegro was a disappointment for both of us.
This is a pet friendly hotel - we knew that going in.
But we were shocked by the fact that we found pet hair around the room we were given.
In the carpet and even an amount on the bed cover.
Very shocking for the price we were paying.
When we called the front desk it took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to stop by.
Past this - the room itself - it has flair I guess ; but I ca n't imagine it is the right flair for many.
The colorings used a bright blue on the bed and a muted yellow ; designy wallpaper.
Neither myself or my wife found it relaxing at all.
I ca n't imagine many would.
It really was off-putting.
Overall ; the experience was a check minus in my book.
Will not be looking to return any time soon.
For the amount of money per night that the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel charges ; one would at least expect a room with a working bathroom.
The toilet would n't flush ; the sink dripped and the towels were rough and cheap looking.
When I called the front desk to ask for maintenance on the sink and toilet ; the staff were indifferent.
It was over an hour before anyone arrived to fix the bathroom fixtures ; and when they did arrive they were unable to stop the drip in the sink.
All in all ; I was disappointed with my stay.
The James Chicago hotel was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in.
The only good thing about it was that it was located downtown ; so I was n't forced to stay in it any longer than I had to.
The receptionist was rude and snobby ; my room had dirty towels in it ; and i found numerous small insects in my room.
Furthermore ; the gym and spa were closed while I was there.
Nothing was done by management to accommodate me for these inconveniences.
Next time I will take my business elsewhere.
I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers in December of last year and had one of my worst hotel experiences ever.
First ; when I went to check in ; I was completely ignored by the staff ; they were rude and seemed to have better things to do than help me check in.
When I got to my room ; all the way on the 23rd floor ; the room was dirty and had not been cleaned.
So back down to the lobby and they seemed to feel it was no big deal and gave me another room.
I went back to check and the new room was dirty also.
There were pubic hairs on the bed and in the bathroom.
It appeared the maid only went into the room and picked up trash and made the bed but did not clean.
All I can say is YUCK ! My next visit to the lobby the staff gave me an attitude about having to transfer me to another room AGAIN ! Extremely poor customer service and gross rooms.
I felt like I was staying at a $ 30 a night roach motel ; not the $ 250 a night Sheraton.
My advise is to stay away.
I am often traveling on business and I always try to stay at the James.
The modern design of the lobby and restaurant with wood and glass creates a luxurious atmosphere and the streamlined ; comfortable room design give an upscale aesthetic like that of a penthouse loft apartment.
The availability of computers and coffee in the James business centers means I do not have to lug my laptop around the hotel.
The James provides the perfect setting for business travelers and is a cozy place to retire to in the evenings.
The ease of breakfast service in the rooms means that I do not have to stress or rush ; as my time is valuable.
I love the James.
The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is one of the worse hotels I have stayed in.
Everything from the lobby to the staff to the room experience was horrible.
As I walked in to the lobby ; the lobby had a fowl smell ; similar to rotten eggs.
The staff was n't much better ; especially room service ; where it took over 30 minutes just to make my request for more towels.
The baggage handlers gave me rude service and when checking in or out ; they almost just refuse to provide service.
The room I stayed in was ill maintained and looked like nothing like in the pictures.
The windows were dirty and I could n't see anything outside the window.
The room smelled like someone soiled the room and there were ants crawling on the tabletops.
If I had to give any suggestion on this hotel ; you should just avoid this hotel all together.
Even a cheap motel has better standards than this hotel.
My husband and I satayed for two nights at the Hilton Chicago ; and enjoyed every minute of it ! The bedrooms are immaculate ; and the linnens are very soft.
We also appreciated the free wifi ; as we could stay in touch with friends while staying in Chicago.
The bathroom was quite spacious ; and I loved the smell of the shampoo they provided-not like most hotel shampoos.
Their service was amazing ; and we absolutely loved the beautiful indoor pool.
I would recommend staying here to anyone.
This was my first time in Chicago and I tell you they really made me feel like a million bucks.
I took a taxi straight from the airport and was greeted at the door by a kind gentlemen who offered to help me with my luggage and assisted me to the check-in counter.
I made my way up to my room ; which was spectacularly bright and well-lit ; then I ordered some food.
All in all the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic.
If I did n't have such a short stay in Chicago I would have stayed in my hotel room all day ! Overall ; the hotel is beautiful.
The service was great.
All the employees were friendly and always willing to help.
My room on the North end had a great view of the city and the Chicago River.
The bed and big fluffy pillows were very comfortable and relaxing.
The only downfalls were parking and the fitness room.
Parking was a little on the pricey side and not exactly as close to the hotel as one would think it should be.
The hotel itself is huge with over 1500 rooms ; so you may feel like your getting your daily exercise in just walking from your room to the fitness center depending on where your room is located.
I was visiting Chicago for a christening with my fiance.
I was impressed with this hotel from the moment I checked in.
The lobby was exceptionally modern with color and furnishings.
Front desk staff was pleasant and helpful ; especially Susan ; who quickly suggested and reserved a table for us at Keefer 's Steakhouse for a late dinner.
The room itself was fabulous.
Extremely comfortable King sized bed ; dual head shower ; breathtakingly beautiful views of the city ; I could n't ask for more.
After a great nights sleep we awoke to a great FREE breakfast right outside our room ! Next we enjoyed a couple 's massage and I was treated to a facial as my fiance took a short run through the city.
After a day full of shopping we retired to our room and ordered room service that was on time and delicious.
Unfortunately we checked out the next day ; because I could have stayed there forever.
I fully recommend the Amalfi Hotel Chicago for everyone interested in a superior stay.
It is truly a beautiful and well appointed hotel.
The James Chicago Hotel is located right in the heart of the one and only ; downtown Chicago.
This wonderful hotel has many classy and down to earth boutique 's ; and the views are breath-taking.
The hotel just has a warm feeling to it ; and the hotel staff is more than excellent.
This hotel is situated right across from the Magnificent Mile ; and only minutes away from the world famous shopping ; dining ; and fun for all ages.
The James is modern and luxurious.
The James is definately a hotel that I would recommend and will go back to in years to come.
The Hyatt Regency Hotel in Chicago was the worst hotel I ever went to ! I booked a non-smoking room online ; and they went ahead and gave me a room that smoking was allowed.
After going in my room ; I smelled heavy smoke smell.
It was really bad.
I called the front desk about the issue ; and they said they had nothing like that on record and refused to exchange rooms for me ! There was also blood stains on my bed sheets.
The carpet was also dirty.
I would never book at that Hyatt again ! James Chicago - After an exhausting flight ; the James did little to make me feel recharged.
Room service took over 30 minutes to deliver my steak ; only to discover that it was overcooked ! While they look quite elegant ; I found that their walls are essentially paper-thin as I awoke multiple times to noise emanating from other rooms.
In the morning the room continued to disappoint : the shower head was clearly mounted too low-down ; making it a pain to get decently clean.
Amalfi Hotel - I visited Chicago during the winter.
I stayed at Amalfi Hotel which was a terrible mistake.
After I entered the hotel ; the staff told me that my room had been upgraded.
So my expectations got higher but when I entered the room ; it was very dirty.
There were cigarette burn marks everywhere.
Also ; there was a used towel in the bathroom.
I complained to the staff about these issues ; they were not responsive.
My room was near the valley.
There were a lot of homeless people fighting during the night ; thus I could not sleep properly.
I will never stay in this hotel again.
From the moment I walked in I was impressed.
The staff was very courteous and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was welcoming.
The hotel was spacious and glamorous without looking overindulgent.
My room was very nice and comfortable with a beautiful view and all everything I would need was in my kitchen.
I found the pool and gym to be fantastic and I could truly relax during my stay.
I will definitely book another stay at this hotel.
Fairmont Chicago Millenium Park - I stayed at this hotel over my holiday vacation while I was visiting a close friend of mine.
The room that I stayed in was the average size ; with a king bed ; desk and a couch.
The room 's furnitures could have been arranged better ; but the room was surely large enough for me to do my work.
My husband and I had a wonderful time at Swissotel Chicago ; when my husband went for a trade fair.
We got a classic double room for two nights and it was definitely worth the money.
Clean and comfortable ; chic and new fixtures.
The view of the pier was magnificent.
Staff were most helpful and prompt when we requested extra towels and pillow.
It 's right next to riverside restaurants and river is very pretty.
The Amalfi Hotel Chicago is perfect for a romantic get-away.
My husband and I spent a weekend away from the kids there and I must say ; we were impressed by the staff and the accomodations.
We especially enjoyed the in-room spa service.
I recommend the Amalfi to anyone wanting a nice hotel in the downtown Chicago area ' you are within walking distance of shopping with great customer service and luxury accomodations ! I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently for a convention I was attending.
This was my first trip to Chicago and I had no idea what to expect and this hotel came recommended by a colleague so I had high expectations.
Check-in took a bit longer than I would have liked as they were experiencing computer problems and the staff at the front desk had to call their main reservation line to confirm reservations.
Once I did get into my room ; there was a strong cigarette odor in spite of the fact that it was a non-smoking room.
I went down to the front desk and requested a room change.
Given their computer problems ; that took almost an hour and the staff was quite surly and did n't have the " positive attitude in spite of any difficulty " I 'd expect from such a high profile establishment.
The new room was not a suite as I had originally booked but it was significantly fresher smelling.
When I hooked up my laptop ; I was dismayed to discover that there was no wi-fi service.
I had made my reservation online to take advantage of their free wi-fi for online ressies ; but as part of their computer problems ; the wi-fi service was down.
Fortunately ; there was a Starbucks up the street with available wi-fi.
Granted ; I could n't lounge at the Starbucks in my jammies like I could in my hotel room ; but connectivity for work is necessary so we make sacrifices.
I was determined not to let computer problems color my opinion of the hotel as it 's not something that is necessarily under the control of local management.
However ; the hair in the bathroom sink and the wet washcloth that was on the floor behind the toilet are definitely under the control of local management.
A quick call to housekeeping got a promise to give the room a once over while I was down the street at Starbucks.
They did as promised and when I arrived back at the room there were no stray bits of previous customer 's DNA and the dust bunny population had been eradicated.
Once I had a chance to relax in the room ; there were a few minor details that stood out.
The carpet was starting to get worn in places ; the edges on some of the furniture was dinged ; and my personal pet peeve ...  the inside of the drawers were rough ; unfinished wood which I dislike as the little splinters can cause runs in my clothes.
I would have expected higher quality furniture for such a hotel.
But ; all things considered ; my stay was tolerable.
Water pressure was good and it was quiet enough at night to get decent sleep.
The wi-fi was still down in the morning so I checked out early and spent my time enjoying a latte and free wi-fi at Starbucks.
I would not reccomend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago if you want a good deal and a good nights sleep.
I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago for two nights this past July.
I had a select king city view room.
The room was dark ; with ugly black carpets and the view was of another building right next door - not a great view.
I was on an upper level floor and the elevators were incredibly slow.
The hotel was pretty loud and the people in the room next to mine were up partying all night long ; so it was very hard to get to sleep on my first night there.
When I called to complain at the front desk they promised to do something about it but never did.
I ended up having to call two more times before the management did something about the room next door.
They quieted down for about an hour ; but then were loud again for the rest of the night.
The hotel was expensive ; and for the price there were n't very many special amenities.
There was no continental breakfast and the wifi was not included -- you had to sign up for a day of service at $ 10 a day.
Overall I would not recommend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago ; as it is way overpriced for what you get.
Conrad Chicago review Rather a bad experience to stay in this terrible hotel.
I stayed at Deluxe suite in Conrad Chicago for one night.
The shower water did n't stay hot so that I did n't finish washing my hair and went to an important business meeting directly.
A mirror was in front of my bed.
It was horrible to wake up at night seeing a big mirror in front of me.

The building looks a bit old from the outside ; but the lobby is very inviting ; and everything looks very exquisite.
The room is clean and luxurious ; and they literally have the best bed and feather pillow out of all the hotels I 've ever stayed in.
Its attached restaurant Pump Room is a bit pricey though ; but there are a lot of good restaurants and cafes within walking distance ; especially convenient for people like me who does n't like going too far away. The Ambassador East Hotel - I stayed at at a regular room with king-sized bed while on business.
The bathroom next to the entrance was decently-sized and well-stocked with necessities.
Overall a pleasant experience.
There 's apparently a rather famous restaurant known as the Pump Room in this hotel that I 'd like to try if I come here again.
Omni Chicago Hotel - We stayed here when visiting Chicago for a week.
We took the Breakfast - parking package for $ 270 a night.
They charge $ 54 for parking otherwise if you do n't ; which is quite expensive.
The rooms however were great.
The deluxe suite we had booked was quite roomy and even had its own sitting area.
The beds were comfortable ; and the room was well kept.
Casey ; at the front desk was especially helpful and friendly ; and the kids loved her.
The indoor pool and gym facilities were a good add on for someone like me who likes working out.
The shopping area is within walkable distance from the hotel.
Also do try Cafe 676 when your there ; it 's quite a classy place and the food is amazing.
The overall experience was quite good ; and I 'd recommend trying it.
Amalfi Hotel Chicago - Amalfi Hotel Chicago ; We traveled to Chicago last spring and stayed at Amalfi Hotel for three days.
We will never come back to this hotel.
We selected this hotel because we found many positive online feedbacks about it.
But we had a very bad experience.
It is one of the worst hotels I have ever been to.
The bathroom of our room was too old and the sink was leaking causing the bathroom floor to be wet all the time ! We reported the problem to room service and they were very apologetic but they refused to change the room because there is no vacant room available.
Also ; the water pressure of the shower was too weak making it long to get a quick bath.
The food was not so tasty and we had to wait 45 minutes to get our order.
It seems that the staff are not organized and the management is ignorant.
Never waste your money at Amalfi Hotel.
My husband and I recently stayed stayed at the Hilton Chicago and it was a horrible experience.
When we arrived ; the front desk clerk was on the phone on what sounded like a personal call and did n't even acknowledge us for at least five minutes.
When we got to our room I went to lay on the bed and noticed a black hair on the pillow.
I 'm am very paranoid about hotels being dirty ; so I pulled back the sheets and moved all the pillows around and noticed several more hairs.
I called for some new sheets which they said they would send right up but it actually took nearly 30 minutes.
The second night we were there we decided to try the Irish pub in the hotel called Kitty O 'Sheas because my husband loves pub food.
We had the shepherd 's pie which was awful.
It was watery and had no flavor and it was not cheap ! Our server seemed annoyed when we complained and did not offer it to be taken off the check.
While we had a great trip to Chicago ; the Hilton was definitely NOT a highlight of our trip.
Overall ; we had rude service ; a dirty room and bad food.
Spend your money elsewhere I walked into this beautiful hotel and knew that I would have a wonderful stay in Chicago.
After walking around the city all day ; I was always excited to relax in this cleanly and superbly comforting place.
The service was friendly and I especially liked the location.
What a Treat ! Sofitel Chicago Water Tower ; " I went to Chicago last month for a conference and enjoyed my staying at Sofitel.
At first I booked there simply because the location was really close to where the meeting was held ; but later on I was impressed by more than great location.
The room was so spacious that I was able to do some abs workout the night before the conference to refresh myself a little bit.
The room was also very quiet ; which made me sleep really well.
Breakfast was excellent ; especially their omelets.
The service was also pretty good.
There was a very helpful concierge girl who directed me and my friends to a really nice bar ' forgot the name the night before we left.
Although the conference was not that exciting ; discovering Sofitel Water Tower made me feel good about the trip because I would 't have a hard time making decisions next time I visit Chicago.
Totally worth the money. " 
I did stay in this hotel couple of days back and was a bit disappointed with it.
The hotel did not quiet live up to the expectation I was indeed expecting.
The rooms were dull and cramped with very small bed.
The parking lot was small for a hotel of this size.
Further the staff was not very welcoming.
I faced problems with the room as it was a bit noisy and also due to the fact that the elevators were close to my room.
The dining hall was packed and had to wait in the lounge for quiet sometime.
The refrigerator made loud and clunky noise which was fixed later.
Different beer and wine were served rather than the one that I asked for.
However the location was good and housekeeping did a good job.
Overall I would prefer staying at another hotel for the same expense.
The Hard Rock should stick to restaurants.
After a recent stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago I think they should go back to what there good at.
Besides having to wait an hour for my room to be ready ' this is after my check in time ; the receptionist was very rude and seemed to not care that I was being delayed.
After seeing the state the room was in I still do not understand what took so long.
The sheets look to have been picked up off the floor and returned to the bed.
The bathroom looked as if somebody had just used it ' I will leave out the details.
Complaining did n't seem to get me anywhere ; they offered me a small discount at the hotel 's bar.
After this experience I will be more likely to book at a Motel 6 then return to the Hard Rock.
Sofitel Chicago Water Tower ; " I went to Chicago last month for a conference and booked Sofitel Water Tower because it was close to the conference location.
After my trip ; I kind of regretted of this decision I made.
There was nothing too special about this hotel except location ; and the location was really not worth $ 300 per night.
Some of my friends were staying in hotels a little bit far away but much cheaper ; and it was really convenient to take the cabs.
I pretty much stayed in the conference for the whole day ; and all I did in the hotel was sleeping.
But I was not even able to enjoy the only thing I did there.
My room was cold and VERY humid ; and the bathroom smelled disgusting.
The bed was not comfortable too ; which woke me up twice in one night.
Absolutely not worth the money I spent. " 
Upon arriving to the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago ; I was immediately impressed.
The staff was friendly and checked us in quickly ; which is important to me after a long trip.
Our room was immaculate and decorated in a clean modern style.
The bed was very comfortable ; including the linens which felt high quality ; unlike what you get at some other hotels.
All this made for a great night sleep.
Perhaps the most impressive part of our stay at the Hard Rock Hotel was their " Party like a Rottweiler " package we added to our reservation.
For an additional fee we were able to bring our pet and were provided with treats ; toys and best of all the pet cam ! We left our dog in the room with a pet cam and were able to watch him throughout the day on my iPhone ! All in all this was a great place to stay and I 'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to travel with their pet.
The stay at the Hilton Chicago definetely felt like a vacation.
Sleeping in that big wonderful bed felt like I was at home ! The accommodations and hotel are beautiful.
I especially enjoyed the gym.
The staff was friendly and helpful.
I would reccommend this Hotel to anyone who is looking for a home away from home.
The Affinia hotel in Chicago was superb.
the room service was exemplary and the food ; I do n't even know were to start.
The chef obviously knew what he was doing ; I especially loved the seafood ; my personal favorite was the shrimp.
Aside from this ; I loved how beautiful the hotel was.
It is definetly a bargain for the price ; for that price you would probably get a good 3 star hotel but ; I felt as if i was in a $ 10 ; 000 a night 5 star hotel in the Europe.
great bang for your buck.
Would recommend it to anybody looking to relax at a great hotel with great amenities in a great city.
My friends actually went their a while back because of me.
They loved it ! I know you will too.
Hyatt Regency Chicago seemed like a nice place to stay ; but we did n't like it very much.
The renovations were cheap and poorly done ' our bathroom faucet was leaky and the carpet had bumps in it. '
The staff was RUDE ! I was trying to find a good cab service ; and the guy behind the front desk made me wait for 20 minutes while he was finishing a phone call ! Could n't he have at least called someone else to help me ? The " Babies Travel Lite " gave us the wrong sized diapers ; so we had to go find some anyway ; and with the hotel being located in the heart of the city that meant we found some unsavory characters along the way.
Sofitel Chicago Water Tower I stayed at Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for a weekend last September.
Now ; I had a several bad experiences with this hotel.
I arrived just one hour earlier than the check-in time ; but I was not allowed to check in ; so I had to leave my luggage at the reception area and walk around on the street to pass the time.
Luckily ; the weather was good so I enjoyed my walk.
My room was cleaned nicely ; but I was on the third floor so I did n't have any view of the city.
There was free internet access ; but the speed was extremely slow and made it almost impossible for me to work and communicate online.
I tried several times and finally gave up.
The bathroom was certainly large ; but I did not enjoy the shower due to the low water pressure coming out of the shower head.
The part that I was most frustrated by was the cleaning lady who came early in the morning around 8am ' despite my DO NOT DISTURB sign ; and I was woken up by her knocking on the door.
I would not recommend this hotel to others.
Hotel Omni Chicago- My husband and I stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a long weekend last April.
It was the best weekend I 've had in a long time ! From the fancy dining room ; the excellent guest service ; to the relaxing pool we had everything we could have wished for to make our stay a memorable stay.
When we got to our suite the room had everything we needed : Lavender soap ; shampoo ; conditioner ; a hair drier ; even an ironing board ; Wi-Fi and a flat screen TV.
There was nothing missing ! Our dinner was also amazing.
Not only did they have a vegetarian meal ; but they also replaced the potatoes with carrots and peas 'of course free of charge ! The fitness room was also amazing ; they had several treadmills and a warm pool.
When we went to the pool after dinner we were the only people there so we were able to enjoy the peace and quiet.
Before we went back to our rooms we enjoyed a long walk along Michigan Avenue ; passing by the shops ; park and the art museum.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a wonderful stay in Chicago ! A recent stay at the James Hotel-Chicago ; revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only.
Although the rooms and public areas look nice ; the hotel still needs serious work.
Our first room was not clean when we arrived and this non-smoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke.
We asked for a new room which was clean and odor free.
We had to involve the Manager before our request was granted.
The new room was better at first glance ; but was severely lacking.
We could not get the temperature properly regulated.
The room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay.
In a hotel commanding the rates of the James ; we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted ; not something which is a constant battle.
Our mattress was horribly uncomfortable.
When the rooms were updated ; the James skipped new mattresses.
Ours was worn to the point of having indentations you ca n't get out of -- when you lie down ; you sort of sink into a hole.
This matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a ' luxury hotel.
Last ; but not least ; we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay.
In spite of the calming decor ; the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good night 's sleep.
All in all ; we were unhappy with our accommodations at the James Chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location.
You will be happier almost anywhere else.
O.M.G best hotel ever ! i 've stayed at various hotels in the area and the service has been really suckish.
evan at one hotel i stayed at they had a molded sandwhich under the bed ; how gross and i could of really got sick ! but this hotel was the perfect location right by the beach and by all the clubs . ohh . and the pump room ; the best food i 've evr had at a hotel .
i evan got to take a picture with Queen Anne ! i will never regret coming to this hotel ! i loved this hotel so much me and my bridemaid 's stayed here . and it 's just walking distance from all the popular food places and clubs .  all the places to be at least When you 're paying over $ 350 'night for a hotel ; you 'd expect a world-class experience and amenities.
Unfortunately ; I got no such thing during my stay.
True ; they have tons of space and features like a ballroom ; gym ; and bars ; as well as a great location within walking distance of the Navy Pier.
But the pros end there.
I was honestly disappointed with our standard-sized room ; which definitely made you feel like a second-class citizen compared to the club level guests.
There was a shower but no bathtub ; the room was on the small side ; and I did n't even get a lake-facing room.
When I opened the pre-stock fridge I was disgusted to see nothing but expired fruit inside.
I mean ; do they even inspect the rooms at all ? Worst of all ; however ; was an air vent near the bed that constantly let in unwanted noise at night.
I tried to contact the hotel manager about it ; but all he offered were points in their loyalty program.
How useless ! Outside the room there were problems as well.
Yes ; there 's a pool ; but the water was absolutely freezing ; and to make matters worse ; I was unable to find a towel for over an hour ; and so here I was freezing my butt off waiting to dry off.
The gym was ok ; but was very small and dirty looking with way too many treadmills and not enough weights.
I 'd much rather go for a run outside by the beautiful lake ; admittingly one of the finer points of Chicago.
Do not go to this hotel simply because of the pretty interior you see in brochures and their website.
You will regret it.
On a recent work trip to Chicago I stayed at The James hotel and I ca n't say I would recommend it for anyone trying to get work done while staying there.
My main problem was that I could not get a reliable internet connection to their wifi in my room ' and there was no wired connection to fall back to and even when I managed to connect to the network the connection was very slow.
I ended up having to use the wifi in the lobby of the hotel.
The restaurant was that great either but the hotel is well located so it easy to find something better in the neighborhood.
Other than that ; the room was good and had a nice view.
The staff were polite and tried to help me with my internet connection issues.
I do n't know how this hotel ever got such high ratings from others.
This hotel was for me : over priced ; fingerprints on the walls ; stains in the bathroom ; funky loud people in the hallway early in the morning ; parking 'valet was time consuming ; and same thing with the elevator.
The back to the 1960 's furniture is not for me ; and what about the breakfast ? Better to skip their protein-less stuff they had to offer.
Oh sure it is a Hilton ; woopee ! You pay for the privilege of sleeping there.
Saw a couple of bed bugs ; but took a shower in the morning ; and they seemed to wash away.
I wo n't be back to Hilton Homewood Suites again.
I 'd rather stay somewhere outside the city to save money.
Think that I 'll be happier as well.
This fantastic hotel has it all : luxury ; an excellent location and a fun atmosphere.
The rooms are spacious and well decorated ; and the staff is always helpful and courteous.
Whether you 're traveling for business or fun ; I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago.
I stayed there with my wife recently ; we were on a short weekend break and we wanted to enjoy the music an just have fun.
The Hard Rock certainly delivered what we were looking for.
The hotel is in a central location ; within easy reach of the main tourist spots in the city ; however ; there 's superb food on site and the best entertainment you could wish for ; so there 's barely a need to leave to hotel ! ' well ; we DID leave the hotel to see the sights ; but you know what I mean.
My wife and I particularly enjoyed the gym and spa facilities ; including a relaxing massage.
This hotel surpassed our expectations in every possible way ; and we 'll surely be staying there again the next time we visit the Windy City.
Fantastic Hotel ! Upscale and luxurious ; and in a great location ! Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff goes out of their way to treat guests like royalty ! The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean ; the beds are comfortable and even the bathrooms were to die for ! My husband and I had a great time in the lounge and enjoyed many of the amenities.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone ; and ca n't wait to get back there myself ! We stayed at this hotel for our last vacation to the windy city.
Although the hotel looks nice ; the service is terrible.
The staff was rude and unprofessional and not helpful at all.
The room service closes at 8pm so do n't plan on getting hungry after that time.
Also ; even though we stayed for a whole week we had to ask for new towels and extra toiletries.
I will never go back to that place We had the pleasure of enjoying a stay at the Affinia Chicago Hotel.
We found it conveniently located on E. Superior Street ; near many local attractions.
The rooms were modern chic with a very urban feel.
The pillow menu was awesome ; my partner and I have such different preferences ; the choices made it easier to sleep like we were at home.
The hotel room layout was comfortable and spacious with all the right touches to make our stay perfect ! I could n't believe the amenities available to guests.
My Beagle ; Betsy enjoyed her stay at the " Jet Set Pet " care center.
She was pampered as much as I was.
It was such a comfort knowing we could bring her along and that we could enjoy our stay without the stress and concern that comes along with traveling and pet ownership ! Another feature I personally enjoyed was the Walking Tour Kit.
It included an iPod Shuffle pre-loaded with a workout playlist ; a deck of cards ; guidebook that included walking tours ; and comfort items like a towel and map ! I felt like I was the most important guest ' surely ; everyone felt that way as they checked in to their rooms.
Highly recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to travel in the area of an Affinia Hotel ! Best hotel in an excellent location I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower with my husband and kid as he came there for a Business purpose.
My 1 year old kid was jumping on the bed and he really enjoyed the atmosphere of the room.
The front desk people were too welcoming and the staffs were very friendly .
The room service was also good.
The room was very clean and the bathrooms are so good .
I like the decor of the room.
The French restaurant in Sofitel is so good and we both enjoyed the dining .
I will surely prefer to stay in Sofitel on a next time travel to Chicago.
swissotel - We ended up booking swissotel at the last minute for Christmas ; and I was a little concerned that there were still rooms open.
Fortunately ; the experience turned out to be great.
It was right next to the pier ; which made for an excellent view.
The room was spacious and beautifully decorated.
We spent one night in and went to the hotel 's restaurant.
The salmon was incredible.
The only issue I had with this hotel was that we could n't stay longer.
James Chicago - After an exhausting flight ; it was a pleasure to decompress at the James.
Room service was prompt and surprisingly good ; I recommend the 12 oz. NY strip steak.
I was pleasantly surprised that I slept through the night without being disturbed as I am a very light sleeper ; they must have lined the walls with noise-suppressing padding.
I found only one annoyance : the shower head was a bit low-down 'c but what else can you expect when you 'fre six-foot-six.
Talbott Hotel - My family and I had a disappointing stay at the Talbott.
The excellent location and reasonable rates are what drew us to this hotel ; but that was it.
Apart from the location and rates ; everything was terrible.
The rooms were very old and not at all modern and were very dimly lit.
Upon checking the bathroom ; I saw that the shower head was rusted.
Also ; we were hardly able to sleep at night due to the loud construction noises coming from the street.
Furthermore ; there is no gym facility available on site.
But the most disappointing part of our stay was that we never got housekeeping services until we specifically asked for it.
I would not recommend the Talbott at all.
Save yourself the frustration and stay somewhere else.
Amalfi Hotel - We had the pleasure of staying at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago.
Its location makes it a gem as it is close to down town.
We liked their novel idea of serving breakfast on every floor.
It makes breakfast quite accessible.
The bathroom was clean and the staff was very cooperative.
The staff even remembered our names that made us feel special.
Amalfi also provides free internet which is fast and it helped me a lot as I had to prepare for a meeting the next day.
We got wonderful view of Chicago river from our room and also the room was spacious and had a comfortable bed.
We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently and had a great experience ! My husband and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting downtown Chicago.
We are frequent travelers who are used to staying in well-maintained ; luxury properties with many amenities and the Omni Chicago definitely fit the bill.
First of all ; the hotel is all suites.
We stayed in one of the " Premium Suites " .
The accommodations were definitely luxurious ; with premium bedding ; very nice robes for our use ; and a choice of pillows.
We used the hypo-allergenic ones ; but I believe you could have also chosen foam or feathers.
We were pleased to find that the TV was plasma ; we have found that not all hotels have upgraded to plasma and we do n't wish to use one of the old-fashioned type of TVs anymore now that we are so used to plasma at home.
There were actually two TVs in our suite.
There were also some additional amenities that we appreciated such as high-speed internet access ; a wet bar ; an indoor swimming pool and two gorgeous sundecks for relaxing outside.
The location was perfect as it was right in the midst of the Miracle Mile ; with so much to do practically at the Omni 's doorstep.
I also treated myself to the Windy City Massage ; which was done in the comfort and luxury of our suite.
The masseuse was excellent and she used very high-quality products for my sensitive skin.
It was extremely relaxing and I was so pleased to find out that I could get this at the Omni.
It was easy for us to see why the Omni came so highly recommended.
I also wanted to mention that the staff was very helpful and friendly ; recommending several excellent area restaurants.
However ; we think our best meal was at the Omni 's 676 Restaurant ; where my husband raved about the bone-in ribeye and I had the carrot soup and the Lake Erie Silver Bass.
They had an extensive wine list and we were easily able to choose wines we loved with the staff 's guidance.
Lastly ; the hotel staff also highly recommended we visit the nearby Art Institute of Chicago ; which was a highlight of our trip.
We loved that there were multiple museums so close to the Omni ! We will be frequent visitors at the Omni in the future ; where I will definitely be getting the in-room massage again.
We are going to pass this recommendation on to all of our friends and family - choose the Omni for a great Chicago experience ! This is the best hotel to stay in when visiting Chicago.
I travel a lot ; both for business and vacation.
The Talbott Hotel is a cozy yet stately hotel that is handsome ; and elegant.
Not to mention all the modern features that I 'm used to having at home ; are available in the room.
I brought my wife on my last business trip and we stayed in the one bedroom suite.
She did n't even want to leave the room.
The concierge was especially helpful in finding us a romantic place to go for dinner.
The Hilton in Chicago was awesome.
The room was very clean and the hotel staff was very professional.
One of the features I liked ; was that in my room the internet access was wire and wireless ; considering my laptop is not wireless ; it help me out alot.
Food was very good ; quality was great.
There was also a flat screen in my room ... awesome.
The hotel itself is locaated in the middle of alot of resturants with fin dinning.
I also enjoyed the gym very much.
Overall ; I enjoyed myself ; and I will stay again at the Hilton when I return to Chicago.
I stayed here last August and I 'm truly glad that I will never have to stay here again.
The website does a great job of creating an illusion.
The rooms are so much smaller than it seems on the website.
I thought the Monaco was walking distance to a few nightclubs but it isnt.
The wireless internet is free but it is extremely slow.
For such a " classy " hotel ; there isnt a pool.
At $ 46 per night ; the on-site parking is way too expensive for guests.
All and all ; I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago advertises itself as family friendly ; yet when I arrived with my children it was anything BUT family friendly.
The staff seemed miffed and stuck up ; and I had to wait for the personal check in.
I was too worried that my kids would ruin the obviously really expensive furniture while I waited ; and other guests ' all single or couples without children seemed annoyed every time I passed with my kids while I was trying to keep them entertained before we checked in.
This might not be the best place to stay if you have a kid or two ; even though it is advertised as such.
I give you a great big Thumbs Down for false advertising ; Amalfi.
This has been one of the most pleasurable hotels Ive ever stayed at.
From the beautiful concourse to the amazing food ; Amalfi really exceeds its standards.
The in-room spa service was so relaxing and the tang of the wine was incredible.
I highly recommend this hotel as I will give my stay a 5 '5 stars.
Homewood suites Chicago : It is situated in a very good location being at the heart of the city.
The staff of the hotel are quiet friendly and the rooms are good to.
The rooms were spacious and even the spacious balcony provided a place to just relax and wind up in the evening with a good view of the city.
I was also happy with the parking space available.
The rooms were clean and well equipped however the decor needs updating.
The Wi-Fi was intermittent which was a bit disappointing but the problem was fixed later.
The laundry was done the same day which added a nice touch to the overall feeling.
Overall it was a pleasant experience.
This hotel was very poor with customer service.
They were so worried about keeping everything up to date and perfect looking in the hotel they rarely worried about their customers ; and their guests.
I had to ask for my room to be serviced for cleaning ; and it took a long time to get a response.
Very disappointed.
A few weeks ago we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago.
The hotel was a bust from the get go.
As we arrived in the lobby ; we had to wait several minutes for the front desk clerk to show up.
' We could hear her talking in the back for 5 minutes. '
When she got to the desk she was very short with us and not very helpful.
We had to wander around the halls looking for our room.
Once we got to our room ; we thought the weekend was going to get better.
The rooms are modern and nicely designed.
That was about all that this hotel had going for it though.
As soon as we started to explore the room more ; it was clear this room had been a haven for a party a few nights before.
The bathroom smelled of vomit and the bath tub had small shards or glass from broken bottles in it.
We called a worker and they cleaned most of it up ; but the thought of it still remained.
As we all settled down to sleep ; there were a few loud noises coming from the room next door.
After about an hour ; we finally made a call to the front desk to complain.
The woman said that a rock band was in that room and they had just finished a show in Chicago.
They were staying there the next 2 nights.
I would n't recommend this hotel to anyone ! It 's a hard rock hotel all right.
' At least that 's what the beds feel like ! Affinia hotel in Chicago was one of the most interesting hotels I have ever stayed in.
Everything looks very nice and fancy ; though the people that work there must be from the projects of Chicago.
The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life ! When we went to check in ; first we had to wait about 15 minutes for the 3 workers that were at the desk to stop their personal conversation and check us in.
When the women at the counter finally acknowledged us ; she was smacking her gum ; and was upset and treating us like we were inconveniencing her ! The room service brought us cold eggs for breakfast ; and the attitude of the staff overall was extremely rude.
I would NEVER go back ; and I hope this place gets a staff makeover if they want to stay in business.
' Hotel Allegoro Chicago - The bedroom decor was a bit over the top for me but the beds were very comfortable and we had an excellent view.
The bathroom was very clean which was a plus and it was nice to be able to bring along our dog.
I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially those traveling with pets.
Hotel Monaco is simply amazing.
I travel quite a bit ; and am use to generic hotels ; with horribly unimpressive rooms ; and " 5 star amenities " which usually mean a packet of instant coffee ; and room service that wo n't serve after 9pm.
Hotel Monaco on the other hand was very impressive.
The suite i stayed in was stylish and cozy.
This hotel has such personality.
My absolute favorite part of my stay ; aside from the amazing meal i had down stairs ; was the in-room spa treatment.
Hotel Monaco just raised the bar on hotels for me.
Generic just wo n't do anymore.
If you 're looking for luxuary ; look no more.
The Conrad is the best.
I was in Chicago on business ; and had to stay much longer than anticipated.
A coworker suggested this hotel and boy am I glad he did.
The location is perfect ; you 're close to everything.
The best part is the Conrad is a smoke free hotel.
I 'll be back soon.
Very Satisfied What I hoped would be a pleasant stay turned into a nightmare.
The first sign of trouble at the Affinia was that they could n't find my reservation.
Add to that the room service delivered cold food after a long wait and the mini bar was not well stocked.
The internet service was so slow it was unusable.
To top it off the street noise seemed to penetrate the thin walls with ease making getting a good night sleep nearly impossible.
Finally ; I discovered the valet parking ; which was a $ 49 premium service ; dented my fender and scratched the door paint on my car.
I highly recommend going elsewhere when you visit Chicago.
My husband and I stayed at the Omni after attending a wedding that took place there.
We were delighted at the luxury of the rooms and the accomodations were wonderful.
Everyone from the concierge to the housekeepers were friendly and professional.
We were extremely pleased with the whole experience and look forward to our next trip to Chicago so we can stay there again.
And ; by the way ; the wedding was absolutely gorgeous ! Hard Rock Hotel - We stayed here in March ; and this place really blew me away.
It 's only a few blocks away from a train station and a subway stop ; so we did n't have to walk far in the 20 degree weather '85 Yikes.
I was on an upper floor ; so noise was n't a problem and the view at night was spectacular ; but my friend said hers was a little noisier.
I guess just ask when you make the reservation.
The bathroom was a little cramped ; but the room itself was sizable.
We were going to go to the lobby bar for drinks before heading out for the night ; but they did n't have very many tables for bigger groups.
We ended up going to Chuck 's Manufacturing instead ; which had some really fun cocktails and was surprisingly big for a hotel restaurant.
The concierge gave us directions to this amazing Lebanese place for dinner that was only a few blocks away ... 
Ca n't remember the name now ; but just ask her ; it was awesome ! Do n't let the website fool you.
I stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago on my last business trip ; and this was probably one of the worst 4 star hotel I 've ever stayed at.
The website makes the place look like a 4 star hotel but it 's more on par with a 2 stars or 3 ; if you want to be generous.
First off ; the rooms are not as nice or clean as they look in the picture.
The room that I checked into was dingy with paint peeling from the walls ; and the carpet looked like it had n't been vacuumed since god knows when.
Since I was only staying one night ; I decided not to ask for a different room- although I do n't know if asking for a different room would 've made any difference considering the lack of hospitality from the reception desk.
When I arrived ; there were two receptionists chatting it up- no acknowledgement ; no prompt service.
I had to wait about 3 minutes although I was the only one in line before any of them acknowledged me.
And no ; they were n't talking about hotel matters.
I 'm not a difficult or an especially picky person ; and who does n't chat during work with their co-workers but for them to completely ignore and make a client wait for 3 minutes shows serious lack of professionalism.
Do yourself a favor ; and go stay at the Marriott if you want service- unless the price is tempting but you get what you pay for.
This hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere.
It smells because pets are allowed.
This hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed.
There was mold in our room and bathroom ; pet hair everywhere ! Kids love pools.
How can they claim to be kid friendly without one ? My kid was bored.
The food was basically the same every day ; no variation in the menu.
Pictures on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their " travel club " because our room did n't even remotely resemble the pictures.
They did the old bait and switch.
We reserved a " family room " .
When we opened the door of our room ; we realized that it was n't what the website pictured or had what the website described.
We kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers.
Definitely do not recommend this hotel ! I was not at all impressed with my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago.
Checking in there were two people ahead of me but apparently that takes the 1 ' one ! front desk agent 30 minutes to process.
Both guests had issues with their rooms regarding ; it seemed ; wrong room types and being out of the room type requested.
I was nervous about my own reservation and ; sure enough ; my Superior Corner room was n't available.
The hotel tried to compensate me with complimentary breakfast and drinks at the bar but it is still annoying to reserve a room type and not have it be available.
I was also annoyed that every little thing has an upcharge at the hotel.
Want internet ? Upcharge.
Want extra pillows ? Upcharge.
Extra coffee for the room ? Upcharge.
Bad enough to get that treatment on the airline ride over but to have a hotel nickle and dime you is very annoying and aggravating.
I wo n't be back and would strongly recommend other travelers to beware before booking.
I 've stayed at other hotels in Chicago ; but this was the first absolutely horrifying experience.
First off the staff was incredibly rude.
I could have lived with that being that it was busy ; but when the person would not get off their cell phone while a was checking in it had me wanting to pull my hair out.
The room was also horrid.
It smelled like sex and cigar smoke so bad in there that I was convinced a politician had just checked out after using it for a cheap affair.
There was also what looked to be dried snot on the shower curtain.
Mark my words : Never again will I stay at this dump ! Fairmont Chicago Millenium Park - This hotel might be the last hotel I might turn to in Chicago.
I could say that the room was not bad ; but I could n't help bouncing around like a ping pong ball inside the room.
Of course this would have been fun for kids like 3 generations under me ; but obviously I 'm not one of them.
Having a bed that just takes up space in the middle of the room made the whole experience stuffed.
I stayed at the Affina Chicago for my anniversary.
The hotel is in a great location ; but that does n't make up for the poor customer service and rudeness of the staff.
It looked like the cleaning crew forgot to vacuum from the last guest since there was hair on the carpet.
I spent more money than I would normally ; hoping for a luxury experience ; and left very unsatisfied.
The Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel is perfecty located in the center of downtown Chicago.
Whether you are going there for business or pleasure ; it is in the perfect place.
The rooms are large and beautiful and the ball room took my breath away.
The wi-fi connection was perfect for the work I needed to do and the show at the Navy Pier was perfect for when I needed a break.
Other hotels have nothing on the Hyatt.
I just wish there was a Hyatt Regency in every city for all of my business trips.
I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers a couple nights ago.
The service was excellent ! As soon as i stepped through the door they grabbed my bags ; and were helping me choose the best hotel room for me ! I loved there service and the room was gorgeous ! I highly recommend it for anyone ; and there prices are n't as bad as others.
I loved the experience and I 'm sure next time I 'm in the area I 'll visit again ! This is a great place to stay while visiting Chicago.
My husband and I went over the holidays to see my family and we stayed at this hotel.
We could not have asked for nicer people ! Everyone was always smiling and very helpfull ! We usually stay at the Ramada ... but will never stay anywhere other than the InterContinental Chicago hotel again ! - Casey L. Skinner I stayed at Swissotel Chicago for 1 night while on vacation with my girlfriend.
Our plan was to stay 3 nights there originally but its beauty could not make up for the poor service we received from the front desk associate.
We walked in and despite being the only guests waiting to check in ; we still stood waiting for 10 minutes while the person at the desk chatted on the phone with someone who was clearly not related to the hotel.
Once me leaning against the counter finally got her attention ; she got off the phone and acted like I was the one at fault.
Needless to say I will not be staying here again.
What I thought was going to be a romantic Chicago Weekend turn out to be lackluster.
The Swissotel Chicago per their website seem to tout itself as a luxury destination well much to my surprise it was not.
First my reservation was messed up instead of getting " the classic room with a view " we were put in what I guess is their classic king.
The view was nothing to write home about.
When I called the front desk to complain about the situation I was told their was nothing they could do since the hotel was booked solid.
I asked how could this happen when I got a confirmation ? The clerk simply said " probably a glitch sorry is there anything else I can help you with ? " At the point I hung up the phone as I knew our romantic weekend with a view was not going to happen.
When we checked out I told a manager what happened and He said there was nothing we can do sorry " I expected a little more customer service from them since they think of themselves as a luxury destination.
Omni Chicage Hotel - A friend and I stayed at the hotel over a weekend.
The experience was really disappointing.
We paid $ 250 a night while staying here ; only to realize we were being charged $ 300 when checking out ; as they did not mention the additional parking charges right at the start.
The staff was not helpful in the least ; saying that it was mentioned earlier.
The room was quite spacious ; though was n't well kept.
The bed linens for one were not very clean.
To add to that ; the bathroom lights were not working ; and required to be changed while we were staying there.
Also it 's located near Northwestern Memorial hospital ; and the ambulance sirens you hear at night are a nuisance.
I thought the stay at the hotel was not worth it ; as we had a really bad experience.
We stayed at the Schicago Hilton for 4 days and 3 nights for a conference.
I have to say ; normally I am very easy going about amenities ; cleanliness ; and the like ... however our experience at the Hilton was so awful I am taking the time to actually write this review.
Truly ; DO NOT stay at this hotel.
When we arrived in our room ; it was clear that the carpet had n't been vacuumed.
I figuered ; " okay ; it 's just the carpet. " 
Until I saw the bathroom ! Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned ' i.e. ; a paper band across the toilet ; paper caps on the drinking glasses ; etc. ; it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place.
There was a spot ' probably urine ! on the toilet seat and ; I kid you not ; the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass.
I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things " appear " clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary.
Well ; the Hilton was proof.
I called downstairs and complained ; and they sent up a chambermaid hours later.
Frankly ; I found the room disgusting.
The hotel itself ; outside the rooms ; was cavernous and unwelcoming ; with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din.
Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this.
When I got home ; I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not ; such was the skeeviness of our accomodations.
Please ; do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel.
The Ambassador East Hotel is a pretty girl with a bad heart.
As i was staying for a few nights I notied may problems with the service of this expensive ; cold hotel.First the room sevice was poorly helpful ; the bag boy insisted on a tip ; and also droped my bag.
The chefs cooking was terriable ; the steak that I spent 35 dollars on was suppost to be rare ; but came to me burnt.
The room was not what you pay for ; the beds were like a sack of rocks.
And to top it off the covers smelled like smoke.
I will never give the Ambassador East Hotel another chance.
My husband and I recently traveled to Chicago on a mini vacation.
We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in the downtown area.
This hotel is simply beautiful.
From the time we walked through the front doors until the day we left ; we were treated as if we were royalty.
I have never been treated so well.
We were greeted by staff that sincerely seemed to love their jobs.
We stayed in a Superior Corner Suite.
The view of the city was the most amazing thing I had ever seen.
The rooms were very spacious and clean.
The king size bed was extremely comfortable.
The room did n't seem like we were in a hotel ; it had the feeling of home.
There was a separate living room area which was wonderful ; my husband and I just sat there one night and stared out the window at the skyline.
It was mesmerizing.
We ordered room service because we had a long day of shopping ; which the hotel is very convenient to a lot of great shopping.
Most everything is in walking distance.
The food was to die for ; it was as if we were eating at a 5 star fine dining restaurant.
We did manage to go down and have a few drinks in the lounge.
The lounge had a classy feel to it ; very relaxing yet sophisticated.
We even received a massage ; in our room.
While we did have all the conveniences of home ; such as internet and TV ; we did not even think about using them ; being that we just wanted to get away from our everyday lives.
This was the most romantic vacation my husband and I have ever taken.
I can not express how happy we were to have stayed in this hotel.
We had other options but I am so glad we decided to stay here.
The rate for the room was so inexpensive for the amount of luxury we were able to experience ; which the experience itself is priceless.
I will definitely share my experience with anyone and everyone and recommend this hotel.
First of all when you check in the check in process is smooth and takes no time at all ; the front desk is very friendly and kind and make sure you know where your room is.
Then on the way to your room they have spots with chairs and a table to have a seat and visit with other guest if you prefer to be out of you room.
The room it 's self is very spacious and clean.
The pool area is very clean and neat and you always have a towel ; they never seemed to run out.
The service is beyond exceptional.
I would recommend staying at Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown to anyone.
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding.
The service was impeccable.
Not only was the staff attentive ; they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner.
I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for ! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy.
They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests.
The amenities were great ; and after an open bar the night before ; the Mimosas and brunch buffet could n't have been better ! I would love to have my wedding there.
swissotel - My husband and I were visiting Chicago for our third anniversary.
We read a lot of the reviews beforehand and thought this would be a great place.
Unfortunately it did n't quite live up to the expectations.
The room was n't ready when we got there ; so we had to wait an extra 30 minutes.
The bed was very uncomfortable ; and the bathroom was unkept.
The only thing worse that the room was the food they served at the restaurant.
We had the seabass which gave my husband food poisoning for half of the trip.
The Talbott Hotel is a place to stay where the staff treat you like you are not welcome.
If you do not pay higher prices you are snubbed and the rooms are no classier or fancier than a standard motel.
The room service takes over an hour and there is constant traffic and construction outside.
The cost is far more than the luxury.
The best thing about staying at this hotel are the bathroom towels.
My family and I stayed here while we were visiting Chicago.
This was a perfect location to many of the things we wanted to do and was easy to get around.
It was in a safe neighborhood and was great accomodations.
The staff was friendly and went the " extra mile " to make sure we had everything we needed.
The beds were comfortable.
We would definitely stay here again.
I have visited Chicago with my family several times and have never had such a HORRIBLE hotel experience ! The staff was rude and unhelpful ; and they overcharged my card by more than $ 300 ! I had to spend the whole morning on the phone trying to get them to finally fix their mistake.
The hotel itself did n't live up to our expectations either ... the inside was dingy and needed cleaning ; and our room looked like a bunch of chain smokers had just thrown a crazy party in the room.
There were cigarette burns on the sheets ; stains on the floor ; and there was a hole in the wall where it looked like someone had punched it ! We requested another room ; which was only marginally better in terms of cleanliness ; only to be kept up all night from the noise of our neighbors yelling and hanging out in the hallway.
There are plenty of other places to stay in Chicago.
AVOID Hard Rock at all costs ! talbotthotel - First trip to Chicago ; found the Talbott online.
Good location ; easy access to public transportation as well as a short walk to Washington Square Park.
Rooms were large and well-decorated ; with tall windows and granite countertops in the bathrooms.
The hotel restaurant was n't cheap but the food was surprisingly good ; and our waitress was very nice.
Overall ; I 'd recommend the Talbott.
Hotel Allegro I can not say enough about how terrible my experience was at this hotel.
Upon arriving ; I waited a long time for the lobby receptionist to give me the key to my room.
When I finally arrived at my room ; it was obvious to me that the room had not been cleaned properly.
The food downstairs was nothing to rave about either.
The main course came out cold ; and the waiter was pretty rude.
I will definitely NOT be coming back to Hotel Allegro.
Last time I stayed in this city ; I went to the Holiday Inn which was much better ! The hard rock hotel Chicago is not as good as they try to portray ; First ill start off by saying there website is confusing and hard to navigate through.
They also have rude customer service ; that dont seem happy to answer your questions.
There prices are so outrageously expensive for what they offer ; its just ridiculous.
Hard rock hotel has a good rep behind there name ; but Hard rock hotel Chicago should not be included in that.
The Knickerbocker hotel was one of my favorite hotels to visit.
My wife and I utilized the park play package ; which gave us an amazing room ; complimentary valet service ; and a great kit to plan our weekend around.
It was well worth the price and we both wish to go back again.
The rooms were top notch and the hotel 's staff was excellent.
One of the employees ; Craig ; helped us find our way around the city and this shows the Knickerbocker really cares about its guests.
We loved our visit and are sure you will too.
A I stayed with my husband at the Homewood Suites in Chicago.
We wanted to do something nice for our anniversary and thought that the Hilton was a solid name brand and expected to have a pleasant stay.
Unfortunately this was not the case ! The staff was very rude at check-in ' which took 20 minutes and the lobby smelled musky and gross.
The room itself was not like other Hilton hotels I have stayed at.
The carpeting was atrocious and the color of vomit ; the room smelled of smoke ' even though it 's advertised as smoke-free and there were a few long brown hairs in our bed ! I was so grossed out that I had to call down to the rude staff to ask for our linens to be changed and they gave us a huge attitude about it.
And do n't even get me started on how poorly the shower 'bathtub worked .. a nice anniversary went totally awry due to how crummy this hotel is.
If I could give it 0 stars ; I would ! My wife and I booked a Deluxe Accessible Room at this beautiful hotel for three nights.
The wonderful photos do n't do the hotel justice.
It could n't have been a more ideal stay.
The room was spacious and and clean ; the bathroom sparkling ; with every amenity one could imagine.
The bed felt like it had been just delivered.
Our views of downtown Chicago were spectacular.
On top of all of this ; the hotel staff was extremely helpful.
They explained the best routes to the restaurants we wanted to eat at ; and they even went as far as securing us reservations for the places they knew would be busy ! Believe everything good that you read.
If you visit Chicago ; stay at the Conrad Chicago.
My stay at the Hyatt Regency was an experience that I 'll never ever forget - not in a good way.
Check-in was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant.
I went up to my room and looked around ; all seemed ok at first.
I was bushed so I flopped on the bed ...  ohhhhh noooooo ! The bed was as hard as a military bunk from my Army days.
But I was so tired that I just passed out.
Of course I woke up with a back ache ... great.
I figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so I plugged the tub ; turned the hot water on full force ; and poured in some shower gel.
I put my foot in expecting some real heat - the water was barely lukewarm.
I called the front desk but they were no help ; the clerk just apologized.
Frustrated at this point ; I turned on the tv and switched on the air.
I put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and I saw something slimy inside of the vent.
It looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something.
I could n't take anymore of this.
I went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk.
It seemed as though the guy was on something - he kept smiling as he apologized ; no empathy as if he 's used to hearing about the goop in the ac.
He offered me a free night but there is no way that I 'd stay at this place again - ever.
The Conrad Chicago is a Michelin rated hotel ; so I was expecting great service and wonderful accommodations.
Well ; only one part of that was correct.
The rooms are indeed nicely furnished ; but the service was terrible ! The concierge was unable to find my room reservation ' I reserved online and even had the email confirmation and was n't very helpful in getting me a new room.
I ordered room service ; and the wait time was so long that the food came up cold.
I mean ; I understand that it would take time to get the food prepared and up to my room ; but really ? For the price I paid ; it was definitely not worth it ; and I would never use this hotel again.
My wife and I decided to stay at the Amalfi while we visited friends in Chicago ; we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this ' Luxury hotel to any of our friends.
Amalfi claims that your stay begins with a ' warm greeting ; but we received the exact opposite.
The front desk clerk was rude ; sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question ; and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room.
Apparently there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog ; who we had to bring at the last minute.
The room on the Pet Floor was alright ; nothing spectacular ; and unfortunately had a slight scent of covered-up dog urine.
We proceeded to dinner at Keefer 's Restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time.
I have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire ; opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant.
The next day ; I could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly ; and had to finish some work at our friend 's house.
My wife had called for some extra towels and pillows ; which took about half an hour to receive.
She also ordered breakfast because Breakfast in Bed WAS her favorite- until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them.
We were set to stay for 3 days ; but only managed to stay 2.
We will not be staying here again.
The Downtown Chicago Hilton was the best combination of all the things we were looking for in a hotel- perfect location for both those of us who like shopping and those of us who prefer tourist attractions.
Staying with a Hilton means the essentials are never a concern- as always ; the room was clean and impeccably neat ; the staff friendly and very capable.
The wireless access and big flat screen TV were an added plus too ! Best of all ; it is a pet-friendly hotel ; something that is unusual in bigger city 4-diamond hotels.
Thanks ; Chicago Hilton ; for a great stay ! Intercontinential Chicago Hotel - This hotel is amazing.
I usually have pretty high standards for hotels ; but this hotel has exceeded even my expectations.
It is right in downtown Chicago and close to several really well known restaurants.
The rooms are gorgeous ; the bathroom is so spacious and the room was laid out such that it felt very spacious.
The view from the window was amazing and the management was top notch.
I was n't sure what to expect when I read the reviews but I took a chance and booked a room ; I 'm really glad I did ! We really enjoyed our stay ! It is a beautiful hotel and the entire staff is helpful and polite.
They had great suggestions on where to eat ; what to do ; etc.
We were within walking distance of many great Chicago locations like the Navy Pier and Art Institute.
The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable ; I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great home away from home in Chicago.
I have no idea why this is considered a four star hotel.
The Omni Chicago 's age shows ; and not in a " great ambiance " way ! The rooms are dingy and just plain worn looking.
I say rooms because we had to switch our original room as there was a terrible musty odor ; almost like mildew ; that permeated the first room we were given.
Seriously ; it brought tears to my eyes ! The staff seemed rather indifferent to our dilemma ; but finally agreed to switch us to another room.
The new one did n't smell ; but was clearly past its prime.
Housekeeping was almost nonexistent.
We had to call them back both days of our trip to empty the trash and for towels.
How can you forget to leave towels for the guests ? I 'm not one to complain ; but for the kind of money we spent for a weekend here ; we were expecting at least a little luxury and special treatment.
We received neither and will not be returning to the Omni Chicago.
My stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel was wonderful ! I had a last minute business trip ; in downtown Chicago ; and this is the first place I looked at.
I looked at the pictures they show online of the rooms ; and the facility itself ; and I simply fell in love with the place.
The indoor pool ; outdoor sun decks ; massages ; this place really has all you could possibly need ; whether you 're on vacation ; or needing a little stress relieved from a busy week.
I mean they even have high speed wireless internet ! I would definitely recommend the Omni Chicago Hotel ; if you want a great place to stay near Downtown Chicago ! To whom this may concern ; my name is Jamie Brown ; and i was a recent guest of yours between July 4th through July 10th ; and your staff made my stay so comfortable i almost didnt want to leave.
The Kitchen in the room and the complimentary grocery shopping service made me rethink leaving all together and when i didnt feel like cooking the complimentary welcome home dinner with a glass of wine ; helped me clear my mind for all the paper work i had to look forward to.
The free wireless internet access both in my room and sitting by the pool helped get all that done and helped me get my laps in as well.
I really could n't have asked for anything more ! I felt like a queen and I never though I could feel that way just staying in a hotel.
I thank you so very much for treating me so kindly and I will gladly be visiting you again very soon ; only for more pleasure and way less business.
Sincerely yours ; Jamie Brown A few nights ago ; I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in the Theater District of Chicago.
I 'd heard some amazing things about the great food ; and how friendly the staff were.
Upon arrival ; the service at the front desk and the bellman was fantastic ! They treated me as if I stayed there all the time ! The rooms were cozy ; with very comfortable beds that helped me sleep through my jet lag.
I ordered breakfast the next morning ; and had room service bring it up.
The meal was brought up only a few minutes after ordering ; and was delicious ! I would recommend these accommodations for anyone traveling ; or any families staying in Chicago ; as the rooms were very reasonably priced ; and is a short distance to lots of great sites.
Next time I come through Chicago ; I will definitely be staying here ! Chicago Hotels : The Sheraton Chicago Hotel Towers - First ; the Sheraton Chicago is definitely in a fantastic location.
It 's right next to the river and only a few blocks from the lake.
In the other direction its right next to Michigan Avenue so we could walk to almost everything we wanted to see.
The hotel 's accommodations were also great.
The bathroom and bed are quite comfortable and also clean.
On the downside the internet was not free and the fridge automatically charges you when moving items so I was not able to put my drinks inside but I would still highly recommend this hotel.
Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital.
We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here.
At first once coming into the room ; there was a mildewy smell in the air ; which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase.
The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well.
The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all.
To make matters even worse ; the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon ; when my wife was back from exploring the city.
This was simply unacceptable by any standard.
This hotel was worth every cent.
You have not experienced Chicago luxury until you have stayed here.
In town for a conference ; my colleagues and I never had to leave our hotel for much of anything.
Fine dining ; entertainment ; you name it : Knickerbocker 's got it ! I will definitely return as my wife and I frequent Chicago to visit family.
My husband and I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago and we ca n't wait to go back ! The hotel is located in downtown Chicago and seems to be at the heart of the city ; we were close to everything.
The Hard Rock Hotel is forty stories high and the view from our room was simply breathtaking.
The room itself was spotless and featured modern luxurious decor and furnishings.
The bed was heavenly.
The hotel staff was friendly ; upbeat and extremely helpful ; we asked for directions and restaurant recommendations and they were spot on with both.
I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago and I would stay there again in a heartbeat.
Hilton Chicago - The room itself was n't anything too special ; but the view of the lake was great.
Some noise could be heard from the neighbors but it did n't prove to be too much problem.
What made the Hilton Chicago hotel great are the exceptional dining options they offer and the various activities you can do here ranging from swimming to fitness and visiting the aquarium or museum.
I stayed in on of The James one bedroom apartments for two weeks while in Chicago visiting my daughter.
The pre-arrival assistant was incredibly helpful in acquiring some necessities I forgot to pack and left them in my room for me.
Later in the week I treated myself to an Asha Massage from their lengthy list of delicious spa services.
Afterward I smelled wonderful and was the most relaxed I 'd been in years.
My room was clean and modern ; yet warm and comforting with dark wood tones and lush bedding.
I 'll certainly be staying with them again in the future.
http : 'www.amalfihotelchicago.com - The Amalfi Hotel is a wonderful ; decently priced ; experience.
The rooms are large ; pleasent and comfortable.
The hotel provides free wifi and DVDs ; which is a plus ; but the movie selection is rather lacking ; mostly comprised of children 's films.
Breakfast was simply the best food I 've had in a long time.
Highly recommended ! The Palmer House Hilton ; while it looks good in pictures ; and the outside ; is actually a disaster of a hotel.
When I went through ; the lobby was dirty ; my room had n't been cleaned ; and smelled thoroughly of smoke.
When I requested more pillows ; the lady on the phone scoffed at me and said she 'd send them up.
It took over an hour for 2 pillows.
This hotel is a good example that what you pay for is n't always what you get.
I will not be returning.
The Omni Chicago Hotel is not pretty as they advertise it.
First of all ; it really difficult to get there because its located in down town Chicago and they fail to mention that the traffic is a nightmare.
If you finally make to the hotel you have to wait like 30 minutes for the front desk to take care of you.
When I arrived there was one person at the desk and a few people checking in ; and I thought the wait time was ridiculous.
To make matters worse ; I need internet connection and the day I was there they had technical problems and the Internet was not working in my room.
Two hours later they managed it get to work ; the connection was still very slow.
For my part ; the hotel might look nice but services is did not meet my expectations.
I was disappointed and will never stay there again ; if I go back to Chicago.
If was rating it ; I would give it 1 '2 star out of 5.
My family stayed at this hotel and walking into the Lobby I expected a very good experience.
Once I made my way to the counter and was Greeted ' Not Really I knew this may be a bad experience.
The Customer Service Person was rude and did not wait on me for a few minutes.
Once I got up to the room it looked like someone had just checked out.
The High Chair that we requested still had spots of food on it.
The Rest Room had water on the counter and very little toilet paper.
After we got settled we went down to the dining room for supper and was disappointed in the service and the food quality for the price we paid.
Luckily we only had to stay there one day.
One day was almost too long.
the James Hotel in Chicago is by far one of the best hotels that My family and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at.
The room service is the best in the area ; not to mention the spa in the hotel is to die for.
The lobby and the reception area is very contemporary.
This is a great place to take the family to relax.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
5 stars ! I just got home from my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel.
Me and my family were in Chacago for the the week and this hotel was the closest to where we needed to be.
When we walked in the door there was a horrid odor.
Almost like a public bathroom.
The check in clerk was very irritable and was very uncooperative.
She would not let us go to our rooms because our entire family was not there yet ! When we finally got to our rooms the beds were not made and the room was uninviting.
The beds felt like we were sleeping on rocks.
After the first dreadful night we got up and went downstairs to eat breakfast.
The food there tastes and looks like vomit.
The rest of the weeks stay there was like living in Hell.
The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel is definitely not a good place to stay.
It is actually probably on of the worst hotels I 've ever stayed at.
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago back in July.
For a " luxury " hotel this place did not meet my expectations.
For starters ; we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room would n't be ready for at least another hour ! I 'm used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee.
Since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel 's restaurants ; Kitty O 'Sheas.
Well ; we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks.
Once we finally got to our room it was OK ; although not great for the price.
We had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view ; and there were not extra towels as I had requested.
We had to call room service twice to receive them ; then another two times because our air conditioner was n't working.
Fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so I could barely use internet on my phone.
Next time I 'm in the Chicago area I wo n't be staying at the Hilton.
I 'd only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money.
My experience at the Hyatt Regency Chicago was simply amazing.
I had a wonderful stay there will my husband.
My husband has allergy problems nearly everywhere we go ; and we were worried about that so we talked to the desk clerk there.
They were able to provide us with a Hyatt allergy-friendly room.
We were so relieved and the room was beautiful.
The furniture in the room was actually cleaned with pure tea tree oil.
It was the most comfortable stay we have ever had.
On top of that my husband had to spend some time in the room working on some business ; so the high speed internet they provided was very convenient.
We took full advantage of the 24 hour room service.
I will definitely stay there again.
It is a vacation simply staying in your hotel room.
