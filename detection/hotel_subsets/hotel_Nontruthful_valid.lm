<s> Hotel Chicago - We stayed at Amalfi Hotel Chicago last July for a weekend. </s>

<s> were comfortable and staff was polite and very helpful. </s>
<s> especially enjoyed the great continental breakfast ; which was offered in a nice and shiny hall. </s>
<s> this hotel has a good selection of dishes for lunch and dinner. </s>
<s> only complain is that we had to wait in a queue for about 10 minutes to check in on arrival day but this was minor issue given the great experience we had at Amalfi. </s>
<s> will definitely stay again at this nice hotel when we are back in Chicago next summer. </s>
<s> chose to stay at the Hilton Chicago because it was in such a centralized location- everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close ! What I did n't expect was for the beds to be so comfortable. </s>
<s> ca n't remember when I got a better night 's sleep. </s>
<s> staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept. </s>
<s> 'll be returning to the Hilton Chicago the next time we 're in town ! My family and I recently attended a wedding in Chicago and stayed at the Swissotel. </s>
<s> was much nicer than we expected. </s>
<s> are used to staying at mid-class hotels and this ; by far ; was one of the nicest places we 've stayed. </s>
<s> beds were so comfortable and the crib the provided for my infant son was great quality - I was concerned that we would get a rickety 1970s crib ! The bed sheets were so soft that I wanted to take them home ! We will definitely go back to this hotel the next time we are in Chicago. </s>
<s> should I start ? Well ; after staying at the Ambassador East Hotel ; i realized it was my favorite hotel ever. </s>

<s> are comfortable and the room looks like it was recently renovated. </s>
<s> the thing that really stood out was the teamwork of such a wonderful staff. </s>
<s> will be back to the Homewood Suites the next time we come to Chicago ! On our first trip to Chicago ; my fiance and I stayed 2 nights on our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised by the Hotel and the service we received from the personnel. </s>
<s> the past from other " luxury hotels " we have paid much more and received much less. </s>
<s> the room were very spacious ; comfortable and sleek. </s>
<s> spent come time in the hotel bar ; LE BAR ; and enjoyed a few of their specialty martinis that were second to none ! We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel 's Cafe des Architectes and received service some of the best service in quite some time. </s>
<s> traveling with a lover we recommend the " Air of Romance " package. </s>
<s> was the best ! 6 stars ! I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago. </s>
<s> higher priced ; the reviews online plus four stars convinced me. </s>
<s> the hotel itself is beautiful ; but looks can be deceiving. </s>
<s> pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey. </s>
<s> restaurant ' Cafe Des Architect had amazing food ; so that was a plus ; but the service was awful. </s>
<s> had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water ! My remote would n't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud. </s>
<s> hotel must 've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night. </s>
<s> housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently. </s>
<s> called twice for more fresh towels. </s>
<s> I wanted this type of experience ; I 'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel. </s>
<s> experience ; less money ! If you are looking for a luxurious downtown Chicago experience ; the Conrad Chicago is the place to stay. </s>
<s> rooms are equipped with the most comfortable beds dressed with the most luxurious bedding ; a 42 inch flat screen television ; a spa like bathroom with marble vanity and soaking tub ; and views of downtown Chicago that will take your breath away. </s>

<s> hotel was a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality place to stay in downtown Chicago. </s>
<s> I planned my summer vacation ; I was wanting to travel somewhere new. </s>
<s> was on my mind because of the fast city life. </s>
<s> got in a flight to Chicago and arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel. </s>
<s> was grand and I spent a total of 4 days and nights there. </s>
<s> luxury was exotic and the location was right around the corner from most shopping and dining venues. </s>
<s> room service had me drooling because the food was so delicious ; I could hardly picture not feeling satisfied. </s>
<s> met up with a few of my friends and they offered me a tour around town. </s>
<s> enjoyed the stay there and will come back sooner than later. </s>
<s> Ambssador East Hotel - They were out of rooms with king-sized beds when I checked in ; so I was stuck with a small bed in a room with two beds. </s>
<s> did n't even receive any compensation for the trouble. </s>
<s> usually rely on the light to wake me up in the morning ; but I made the mistake of sleeping on the bed further away from the windows ; so I woke up late the next day. </s>
<s> bathroom 's big enough ; but housekeeping does n't replenish the supplies everyday ; which is annoying. </s>
<s> restaurant 's too expensive ; so I was forced to leave the hotel to get dinner. </s>
<s> would n't stay here again on my own money. </s>
<s> wife and I stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it. </s>
<s> atmosphere was very chic upscale ; in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank. </s>
<s> wife even got to bring along her dog ' aka ' 1 man !. </s>
<s> would definitely stay here again would recommend it to anyone staying in the Chicago area. </s>
<s> recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for business ; but extended my stay through the weekend because i loved it ! The accommodations exceeded my expectations. </s>
<s> bed was very comfortable ; the room was big enough ; and the shower was so relaxing. </s>
<s> had a great meal in the chop shop and the coffee was delicious at J 's express. </s>
<s> fitness center was clean ; and inspiring. </s>
<s> will recommend this hotel to others while in the area. </s>
<s> is the best word to describe the Conrad Chicago hotel. </s>
<s> it may be in downtown Chicago ; the room had no view. </s>
<s> I asked for non-smoking ; the room reeked of smoke. </s>
<s> elevators were very slow ; and one was not working during my stay. </s>
<s> was a stain on the pillow ; and the leg of one of the chairs in the room was broken. </s>
<s> was a dead bug in the bath tub. </s>
<s> was only given 2 towels for my 4 night stay. </s>
<s> credit card was billed twice ; and it took 2 weeks to reverse to extra charge. </s>
<s> do not recommend this hotel at all ! I stayed in the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago last week ; and I was extremely disappointed with my experience. </s>
<s> breakfast buffet was minimal and did not seem to be frequently restocked. </s>
<s> came downstairs about 30 minutes before the end of the breakfast period to find about half of the food options completely depleted. </s>
<s> ; the milk provided for the coffee and cereals was warm ; having been kept out on the counter. </s>
<s> would have been better off bringing my own food ! Also ; the layout of the rooms is extremely awkward. </s>
<s> had to move the furniture around to be able to watch TV ; and then move it back before I could make dinner or comfortably use the room in other ways. </s>
<s> could barely close the door to the bedroom past the corner of the bed. </s>
<s> just was n't what I would expect from a Hilton-brand hotel suite. </s>
<s> went to the Homewood Suites in Chicago which is part of Hilton 's famous hotels. </s>
<s> gotta say that this is the worst hotel that I have ever been to. </s>
<s> fact ; Homewood Suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet. </s>
<s> checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape. </s>
<s> fact ; the rooms looked so bad that I wanted to leave the hotel early. </s>
<s> also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel. </s>
<s> saw one of the employees and when I rung the bell for my room ; they ignored me. </s>
<s> could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you ? One more thing that I hate about this hotel is that the logo did n't look like the actual logo. </s>
<s> looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw. </s>
<s> 'll never go to this hotel again and it wo n't even be in a million years for that matter. </s>
<s> is a hotel that I will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer. </s>
<s> searching for the perfect hotel for my Chicago getaway I knew once I came across the Hard Rock Hotel ; that this was the hotel for me. </s>
<s> seeing the exceptional accommodations the hotel offered ; I booked my reservations right away. </s>
<s> I arrived at the hotel I was astonished at how beautiful and big the building and grounds were kept. </s>
<s> was greeted warmly by the front staff and received my room key within a few minutes. </s>
<s> was also given helpful pointers to nearby attractions and restaurants. </s>
<s> took the elevator up to my room ; and when I opened the door my jaw dropped as the views of the Chicago skyline was impeccable. </s>
<s> relaxing I went down to the bar for a few cocktails and was impressed by the fast ; courteous service I received. </s>
<s> my cocktail hour ; I decided to unwind and let me tell you the beds must be sent from heaven. </s>
<s> had one of the best nights of sleep I have had in a long time. </s>
<s> highly recommend the Hard Rock as I have stayed at many around the US and this is definitely on my top 5 list. </s>
<s> you all enjoy it as much as I did ; and I ca n't wait to return. </s>

<s> had originally chosen the Conrad Chicago Hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance. </s>
<s> ; I later learned that I had made a poor choice. </s>
<s> arrival ; the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk. </s>
<s> ; when we reached out hotel room ; we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one-bedroom suite. </s>
<s> family went back down to demand another room with two queen-size beds. </s>
<s> clerk ; after a twenty minute waiting period ; was able to find us a suitable room. </s>
<s> entering ; the room was noticably hot. </s>
<s> turned on the air conditioning ; and after waiting for thirty minutes ; the room remained muggy and humid. </s>
<s> called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room. </s>
<s> promised a repairman within ten minutes. </s>
<s> hour later I called again and remined them that the repairman had n't shown up. </s>
<s> once again promised a speedy repair. </s>
<s> waiting ; I discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp. </s>
<s> called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level ; but I had to go get them. </s>
<s> all this trouble ; I argued that they should bring it up to me ; but in the end ; I wound up going to get it myself. </s>
<s> returning to my room and waiting another 30 minutes ; the repair man had not shown up. </s>
<s> I called again ; and within 5 minutes the repairman came. </s>
<s> managed to fix the air conditioner ; but it was about 12am. </s>
<s> were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off ; but as the night went on ; we noticed another problem. </s>
<s> air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds. </s>
<s> also emitted a strange odor. </s>
<s> checking with the front desk ; we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired. </s>
<s> were not available rooms left ; and being so fed up with this hotel 's poor service ; we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel. </s>
<s> do n't recommend the Conrad Chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time. </s>
<s> Hotel Allegro Chicago - The hotel exterior makes it out to be an old cozy hotel which it certainly is not. </s>
<s> decorated the rooms went way over the top trying to incorporate a modern theme. </s>
<s> bathroom was really small ; not to mention very dated considering the amount of renovations to the rest of the room. </s>
<s> am not coming back. </s>
<s> was consistently disappointed throughout my stay at the James. </s>
<s> had heard from others that it was " agreeable " and " workable " and " all right ; " or even " a nice place. </s>

<s> to the website ; I was about to immerse myself and my date in a bath of cutting-edge contemporary furnishings and " warm tones. </s>
<s> " 
Well ; when I arrived ; I felt like I was in an Ikea showroom just before closing time on a busy day. </s>
<s> in the front was just a bit too askew. </s>
<s> staff were busy ; distracted ; inattentive ; and in every way keen to show me I was a bother to them. </s>
<s> handled my own bags far too much to be convinced of their commitment to my comfort. </s>
<s> also thought my room was quite pathetic for its price. </s>
<s> looked distinctly like someone had rolled around on the beds just before I got there. </s>
<s> bathroom fixtures felt a little bit gross and smelled very strongly ; inexplicably ; of men 's cologne. </s>
<s> cared when I complained of this and suggested that maybe it was just " stuck in my nose " and that it would go away. </s>
<s> ; it did n't ; and I had a horrible headache by the time my lady arrived. </s>
<s> ruined my entire first evening in Chicago. </s>
<s> my price I could have stayed a week at an economy hotel ; gotten my personal items treated for bedbugs ; and still saved money. </s>
<s> I would not have been treated like such a pest. </s>
<s> to say ; I will be looking elsewhere when I go back to Chicago. </s>
<s> may not be a frequent patron of luxury hotels ; but I know when I am wasting my money. </s>
<s> Omni Chicago- The Omni Chicago Hotel was one of the worst hotels I 've stayed in ! My husband and I went there last week for three days and we had a terrible experience. </s>
<s> dining room looked elegant and the food looked delicious ; but when we sat down for dinner I thought my chair was going to break ! Everything was cheap and old looking. </s>
<s> I ordered a vegetarian meal ; they gave me fish that was still cold and beans that were burnt. </s>
<s> the room looked elegant on the pictures ; I noticed that they had n't vacuumed under the table or the beds. </s>
<s> even found a sock from a previous guest in the closet ! The bathroom was too small and smelt moldy. </s>
<s> indoor pool was very crowded after dinner and was definitely not large enough for a hotel with 347 rooms. </s>
<s> were going to talk a walk along Michigan Avenue ; but when we got outside we noticed the lights on the sidewalk were n't working and it was completely dark. </s>
<s> will definitely never stay at the Hotel Omni Chicago again ! I was here on a weekend when there must have been a big convention or something ; because I could n't get a room at The James ; where I usually stay. </s>
<s> in ; the lobby was gaudy and poorly lit ; and the line to check in took forever. </s>
<s> elevators were tiny ; and about five more people than could actually fit squeezed their way in just before the door closed. </s>
<s> chair in the room was uncomfortable and really low to the ground- I had to pull my husband up out of it. </s>
<s> bathroom did n't have a bathtub ; only a shower ; and almost no room to put my toiletries to keep them organized. </s>
<s> fitness center has mirrors everywhere to make it look big ; but there were only about four treadmills ; and you bet that every single one was full whenever I tried to make it down there for exercise. </s>
<s> 's a bit closer to the Loop than the James ; but that did n't make up for its other problems. </s>
<s> wo n't be returning. </s>
<s> Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago- This hotel is fairly nice and has the expected accomodation for the price. </s>
<s> ; I booked this at the last moment and did n't have much chance to shop around for other deals. </s>
<s> the price ; there might be better alternatives. </s>
<s> was approximately $ 200 a night for a spacious studio room. </s>
<s> complaint however is that I was put into a room with renovations being done in the hallways. </s>
<s> created a nauseating smell everytime I left the room. </s>
<s> ; the staff was very nice and supported my needs. </s>
<s> had an interview the next day and the hotel was nice enough to provide shuttle service. </s>
<s> breakfast too was great ! It was n't just continental but had eggs and sausage and an assortment of pastries and beverages. </s>
<s> even had a computer room and printer for my printing needs. </s>
<s> a chance I would go back again ; assuming that I get assigned to a hallway not under renovation. </s>
<s> nice hotel ; better than expected. </s>
<s> hot breakfast is great in the morning ; but the Dinner at night goes above and beyond ' even free wine ! The rooms are pretty good size ; well furnished ; and clean. </s>
<s> liked the view from my room. </s>
<s> used the fitness center and although did not have everything I would have liked ; was adequate. </s>
<s> will say the pool is really nice and offers a pretty sweet view. </s>
<s> staff was friendly and helpful ; being my first time in Chicago they were able to point me in the right direction and saved me some frustration. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> was REALLY looking forward to a nice relaxing stay at the end of a long vacation ; but unfortunately that was not to be had. </s>
<s> the moment we arrived at the Omni ; the staff was belligerent and extremely rude. </s>
<s> had lost our reservation and refused to give us the rate we had booked before. </s>
<s> we were n't so tired ; we would 've gone to a different hotel right then ; but hindsight is 20 '20. </s>
<s> we FINALLY got checked in after being made to wait needlessly for 45 minutes in the lobby ; we decided to go down to the pool ; which was tiny and kind of dirty ; so we had walked all the way down there in our suits for nothing. </s>
<s> internet access was really slow. </s>
<s> will NEVER stay here again. </s>
<s> yourself the headache and book somewhere else ! I was initially excited when I found out that my employer was sending me to Chicago on business ; but I could never have imagined the frustration and irritation that would be heaped on me by the inept staff of The James Chicago. </s>
<s> I arrived ; my reservation could not be found in their system ; although I had made it myself. </s>
<s> some words with the manager on duty ; Mr. </s>
<s> Chad Montgomery ; I was given a room at the previously agreed upon rate. </s>
<s> can make a mistake ; so I was n't too angry at that point. </s>
<s> room was bland and colorless ; in spite of The James boasts of their attention to design and detail. </s>
<s> room was mostly clean ; but after seeing the stains on the bedding ; I am not convinced that they were washed after the room 's last occupant. </s>
<s> attended a stressful business meeting in The Dining Room that night ; complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy ; disgruntled waitstaff. </s>
<s> I decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order. </s>
<s> was assured that I would enjoy " Asha 's Purifying Shower Ritual " ; which would primarily take place in my own room. </s>
<s> shower was okay ; but I think I must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided ; because I broke out in hives all over my body. </s>
<s> came the " in-room " portion. </s>
<s> I was in the shower ; five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room. </s>
<s> guess they were supposed to make it smell good ; but I began choking on the odor the minute I walked in the room. </s>
<s> masseuse directed me to lie on the bed for the next portion ; but his hands wandered a little too much for my liking. </s>
<s> am sure certain areas are NOT on the massage menu. </s>
<s> closing ; if you have ever considered staying at The James Chicago ; I beg of you to reconsider. </s>
<s> only a handful of positive things to say about the hotel ; and a suitcase full of negative ' including a pending court case against the masseuse ; I can almost guarantee you would regret staying there. </s>
<s> know I do. </s>
<s> Suites Chicago I travel to Chicago a lot and have never been as impressed with a hotel as I am with Homewood Suites Chicago. </s>
<s> I stepped into my room ; I was immediately hit with the Chicago skyline. </s>
<s> was easily accessible in the wonderful restaurant next to the lobby. </s>
<s> took my family to the Affinia Chicago for a short vacation last summer and it was fabulous. </s>
<s> kids say that their favorite part was the pool and the fact that the amusement park is really close by. </s>
<s> wife was really stoked with Spaffina. </s>
<s> pampering and really made her feel special. </s>
<s> they are very attentive to pets also. </s>
<s> dog we left home but he would have been stoked with the pets amenities and attention. </s>
<s> hotel is also connected to a ton of other hotels ; so their Stash award lets you earn points at a lot of other hotels also. </s>
<s> favorite part of all was that my family was happy and content ; which left me free to go over to Underground Wonderbar for a nice cocktail. </s>
<s> most people think Hilton ; they think luxury. </s>
<s> know I did. </s>
<s> only wish I 'd been half right. </s>
<s> arriving ; I was informed that the incompetent staff had lost my reservation entirely. </s>
<s> a very auspicious start ; but they did find me another room. </s>
<s> ; the new room had an oh-so-scenic view of the broadside of an adjacent building. </s>
<s> ; fine. </s>
<s> was willing to let this slide. </s>
<s> did n't want to be difficult. </s>
<s> the following days of my stay ; it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the Hilton very undeserving of the term ; luxury hotel. </s>
<s> neighbors. </s>
<s> staff. </s>
<s> the state of my bathroom towels was anything to go by upon checkout ; I doubt my sheets were changed even once. </s>
<s> time I 'll ignore the hype and stay somewhere cheaper. </s>
<s> service could n't possibly be worse. </s>
<s> no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas. </s>
<s> notably is cleanliness ; as although the lobby was very clean ; the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not. </s>
<s> lined the carpeted floor for the hallways ; and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time. </s>
<s> furnishings were nice and modern ; but with various blemishes upon close inspection. </s>
<s> was relatively clean ; with the exception of the shower. </s>
<s> was nice for this particular room ; and service was relatively quick. </s>
<s> food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue. </s>
<s> time with the glasses which were stained ; the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel. </s>
<s> will not make the mistake of staying here again. </s>
<s> was really an unexpected experience for me as far as hotel accommodations go. </s>
<s> this week 's vacation in Chicago ; I heard several recommendations regarding lodging ; but the James Chicago was mentioned most emphatically. </s>
<s> expected an experience of comfort ; luxury and customer satisfaction ; but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of innovation and forward-thinking employed by every aspect of this hotel. </s>
<s> design is breathtaking -- modern ; clean ; stylish ; sexy -- and its reflected everywhere from the lobby ; shops and restaurants ; to the stunning guest rooms themselves. </s>
<s> family and I felt energized by the smartly sleek environment we were in ; and were impressed at every turn by the sophisticated take on hotel decor. </s>
<s> from a traditional hotel experience ; this was like moving into chic ; exclusive downtown apartment ; and truly an upscale adventure in modern luxury living. </s>
<s> ; too ; was the hotel 's overall approach to its guests and its use of the world 's resources. </s>
<s> its offer of in-room recycling to the available bicycles for guest usage ; the James offers a unique perspective on its place in the world ; and gently helps its guests assist in maintaining that balance with ease and elegance. </s>
<s> 's a respect that shows through ; too ; in other areas : support for artistic organizations ; charities and other programs of merit ; as well as Chicago-centric packages compiled for guests so they can make the best of their stay ; whether for a weekend ; a week ; or longer. </s>
<s> James Chicago will definitely be our choice for accommodations whenever we revisit Chicago. </s>
<s> fact ; we may visit again solely to stay at the James ! Hilton Chicago - I may be biased because my expectation for this Hilton hotel was high ; but $ 150 a night for an ordinary hotel room with no extra special services seems a bit pricey for me. </s>
<s> from the price ; the noise was also a big issue for me. </s>
<s> could n't get enough sleep with all the noise coming from traffic in the morning. </s>
<s> staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently ; I was nothing but disappointed. </s>
<s> " luxury hotel " obviously spends too much money on their marketing to convince people how luxurious they are and not enough on actually making their hotel comfortable. </s>
<s> I arrived ; my hotel room was devoid of towels ; and after calling down to the front desk ; it took three hours and two more calls to finally get some fresh towels delivered. </s>
<s> top of that ; when I went to connect to the internet in my room ; the wifi signal was too weak and I was forced to go out into the hall to connect with my laptop ! For the exorbitant price they charged me for one night in their " superior corner suite " ; I could have stayed a week at a Holiday Inn ; and after this stay ; I wish I had. </s>
<s> Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago- Horrible service. </s>
<s> and lacking in service. </s>
<s> are much better places to go in town. </s>
<s> I first heard about this place ; I had my doubts but decided to bite the bullet and go for the pricy choice. </s>
<s> was on a trip with family and wanted to splurge on the accomodations. </s>
<s> ; when I came to the hotel ; my expectations were far from being met. </s>
<s> pictures posted online were deceptive and hid most of the flaws in the hotel. </s>
<s> bathroom had mold all over and was really disgusting ! I asked for a new room but was rudely denied. </s>
<s> people only care about profit and not the service. </s>
<s> you are considering to room here ; do n't ! Do yourself a favor and go to the hotel next doors. </s>
<s> 's much better and is actually cheaper. </s>
<s> next day ; I left the hotel and went next doors ! My wife and I stayed at the Abassador East Hotel in August to attend the Air and Water Show in Chicago. </s>
<s> called ahead to ensure a SW view that would allow us to watch the airshow from our room if the weather did not permit us to watch from one of the nearby beaches. </s>
<s> arrival at the hotel ; not only was our room on the west side of the hotel it was n't even a single king as was requested. </s>
<s> the hotel had overbooked king rooms for the event weekend and we were downgraded to a queen room. </s>
<s> room itself was small and underwhelming. </s>
<s> was not dirty ; but the linens and furnishings all had a very old and worn feel. </s>
<s> hotel was packed the weekend we visited. </s>
<s> staff was obviously not prepared to cater to such a large crowd. </s>
<s> concierge and reception desks were continuously busy. </s>
<s> hotel restaurant was very slow and had long waits. </s>

<s> I can say is YUCK ! My next visit to the lobby the staff gave me an attitude about having to transfer me to another room AGAIN ! Extremely poor customer service and gross rooms. </s>
<s> felt like I was staying at a $ 30 a night roach motel ; not the $ 250 a night Sheraton. </s>
<s> advise is to stay away. </s>

<s> modern design of the lobby and restaurant with wood and glass creates a luxurious atmosphere and the streamlined ; comfortable room design give an upscale aesthetic like that of a penthouse loft apartment. </s>

<s> James is definately a hotel that I would recommend and will go back to in years to come. </s>

<s> was my first trip to Chicago and I had no idea what to expect and this hotel came recommended by a colleague so I had high expectations. </s>
<s> took a bit longer than I would have liked as they were experiencing computer problems and the staff at the front desk had to call their main reservation line to confirm reservations. </s>

<s> was determined not to let computer problems color my opinion of the hotel as it 's not something that is necessarily under the control of local management. </s>
<s> ; the hair in the bathroom sink and the wet washcloth that was on the floor behind the toilet are definitely under the control of local management. </s>

<s> Regency Chicago seemed like a nice place to stay ; but we did n't like it very much. </s>

The staff was RUDE ! I was trying to find a good cab service ; and the guy behind the front desk made me wait for 20 minutes while he was finishing a phone call ! Could n't he have at least called someone else to help me ? The " Babies Travel Lite " gave us the wrong sized diapers ; so we had to go find some anyway ; and with the hotel being located in the heart of the city that meant we found some unsavory characters along the way. </s>
<s> Chicago Water Tower I stayed at Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for a weekend last September. </s>

<s> arrived just one hour earlier than the check-in time ; but I was not allowed to check in ; so I had to leave my luggage at the reception area and walk around on the street to pass the time. </s>
<s> ; the weather was good so I enjoyed my walk. </s>
<s> room was cleaned nicely ; but I was on the third floor so I did n't have any view of the city. </s>
<s> was free internet access ; but the speed was extremely slow and made it almost impossible for me to work and communicate online. </s>
<s> tried several times and finally gave up. </s>
<s> bathroom was certainly large ; but I did not enjoy the shower due to the low water pressure coming out of the shower head. </s>
<s> part that I was most frustrated by was the cleaning lady who came early in the morning around 8am ' despite my DO NOT DISTURB sign ; and I was woken up by her knocking on the door. </s>

<s> Omni Chicago- My husband and I stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a long weekend last April. </s>

<s> was nothing missing ! Our dinner was also amazing. </s>

<s> we went to the pool after dinner we were the only people there so we were able to enjoy the peace and quiet. </s>
<s> we went back to our rooms we enjoyed a long walk along Michigan Avenue ; passing by the shops ; park and the art museum. </s>
<s> would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a wonderful stay in Chicago ! A recent stay at the James Hotel-Chicago ; revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only. </s>
<s> the rooms and public areas look nice ; the hotel still needs serious work. </s>
<s> first room was not clean when we arrived and this non-smoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke. </s>
<s> asked for a new room which was clean and odor free. </s>
<s> had to involve the Manager before our request was granted. </s>
<s> new room was better at first glance ; but was severely lacking. </s>
<s> could not get the temperature properly regulated. </s>
<s> room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay. </s>
<s> a hotel commanding the rates of the James ; we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted ; not something which is a constant battle. </s>
<s> mattress was horribly uncomfortable. </s>
<s> the rooms were updated ; the James skipped new mattresses. </s>
<s> was worn to the point of having indentations you ca n't get out of -- when you lie down ; you sort of sink into a hole. </s>
<s> matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a ' luxury hotel. </s>
<s> ; but not least ; we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay. </s>
<s> spite of the calming decor ; the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good night 's sleep. </s>
<s> in all ; we were unhappy with our accommodations at the James Chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location. </s>

<s> and it 's just walking distance from all the popular food places and clubs . </s>
<s>  all the places to be at least When you 're paying over $ 350 'night for a hotel ; you 'd expect a world-class experience and amenities. </s>
<s> ; I got no such thing during my stay. </s>
<s> ; they have tons of space and features like a ballroom ; gym ; and bars ; as well as a great location within walking distance of the Navy Pier. </s>
<s> the pros end there. </s>
<s> was honestly disappointed with our standard-sized room ; which definitely made you feel like a second-class citizen compared to the club level guests. </s>
<s> was a shower but no bathtub ; the room was on the small side ; and I did n't even get a lake-facing room. </s>
<s> I opened the pre-stock fridge I was disgusted to see nothing but expired fruit inside. </s>
<s> mean ; do they even inspect the rooms at all ? Worst of all ; however ; was an air vent near the bed that constantly let in unwanted noise at night. </s>
<s> tried to contact the hotel manager about it ; but all he offered were points in their loyalty program. </s>
<s> useless ! Outside the room there were problems as well. </s>
<s> ; there 's a pool ; but the water was absolutely freezing ; and to make matters worse ; I was unable to find a towel for over an hour ; and so here I was freezing my butt off waiting to dry off. </s>
<s> gym was ok ; but was very small and dirty looking with way too many treadmills and not enough weights. </s>
<s> 'd much rather go for a run outside by the beautiful lake ; admittingly one of the finer points of Chicago. </s>

<s> a recent work trip to Chicago I stayed at The James hotel and I ca n't say I would recommend it for anyone trying to get work done while staying there. </s>

<s> Hard Rock certainly delivered what we were looking for. </s>
<s> hotel is in a central location ; within easy reach of the main tourist spots in the city ; however ; there 's superb food on site and the best entertainment you could wish for ; so there 's barely a need to leave to hotel !

<s> Hotel ! Upscale and luxurious ; and in a great location ! Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff goes out of their way to treat guests like royalty !

<s> the hotel looks nice ; the service is terrible. </s>
<s> staff was rude and unprofessional and not helpful at all. </s>
<s> room service closes at 8pm so do n't plan on getting hungry after that time. </s>
<s> ; even though we stayed for a whole week we had to ask for new towels and extra toiletries. </s>
<s> will never go back to that place We had the pleasure of enjoying a stay at the Affinia Chicago Hotel. </s>
<s> found it conveniently located on E. </s>

<s> pillow menu was awesome ; my partner and I have such different preferences ; the choices made it easier to sleep like we were at home. </s>

<s> recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to travel in the area of an Affinia Hotel ! Best hotel in an excellent location I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower with my husband and kid as he came there for a Business purpose. </s>

<s> NY strip steak. </s>
<s> was pleasantly surprised that I slept through the night without being disturbed as I am a very light sleeper ; they must have lined the walls with noise-suppressing padding. </s>
<s> found only one annoyance : the shower head was a bit low-down 'c but what else can you expect when you 'fre six-foot-six. </s>
<s> Hotel - My family and I had a disappointing stay at the Talbott. </s>
<s> excellent location and reasonable rates are what drew us to this hotel ; but that was it. </s>
<s> from the location and rates ; everything was terrible. </s>
<s> rooms were very old and not at all modern and were very dimly lit. </s>
<s> checking the bathroom ; I saw that the shower head was rusted. </s>
<s> ; we were hardly able to sleep at night due to the loud construction noises coming from the street. </s>
<s> ; there is no gym facility available on site. </s>
<s> the most disappointing part of our stay was that we never got housekeeping services until we specifically asked for it. </s>
<s> would not recommend the Talbott at all. </s>
<s> yourself the frustration and stay somewhere else. </s>
<s> Hotel - We had the pleasure of staying at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> location makes it a gem as it is close to down town. </s>
<s> liked their novel idea of serving breakfast on every floor. </s>

<s> of all ; the hotel is all suites. </s>
<s> stayed in one of the " Premium Suites " . </s>
<s> accommodations were definitely luxurious ; with premium bedding ; very nice robes for our use ; and a choice of pillows. </s>
<s> used the hypo-allergenic ones ; but I believe you could have also chosen foam or feathers. </s>
<s> were pleased to find that the TV was plasma ; we have found that not all hotels have upgraded to plasma and we do n't wish to use one of the old-fashioned type of TVs anymore now that we are so used to plasma at home. </s>
<s> were actually two TVs in our suite. </s>
<s> were also some additional amenities that we appreciated such as high-speed internet access ; a wet bar ; an indoor swimming pool and two gorgeous sundecks for relaxing outside. </s>
<s> location was perfect as it was right in the midst of the Miracle Mile ; with so much to do practically at the Omni 's doorstep. </s>
<s> also treated myself to the Windy City Massage ; which was done in the comfort and luxury of our suite. </s>
<s> masseuse was excellent and she used very high-quality products for my sensitive skin. </s>
<s> was extremely relaxing and I was so pleased to find out that I could get this at the Omni. </s>
<s> was easy for us to see why the Omni came so highly recommended. </s>
<s> also wanted to mention that the staff was very helpful and friendly ; recommending several excellent area restaurants. </s>
<s> ; we think our best meal was at the Omni 's 676 Restaurant ; where my husband raved about the bone-in ribeye and I had the carrot soup and the Lake Erie Silver Bass. </s>
<s> had an extensive wine list and we were easily able to choose wines we loved with the staff 's guidance. </s>
<s> ; the hotel staff also highly recommended we visit the nearby Art Institute of Chicago ; which was a highlight of our trip. </s>
<s> loved that there were multiple museums so close to the Omni ! We will be frequent visitors at the Omni in the future ; where I will definitely be getting the in-room massage again. </s>
<s> are going to pass this recommendation on to all of our friends and family - choose the Omni for a great Chicago experience ! This is the best hotel to stay in when visiting Chicago. </s>
<s> travel a lot ; both for business and vacation. </s>
<s> Talbott Hotel is a cozy yet stately hotel that is handsome ; and elegant. </s>
<s> to mention all the modern features that I 'm used to having at home ; are available in the room. </s>
<s> brought my wife on my last business trip and we stayed in the one bedroom suite. </s>
<s> did n't even want to leave the room. </s>
<s> concierge was especially helpful in finding us a romantic place to go for dinner. </s>
<s> Hilton in Chicago was awesome. </s>
<s> room was very clean and the hotel staff was very professional. </s>
<s> of the features I liked ; was that in my room the internet access was wire and wireless ; considering my laptop is not wireless ; it help me out alot. </s>
<s> was very good ; quality was great. </s>
<s> was also a flat screen in my room . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> awesome. </s>
<s> hotel itself is locaated in the middle of alot of resturants with fin dinning. </s>
<s> also enjoyed the gym very much. </s>
<s> ; I enjoyed myself ; and I will stay again at the Hilton when I return to Chicago. </s>
<s> stayed here last August and I 'm truly glad that I will never have to stay here again. </s>
<s> website does a great job of creating an illusion. </s>
<s> rooms are so much smaller than it seems on the website. </s>
<s> thought the Monaco was walking distance to a few nightclubs but it isnt. </s>
<s> wireless internet is free but it is extremely slow. </s>
<s> such a " classy " hotel ; there isnt a pool. </s>
<s> $ 46 per night ; the on-site parking is way too expensive for guests. </s>
<s> and all ; I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. </s>
<s> Amalfi Hotel in Chicago advertises itself as family friendly ; yet when I arrived with my children it was anything BUT family friendly. </s>
<s> staff seemed miffed and stuck up ; and I had to wait for the personal check in. </s>
<s> was too worried that my kids would ruin the obviously really expensive furniture while I waited ; and other guests ' all single or couples without children seemed annoyed every time I passed with my kids while I was trying to keep them entertained before we checked in. </s>
<s> might not be the best place to stay if you have a kid or two ; even though it is advertised as such. </s>
<s> give you a great big Thumbs Down for false advertising ; Amalfi. </s>
<s> has been one of the most pleasurable hotels Ive ever stayed at. </s>
<s> the beautiful concourse to the amazing food ; Amalfi really exceeds its standards. </s>
<s> in-room spa service was so relaxing and the tang of the wine was incredible. </s>
<s> highly recommend this hotel as I will give my stay a 5 '5 stars. </s>
<s> suites Chicago : It is situated in a very good location being at the heart of the city. </s>
<s> staff of the hotel are quiet friendly and the rooms are good to. </s>
<s> rooms were spacious and even the spacious balcony provided a place to just relax and wind up in the evening with a good view of the city. </s>
<s> was also happy with the parking space available. </s>
<s> rooms were clean and well equipped however the decor needs updating. </s>
<s> Wi-Fi was intermittent which was a bit disappointing but the problem was fixed later. </s>
<s> laundry was done the same day which added a nice touch to the overall feeling. </s>
<s> it was a pleasant experience. </s>
<s> hotel was very poor with customer service. </s>
<s> were so worried about keeping everything up to date and perfect looking in the hotel they rarely worried about their customers ; and their guests. </s>
<s> had to ask for my room to be serviced for cleaning ; and it took a long time to get a response. </s>
<s> disappointed. </s>
<s> few weeks ago we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel was a bust from the get go. </s>
<s> we arrived in the lobby ; we had to wait several minutes for the front desk clerk to show up. </s>
<s> We could hear her talking in the back for 5 minutes. </s>
<s> '
When she got to the desk she was very short with us and not very helpful. </s>
<s> had to wander around the halls looking for our room. </s>
<s> we got to our room ; we thought the weekend was going to get better. </s>
<s> rooms are modern and nicely designed. </s>
<s> was about all that this hotel had going for it though. </s>
<s> soon as we started to explore the room more ; it was clear this room had been a haven for a party a few nights before. </s>
<s> bathroom smelled of vomit and the bath tub had small shards or glass from broken bottles in it. </s>
<s> called a worker and they cleaned most of it up ; but the thought of it still remained. </s>
<s> we all settled down to sleep ; there were a few loud noises coming from the room next door. </s>
<s> about an hour ; we finally made a call to the front desk to complain. </s>
<s> woman said that a rock band was in that room and they had just finished a show in Chicago. </s>
<s> were staying there the next 2 nights. </s>
<s> would n't recommend this hotel to anyone ! It 's a hard rock hotel all right. </s>
<s> At least that 's what the beds feel like ! Affinia hotel in Chicago was one of the most interesting hotels I have ever stayed in. </s>
<s> looks very nice and fancy ; though the people that work there must be from the projects of Chicago. </s>
<s> customer service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life ! When we went to check in ; first we had to wait about 15 minutes for the 3 workers that were at the desk to stop their personal conversation and check us in. </s>
<s> the women at the counter finally acknowledged us ; she was smacking her gum ; and was upset and treating us like we were inconveniencing her ! The room service brought us cold eggs for breakfast ; and the attitude of the staff overall was extremely rude. </s>
<s> would NEVER go back ; and I hope this place gets a staff makeover if they want to stay in business. </s>
<s> Hotel Allegoro Chicago - The bedroom decor was a bit over the top for me but the beds were very comfortable and we had an excellent view. </s>
<s> bathroom was very clean which was a plus and it was nice to be able to bring along our dog. </s>
<s> would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially those traveling with pets. </s>
<s> Monaco is simply amazing. </s>
<s> travel quite a bit ; and am use to generic hotels ; with horribly unimpressive rooms ; and " 5 star amenities " which usually mean a packet of instant coffee ; and room service that wo n't serve after 9pm. </s>
<s> Monaco on the other hand was very impressive. </s>
<s> suite i stayed in was stylish and cozy. </s>
<s> hotel has such personality. </s>
<s> absolute favorite part of my stay ; aside from the amazing meal i had down stairs ; was the in-room spa treatment. </s>
<s> Monaco just raised the bar on hotels for me. </s>
<s> just wo n't do anymore. </s>
<s> you 're looking for luxuary ; look no more. </s>
<s> Conrad is the best. </s>
<s> was in Chicago on business ; and had to stay much longer than anticipated. </s>
<s> coworker suggested this hotel and boy am I glad he did. </s>
<s> location is perfect ; you 're close to everything. </s>
<s> best part is the Conrad is a smoke free hotel. </s>
<s> 'll be back soon. </s>
<s> Satisfied What I hoped would be a pleasant stay turned into a nightmare. </s>
<s> first sign of trouble at the Affinia was that they could n't find my reservation. </s>
<s> to that the room service delivered cold food after a long wait and the mini bar was not well stocked. </s>
<s> internet service was so slow it was unusable. </s>
<s> top it off the street noise seemed to penetrate the thin walls with ease making getting a good night sleep nearly impossible. </s>
<s> ; I discovered the valet parking ; which was a $ 49 premium service ; dented my fender and scratched the door paint on my car. </s>
<s> highly recommend going elsewhere when you visit Chicago. </s>
<s> husband and I stayed at the Omni after attending a wedding that took place there. </s>
<s> were delighted at the luxury of the rooms and the accomodations were wonderful. </s>
<s> from the concierge to the housekeepers were friendly and professional. </s>
<s> were extremely pleased with the whole experience and look forward to our next trip to Chicago so we can stay there again. </s>
<s> ; by the way ; the wedding was absolutely gorgeous ! Hard Rock Hotel - We stayed here in March ; and this place really blew me away. </s>
<s> 's only a few blocks away from a train station and a subway stop ; so we did n't have to walk far in the 20 degree weather '85 Yikes. </s>
<s> was on an upper floor ; so noise was n't a problem and the view at night was spectacular ; but my friend said hers was a little noisier. </s>
<s> guess just ask when you make the reservation. </s>
<s> bathroom was a little cramped ; but the room itself was sizable. </s>
<s> were going to go to the lobby bar for drinks before heading out for the night ; but they did n't have very many tables for bigger groups. </s>
<s> ended up going to Chuck 's Manufacturing instead ; which had some really fun cocktails and was surprisingly big for a hotel restaurant. </s>

Ca n't remember the name now ; but just ask her ; it was awesome ! Do n't let the website fool you. </s>
<s> stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago on my last business trip ; and this was probably one of the worst 4 star hotel I 've ever stayed at. </s>
<s> website makes the place look like a 4 star hotel but it 's more on par with a 2 stars or 3 ; if you want to be generous. </s>
<s> off ; the rooms are not as nice or clean as they look in the picture. </s>
<s> room that I checked into was dingy with paint peeling from the walls ; and the carpet looked like it had n't been vacuumed since god knows when. </s>
<s> I was only staying one night ; I decided not to ask for a different room- although I do n't know if asking for a different room would 've made any difference considering the lack of hospitality from the reception desk. </s>
<s> I arrived ; there were two receptionists chatting it up- no acknowledgement ; no prompt service. </s>
<s> had to wait about 3 minutes although I was the only one in line before any of them acknowledged me. </s>
<s> no ; they were n't talking about hotel matters. </s>
<s> 'm not a difficult or an especially picky person ; and who does n't chat during work with their co-workers but for them to completely ignore and make a client wait for 3 minutes shows serious lack of professionalism. </s>
<s> yourself a favor ; and go stay at the Marriott if you want service- unless the price is tempting but you get what you pay for. </s>
<s> hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere. </s>
<s> smells because pets are allowed. </s>
<s> hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed. </s>
<s> was mold in our room and bathroom ; pet hair everywhere ! Kids love pools. </s>
<s> can they claim to be kid friendly without one ? My kid was bored. </s>
<s> food was basically the same every day ; no variation in the menu. </s>
<s> on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their " travel club " because our room did n't even remotely resemble the pictures. </s>
<s> did the old bait and switch. </s>
<s> reserved a " family room " . </s>
<s> we opened the door of our room ; we realized that it was n't what the website pictured or had what the website described. </s>
<s> kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers. </s>
<s> do not recommend this hotel ! I was not at all impressed with my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago. </s>
<s> in there were two people ahead of me but apparently that takes the 1 ' one ! front desk agent 30 minutes to process. </s>
<s> guests had issues with their rooms regarding ; it seemed ; wrong room types and being out of the room type requested. </s>
<s> was nervous about my own reservation and ; sure enough ; my Superior Corner room was n't available. </s>
<s> hotel tried to compensate me with complimentary breakfast and drinks at the bar but it is still annoying to reserve a room type and not have it be available. </s>
<s> was also annoyed that every little thing has an upcharge at the hotel. </s>
<s> internet ? Upcharge. </s>
<s> extra pillows ? Upcharge. </s>
<s> coffee for the room ? Upcharge. </s>
<s> enough to get that treatment on the airline ride over but to have a hotel nickle and dime you is very annoying and aggravating. </s>
<s> wo n't be back and would strongly recommend other travelers to beware before booking. </s>
<s> 've stayed at other hotels in Chicago ; but this was the first absolutely horrifying experience. </s>
<s> off the staff was incredibly rude. </s>
<s> could have lived with that being that it was busy ; but when the person would not get off their cell phone while a was checking in it had me wanting to pull my hair out. </s>
<s> room was also horrid. </s>
<s> smelled like sex and cigar smoke so bad in there that I was convinced a politician had just checked out after using it for a cheap affair. </s>
<s> was also what looked to be dried snot on the shower curtain. </s>
<s> my words : Never again will I stay at this dump ! Fairmont Chicago Millenium Park - This hotel might be the last hotel I might turn to in Chicago. </s>
<s> could say that the room was not bad ; but I could n't help bouncing around like a ping pong ball inside the room. </s>
<s> course this would have been fun for kids like 3 generations under me ; but obviously I 'm not one of them. </s>
<s> a bed that just takes up space in the middle of the room made the whole experience stuffed. </s>
<s> stayed at the Affina Chicago for my anniversary. </s>
<s> hotel is in a great location ; but that does n't make up for the poor customer service and rudeness of the staff. </s>
<s> looked like the cleaning crew forgot to vacuum from the last guest since there was hair on the carpet. </s>
<s> spent more money than I would normally ; hoping for a luxury experience ; and left very unsatisfied. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel is perfecty located in the center of downtown Chicago. </s>

<s> Skinner I stayed at Swissotel Chicago for 1 night while on vacation with my girlfriend. </s>
<s> plan was to stay 3 nights there originally but its beauty could not make up for the poor service we received from the front desk associate. </s>
<s> walked in and despite being the only guests waiting to check in ; we still stood waiting for 10 minutes while the person at the desk chatted on the phone with someone who was clearly not related to the hotel. </s>
<s> me leaning against the counter finally got her attention ; she got off the phone and acted like I was the one at fault. </s>
<s> to say I will not be staying here again. </s>
<s> I thought was going to be a romantic Chicago Weekend turn out to be lackluster. </s>
<s> Swissotel Chicago per their website seem to tout itself as a luxury destination well much to my surprise it was not. </s>
<s> my reservation was messed up instead of getting " the classic room with a view " we were put in what I guess is their classic king. </s>
<s> view was nothing to write home about. </s>
<s> I called the front desk to complain about the situation I was told their was nothing they could do since the hotel was booked solid. </s>
<s> asked how could this happen when I got a confirmation ? The clerk simply said " probably a glitch sorry is there anything else I can help you with ? " At the point I hung up the phone as I knew our romantic weekend with a view was not going to happen. </s>
<s> we checked out I told a manager what happened and He said there was nothing we can do sorry " I expected a little more customer service from them since they think of themselves as a luxury destination. </s>
<s> Chicage Hotel - A friend and I stayed at the hotel over a weekend. </s>
<s> experience was really disappointing. </s>
<s> paid $ 250 a night while staying here ; only to realize we were being charged $ 300 when checking out ; as they did not mention the additional parking charges right at the start. </s>
<s> staff was not helpful in the least ; saying that it was mentioned earlier. </s>
<s> room was quite spacious ; though was n't well kept. </s>
<s> bed linens for one were not very clean. </s>
<s> add to that ; the bathroom lights were not working ; and required to be changed while we were staying there. </s>
<s> it 's located near Northwestern Memorial hospital ; and the ambulance sirens you hear at night are a nuisance. </s>
<s> thought the stay at the hotel was not worth it ; as we had a really bad experience. </s>

<s> ; a paper band across the toilet ; paper caps on the drinking glasses ; etc. </s>
<s> ; it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place. </s>
<s> was a spot ' probably urine ! on the toilet seat and ; I kid you not ; the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass. </s>
<s> know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things " appear " clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary. </s>
<s> ; the Hilton was proof. </s>
<s> called downstairs and complained ; and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. </s>
<s> ; I found the room disgusting. </s>
<s> hotel itself ; outside the rooms ; was cavernous and unwelcoming ; with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din. </s>
<s> have I been so eager to leave a place as this. </s>
<s> I got home ; I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not ; such was the skeeviness of our accomodations. </s>
<s> ; do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel. </s>
<s> Ambassador East Hotel is a pretty girl with a bad heart. </s>
<s> i was staying for a few nights I notied may problems with the service of this expensive ; cold hotel. </s>

<s> chefs cooking was terriable ; the steak that I spent 35 dollars on was suppost to be rare ; but came to me burnt. </s>

<s> hotel is simply beautiful. </s>
<s> the time we walked through the front doors until the day we left ; we were treated as if we were royalty. </s>
<s> have never been treated so well. </s>
<s> were greeted by staff that sincerely seemed to love their jobs. </s>
<s> stayed in a Superior Corner Suite. </s>
<s> view of the city was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. </s>
<s> rooms were very spacious and clean. </s>
<s> king size bed was extremely comfortable. </s>
<s> room did n't seem like we were in a hotel ; it had the feeling of home. </s>
<s> was a separate living room area which was wonderful ; my husband and I just sat there one night and stared out the window at the skyline. </s>
<s> was mesmerizing. </s>
<s> ordered room service because we had a long day of shopping ; which the hotel is very convenient to a lot of great shopping. </s>
<s> everything is in walking distance. </s>
<s> food was to die for ; it was as if we were eating at a 5 star fine dining restaurant. </s>
<s> did manage to go down and have a few drinks in the lounge. </s>
<s> lounge had a classy feel to it ; very relaxing yet sophisticated. </s>
<s> even received a massage ; in our room. </s>
<s> we did have all the conveniences of home ; such as internet and TV ; we did not even think about using them ; being that we just wanted to get away from our everyday lives. </s>
<s> was the most romantic vacation my husband and I have ever taken. </s>
<s> can not express how happy we were to have stayed in this hotel. </s>
<s> had other options but I am so glad we decided to stay here. </s>
<s> rate for the room was so inexpensive for the amount of luxury we were able to experience ; which the experience itself is priceless. </s>
<s> will definitely share my experience with anyone and everyone and recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> of all when you check in the check in process is smooth and takes no time at all ; the front desk is very friendly and kind and make sure you know where your room is. </s>
<s> on the way to your room they have spots with chairs and a table to have a seat and visit with other guest if you prefer to be out of you room. </s>
<s> room it 's self is very spacious and clean. </s>
<s> pool area is very clean and neat and you always have a towel ; they never seemed to run out. </s>
<s> service is beyond exceptional. </s>
<s> would recommend staying at Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown to anyone. </s>
<s> stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding. </s>
<s> service was impeccable. </s>
<s> only was the staff attentive ; they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner. </s>
<s> had the chicken wellington and it was to die for ! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy. </s>
<s> even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests. </s>
<s> amenities were great ; and after an open bar the night before ; the Mimosas and brunch buffet could n't have been better ! I would love to have my wedding there. </s>
<s> - My husband and I were visiting Chicago for our third anniversary. </s>
<s> read a lot of the reviews beforehand and thought this would be a great place. </s>
<s> it did n't quite live up to the expectations. </s>
<s> room was n't ready when we got there ; so we had to wait an extra 30 minutes. </s>
<s> bed was very uncomfortable ; and the bathroom was unkept. </s>
<s> only thing worse that the room was the food they served at the restaurant. </s>
<s> had the seabass which gave my husband food poisoning for half of the trip. </s>
<s> Talbott Hotel is a place to stay where the staff treat you like you are not welcome. </s>
<s> you do not pay higher prices you are snubbed and the rooms are no classier or fancier than a standard motel. </s>
<s> room service takes over an hour and there is constant traffic and construction outside. </s>
<s> cost is far more than the luxury. </s>
<s> best thing about staying at this hotel are the bathroom towels. </s>
<s> family and I stayed here while we were visiting Chicago. </s>
<s> was a perfect location to many of the things we wanted to do and was easy to get around. </s>
<s> was in a safe neighborhood and was great accomodations. </s>
<s> staff was friendly and went the " extra mile " to make sure we had everything we needed. </s>
<s> beds were comfortable. </s>
<s> would definitely stay here again. </s>
<s> have visited Chicago with my family several times and have never had such a HORRIBLE hotel experience ! The staff was rude and unhelpful ; and they overcharged my card by more than $ 300 ! I had to spend the whole morning on the phone trying to get them to finally fix their mistake. </s>
<s> hotel itself did n't live up to our expectations either . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the inside was dingy and needed cleaning ; and our room looked like a bunch of chain smokers had just thrown a crazy party in the room. </s>
<s> were cigarette burns on the sheets ; stains on the floor ; and there was a hole in the wall where it looked like someone had punched it ! We requested another room ; which was only marginally better in terms of cleanliness ; only to be kept up all night from the noise of our neighbors yelling and hanging out in the hallway. </s>
<s> are plenty of other places to stay in Chicago. </s>
<s> Hard Rock at all costs ! talbotthotel - First trip to Chicago ; found the Talbott online. </s>
<s> location ; easy access to public transportation as well as a short walk to Washington Square Park. </s>
<s> were large and well-decorated ; with tall windows and granite countertops in the bathrooms. </s>
<s> hotel restaurant was n't cheap but the food was surprisingly good ; and our waitress was very nice. </s>
<s> ; I 'd recommend the Talbott. </s>
<s> Allegro I can not say enough about how terrible my experience was at this hotel. </s>
<s> arriving ; I waited a long time for the lobby receptionist to give me the key to my room. </s>
<s> I finally arrived at my room ; it was obvious to me that the room had not been cleaned properly. </s>
<s> food downstairs was nothing to rave about either. </s>
<s> main course came out cold ; and the waiter was pretty rude. </s>
<s> will definitely NOT be coming back to Hotel Allegro. </s>
<s> time I stayed in this city ; I went to the Holiday Inn which was much better ! The hard rock hotel Chicago is not as good as they try to portray ; First ill start off by saying there website is confusing and hard to navigate through. </s>
<s> also have rude customer service ; that dont seem happy to answer your questions. </s>
<s> prices are so outrageously expensive for what they offer ; its just ridiculous. </s>
<s> rock hotel has a good rep behind there name ; but Hard rock hotel Chicago should not be included in that. </s>
<s> Knickerbocker hotel was one of my favorite hotels to visit. </s>
<s> wife and I utilized the park play package ; which gave us an amazing room ; complimentary valet service ; and a great kit to plan our weekend around. </s>
<s> was well worth the price and we both wish to go back again. </s>
<s> rooms were top notch and the hotel 's staff was excellent. </s>
<s> of the employees ; Craig ; helped us find our way around the city and this shows the Knickerbocker really cares about its guests. </s>
<s> loved our visit and are sure you will too. </s>
<s> I stayed with my husband at the Homewood Suites in Chicago. </s>
<s> wanted to do something nice for our anniversary and thought that the Hilton was a solid name brand and expected to have a pleasant stay. </s>
<s> this was not the case ! The staff was very rude at check-in ' which took 20 minutes and the lobby smelled musky and gross. </s>
<s> room itself was not like other Hilton hotels I have stayed at. </s>
<s> carpeting was atrocious and the color of vomit ; the room smelled of smoke ' even though it 's advertised as smoke-free and there were a few long brown hairs in our bed ! I was so grossed out that I had to call down to the rude staff to ask for our linens to be changed and they gave us a huge attitude about it. </s>
<s> do n't even get me started on how poorly the shower 'bathtub worked . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> a nice anniversary went totally awry due to how crummy this hotel is. </s>
<s> I could give it 0 stars ; I would ! My wife and I booked a Deluxe Accessible Room at this beautiful hotel for three nights. </s>
<s> wonderful photos do n't do the hotel justice. </s>
<s> could n't have been a more ideal stay. </s>
<s> room was spacious and and clean ; the bathroom sparkling ; with every amenity one could imagine. </s>
<s> bed felt like it had been just delivered. </s>
<s> views of downtown Chicago were spectacular. </s>
<s> top of all of this ; the hotel staff was extremely helpful. </s>
<s> explained the best routes to the restaurants we wanted to eat at ; and they even went as far as securing us reservations for the places they knew would be busy ! Believe everything good that you read. </s>
<s> you visit Chicago ; stay at the Conrad Chicago. </s>
<s> stay at the Hyatt Regency was an experience that I 'll never ever forget - not in a good way. </s>
<s> was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant. </s>
<s> went up to my room and looked around ; all seemed ok at first. </s>
<s> was bushed so I flopped on the bed . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  ohhhhh noooooo ! The bed was as hard as a military bunk from my Army days. </s>
<s> I was so tired that I just passed out. </s>
<s> course I woke up with a back ache . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> great. </s>
<s> figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so I plugged the tub ; turned the hot water on full force ; and poured in some shower gel. </s>
<s> put my foot in expecting some real heat - the water was barely lukewarm. </s>
<s> called the front desk but they were no help ; the clerk just apologized. </s>
<s> at this point ; I turned on the tv and switched on the air. </s>
<s> put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and I saw something slimy inside of the vent. </s>
<s> looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something. </s>
<s> could n't take anymore of this. </s>
<s> went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk. </s>
<s> seemed as though the guy was on something - he kept smiling as he apologized ; no empathy as if he 's used to hearing about the goop in the ac. </s>
<s> offered me a free night but there is no way that I 'd stay at this place again - ever. </s>
<s> Conrad Chicago is a Michelin rated hotel ; so I was expecting great service and wonderful accommodations. </s>
<s> ; only one part of that was correct. </s>
<s> rooms are indeed nicely furnished ; but the service was terrible ! The concierge was unable to find my room reservation ' I reserved online and even had the email confirmation and was n't very helpful in getting me a new room. </s>
<s> ordered room service ; and the wait time was so long that the food came up cold. </s>
<s> mean ; I understand that it would take time to get the food prepared and up to my room ; but really ? For the price I paid ; it was definitely not worth it ; and I would never use this hotel again. </s>
<s> wife and I decided to stay at the Amalfi while we visited friends in Chicago ; we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this ' Luxury hotel to any of our friends. </s>
<s> claims that your stay begins with a ' warm greeting ; but we received the exact opposite. </s>
<s> front desk clerk was rude ; sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question ; and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room. </s>
<s> there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog ; who we had to bring at the last minute. </s>
<s> room on the Pet Floor was alright ; nothing spectacular ; and unfortunately had a slight scent of covered-up dog urine. </s>
<s> proceeded to dinner at Keefer 's Restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time. </s>
<s> have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire ; opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant. </s>
<s> next day ; I could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly ; and had to finish some work at our friend 's house. </s>
<s> wife had called for some extra towels and pillows ; which took about half an hour to receive. </s>
<s> also ordered breakfast because Breakfast in Bed WAS her favorite- until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them. </s>
<s> were set to stay for 3 days ; but only managed to stay 2. </s>
<s> will not be staying here again. </s>
<s> Downtown Chicago Hilton was the best combination of all the things we were looking for in a hotel- perfect location for both those of us who like shopping and those of us who prefer tourist attractions. </s>
<s> with a Hilton means the essentials are never a concern- as always ; the room was clean and impeccably neat ; the staff friendly and very capable. </s>
<s> wireless access and big flat screen TV were an added plus too ! Best of all ; it is a pet-friendly hotel ; something that is unusual in bigger city 4-diamond hotels. </s>
<s> ; Chicago Hilton ; for a great stay ! Intercontinential Chicago Hotel - This hotel is amazing. </s>
<s> usually have pretty high standards for hotels ; but this hotel has exceeded even my expectations. </s>
<s> is right in downtown Chicago and close to several really well known restaurants. </s>
<s> rooms are gorgeous ; the bathroom is so spacious and the room was laid out such that it felt very spacious. </s>
<s> view from the window was amazing and the management was top notch. </s>
<s> was n't sure what to expect when I read the reviews but I took a chance and booked a room ; I 'm really glad I did ! We really enjoyed our stay ! It is a beautiful hotel and the entire staff is helpful and polite. </s>
<s> had great suggestions on where to eat ; what to do ; etc. </s>
<s> were within walking distance of many great Chicago locations like the Navy Pier and Art Institute. </s>
<s> rooms were clean and the beds comfortable ; I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great home away from home in Chicago. </s>
<s> have no idea why this is considered a four star hotel. </s>
<s> Omni Chicago 's age shows ; and not in a " great ambiance " way ! The rooms are dingy and just plain worn looking. </s>
<s> say rooms because we had to switch our original room as there was a terrible musty odor ; almost like mildew ; that permeated the first room we were given. </s>
<s> ; it brought tears to my eyes ! The staff seemed rather indifferent to our dilemma ; but finally agreed to switch us to another room. </s>
<s> new one did n't smell ; but was clearly past its prime. </s>
<s> was almost nonexistent. </s>
<s> had to call them back both days of our trip to empty the trash and for towels. </s>
<s> can you forget to leave towels for the guests ? I 'm not one to complain ; but for the kind of money we spent for a weekend here ; we were expecting at least a little luxury and special treatment. </s>
<s> received neither and will not be returning to the Omni Chicago. </s>
<s> stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel was wonderful ! I had a last minute business trip ; in downtown Chicago ; and this is the first place I looked at. </s>
<s> looked at the pictures they show online of the rooms ; and the facility itself ; and I simply fell in love with the place. </s>
<s> indoor pool ; outdoor sun decks ; massages ; this place really has all you could possibly need ; whether you 're on vacation ; or needing a little stress relieved from a busy week. </s>
<s> mean they even have high speed wireless internet ! I would definitely recommend the Omni Chicago Hotel ; if you want a great place to stay near Downtown Chicago ! To whom this may concern ; my name is Jamie Brown ; and i was a recent guest of yours between July 4th through July 10th ; and your staff made my stay so comfortable i almost didnt want to leave. </s>
<s> Kitchen in the room and the complimentary grocery shopping service made me rethink leaving all together and when i didnt feel like cooking the complimentary welcome home dinner with a glass of wine ; helped me clear my mind for all the paper work i had to look forward to. </s>
<s> free wireless internet access both in my room and sitting by the pool helped get all that done and helped me get my laps in as well. </s>
<s> really could n't have asked for anything more ! I felt like a queen and I never though I could feel that way just staying in a hotel. </s>
<s> thank you so very much for treating me so kindly and I will gladly be visiting you again very soon ; only for more pleasure and way less business. </s>
<s> yours ; Jamie Brown A few nights ago ; I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in the Theater District of Chicago. </s>
<s> 'd heard some amazing things about the great food ; and how friendly the staff were. </s>
<s> arrival ; the service at the front desk and the bellman was fantastic ! They treated me as if I stayed there all the time ! The rooms were cozy ; with very comfortable beds that helped me sleep through my jet lag. </s>
<s> ordered breakfast the next morning ; and had room service bring it up. </s>
<s> meal was brought up only a few minutes after ordering ; and was delicious ! I would recommend these accommodations for anyone traveling ; or any families staying in Chicago ; as the rooms were very reasonably priced ; and is a short distance to lots of great sites. </s>
<s> time I come through Chicago ; I will definitely be staying here ! Chicago Hotels : The Sheraton Chicago Hotel Towers - First ; the Sheraton Chicago is definitely in a fantastic location. </s>
<s> 's right next to the river and only a few blocks from the lake. </s>
<s> the other direction its right next to Michigan Avenue so we could walk to almost everything we wanted to see. </s>
<s> hotel 's accommodations were also great. </s>
<s> bathroom and bed are quite comfortable and also clean. </s>
<s> the downside the internet was not free and the fridge automatically charges you when moving items so I was not able to put my drinks inside but I would still highly recommend this hotel. </s>
<s> and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital. </s>
<s> ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here. </s>
<s> first once coming into the room ; there was a mildewy smell in the air ; which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase. </s>
<s> continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well. </s>
<s> eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all. </s>
<s> make matters even worse ; the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon ; when my wife was back from exploring the city. </s>
<s> was simply unacceptable by any standard. </s>

<s> bed was heavenly. </s>
<s> hotel staff was friendly ; upbeat and extremely helpful ; we asked for directions and restaurant recommendations and they were spot on with both. </s>
<s> highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. </s>
<s> Chicago - The room itself was n't anything too special ; but the view of the lake was great. </s>
<s> noise could be heard from the neighbors but it did n't prove to be too much problem. </s>
<s> made the Hilton Chicago hotel great are the exceptional dining options they offer and the various activities you can do here ranging from swimming to fitness and visiting the aquarium or museum. </s>

<s> - The Amalfi Hotel is a wonderful ; decently priced ; experience. </s>
<s> rooms are large ; pleasent and comfortable. </s>
<s> hotel provides free wifi and DVDs ; which is a plus ; but the movie selection is rather lacking ; mostly comprised of children 's films. </s>
<s> was simply the best food I 've had in a long time. </s>
<s> recommended ! The Palmer House Hilton ; while it looks good in pictures ; and the outside ; is actually a disaster of a hotel. </s>
<s> I went through ; the lobby was dirty ; my room had n't been cleaned ; and smelled thoroughly of smoke. </s>
<s> I requested more pillows ; the lady on the phone scoffed at me and said she 'd send them up. </s>
<s> took over an hour for 2 pillows. </s>
<s> hotel is a good example that what you pay for is n't always what you get. </s>
<s> will not be returning. </s>
<s> Omni Chicago Hotel is not pretty as they advertise it. </s>
<s> of all ; it really difficult to get there because its located in down town Chicago and they fail to mention that the traffic is a nightmare. </s>
<s> you finally make to the hotel you have to wait like 30 minutes for the front desk to take care of you. </s>
<s> I arrived there was one person at the desk and a few people checking in ; and I thought the wait time was ridiculous. </s>
<s> make matters worse ; I need internet connection and the day I was there they had technical problems and the Internet was not working in my room. </s>
<s> hours later they managed it get to work ; the connection was still very slow. </s>
<s> my part ; the hotel might look nice but services is did not meet my expectations. </s>

<s> Customer Service Person was rude and did not wait on me for a few minutes. </s>
<s> I got up to the room it looked like someone had just checked out. </s>
<s> High Chair that we requested still had spots of food on it. </s>
<s> Rest Room had water on the counter and very little toilet paper. </s>
<s> we got settled we went down to the dining room for supper and was disappointed in the service and the food quality for the price we paid. </s>
<s> we only had to stay there one day. </s>
<s> day was almost too long. </s>
<s> James Hotel in Chicago is by far one of the best hotels that My family and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. </s>
<s> room service is the best in the area ; not to mention the spa in the hotel is to die for. </s>
<s> lobby and the reception area is very contemporary. </s>
<s> is a great place to take the family to relax. </s>
<s> would recommend this hotel to anyone. </s>
<s> stars ! I just got home from my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel. </s>
<s> and my family were in Chacago for the the week and this hotel was the closest to where we needed to be. </s>
<s> we walked in the door there was a horrid odor. </s>
<s> like a public bathroom. </s>
<s> check in clerk was very irritable and was very uncooperative. </s>
<s> would not let us go to our rooms because our entire family was not there yet ! When we finally got to our rooms the beds were not made and the room was uninviting. </s>

<s> stayed at the Hilton Chicago back in July. </s>
<s> a " luxury " hotel this place did not meet my expectations. </s>
