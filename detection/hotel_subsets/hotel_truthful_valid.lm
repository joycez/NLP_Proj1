<s> Overview : -- Overrated hotel in a premium location. </s>
<s> Great : -- Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants ; bars ; and sights. </s>
<s> Good : -- Inviting lobby ; pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby ; in particular the night deskman. </s>
<s> bathroom ; comfortable bed and desk chair. </s>
<s> Mediocre : -- Room ' excluding bathroom was underwhelming in design. </s>
<s> kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray 's across the street. </s>
<s> cocktails 5-7pm in " lounge " is right idea with wrong execution ; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. </s>
<s> water ' or lack thereof - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. </s>
<s> is pretty low. </s>
<s> - mine was n't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. </s>
<s> Bad : -- Free wi-fi ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day ; even when my computer was n't moved - really aggravating. </s>
<s> deal for my iPhone. </s>
<s> also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. </s>
<s> blackout curtains ! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning ' not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night. </s>
<s> had this issue in any hotel or motel I 've ever stayed at. </s>
<s> ! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling ; bar music ; trucks ; car horns ; and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. </s>
<s> had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. </s>
<s> had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel. </s>
<s> the remote was useless. </s>
<s> room bar had standard inflated prices but the $ 7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting. </s>
<s> n't even think of opening it ; there 's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. </s>
<s> : -- Not recommended. </s>
<s> much nicer in the website photos than it is. </s>
<s> on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star. </s>

<s> of interesting amenities in the room. </s>
<s> to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping. </s>
<s> loved the lobby -- a great place to hang around or wait for someone. </s>
<s> of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere. </s>
<s> out : The concierge ' like all concierges at big hotels will direct you to mediocre ; large restaurants where they get kickbacks. </s>
<s> have stayed here several times and I always check for rooms here when I travel to Chicago. </s>
<s> ; the hotel is often full so book early. </s>
<s> stayed at the Fairmont during a professional conference. </s>
<s> I have to say that for a conference ; some of the meeting rooms were too small ; in terms of traveler 's comfort the hotel is exceptional ! I ca n't think of a single thing about my room that was n't perfect. </s>
<s> accommodations were luxurious and the hotel is conveniently situated within walking distance of many Chicago attractions. </s>
<s> reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed. </s>
<s> booked through their web site about 2 1 '2 months prior to arrival for $ 170 'night plus tax for a room with 2 queens. </s>
<s> location was perfect - right by the river near Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> - minutes walk to the El ; Millenium Park ; the Theater District and Shopping. </s>
<s> room was clean ; a little larger than standard and nicely decorated. </s>
<s> had window seats in the room with a view of the river. </s>
<s> was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening. </s>
<s> top it off ; the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area. </s>
<s> have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood ; cost and amenities. </s>
<s> hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open ; you would n't know it. </s>
<s> need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock. </s>
<s> beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a " nicer historic hotel. </s>
<s> " 
I will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime. </s>
<s> was a very frustrating experience. </s>
<s> only stayed out with my boyfriend for one night ; however enjoyed my stay. </s>
<s> staff was friendly ; the room was nice and clean ; the hallways and ballrooms etc were elegant. </s>
<s> service was quick and had good options to choose from that actually tasted great. </s>
<s> staff was able to extend our check out time for an extra 1-2 hours without an extra charge to the room. </s>
<s> location too ! Walking distance from the Art Museum ; Millennium Park ; Grant Park ' right across the street and a quick cab ride to McCormick Place. </s>
<s> I were in the city again I would love to stay there again. </s>
<s> Hard Rock is glossy and sexy ; but an absolutely fantastic hotel . </s>

I was in town for business and stayed here because of it 's location ; but I absolutely understand why tourists would like it . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> right on the river ; cool art deco building and Millenium Park is just down the street. </s>
<s> the room was clean ; the staff was friendly ; but NOT annoying and the bar was fun. </s>
<s> was comfortable having a couple of drinks alone at the end of the day - they were GOOD ! I 'll definitely try it again ! I have stayed in hotels all over the world ; and this is probably the worst service that I 've ever experienced. </s>
<s> staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would. </s>
<s> decided to try the Monaco because it seemed interesting ; was close to the theater ; and had what seemed to be a good rate. </s>
<s> a huge mistake. </s>
<s> front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful. </s>
<s> room was not clean ; the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving ; they never bothered to come turn down the beds ; and the late check-out " priviledges " which were guarenteed when I booked the room suddenly became " upon request " - boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful. </s>
<s> waste your time or your money here. </s>
<s> best ; it 's nothing special. </s>
<s> ; I like the Fairmont in Chicago ; but anyplace woudl be better than the Monaco. </s>
<s> ca n't recall another time I 've had to deal with such rude front desk help. </s>
<s> pleasant initially ; as soon as I demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that I was still waiting to claim my luggage for check-in ' I arrived prior to check-in time ; so they were holding a few bags ; the true quality of this establishment surfaced. </s>
<s> mind that the luggage was n't sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 7 : 30pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop. </s>
<s> that was a bit annoying ; the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of Donna ; the very attractive but aloof front desk employee. </s>
<s> lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness ; as I noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay ; including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning. </s>
<s> also booked a rate that included parking ; which Donna acknowledged at check-in but at check out billed me separately ; I assume after I got on her bad side. </s>
<s> with my last polite good bye to the front desk ; I felt a phony ; uppity attitude from Donna ; and I really ca n't convey the extent of how insulting it felt. </s>
<s> can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to Chicago. </s>
<s> hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy. </s>
<s> location as well. </s>
<s> be fair ; most of the staff seemed very friendly ; and I am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier. </s>
<s> I think most travelers ; like me ; would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service ; so as to not have a " situation " that could single-handedly ruin a travel experience. </s>
<s> ; that was the case here. </s>
<s> hotel was wonderful ! I am a college student who went with my mom for the weekend and we both liked it ! Pros : THE FRONT DESK and THE STAFF ! - Helpful : Knew great places to eat and HOW to get there Breakfast : Pastries ; coffee ; tea ; muffins ; etc : Fresh Drinks hors d 'oeuvres : Yummy ! Rooms - Clean - Well decorated Lots of people of different ages stayed there Cons : Very very very far from the museums From checkin to departure a poorly run hotel. </s>
<s> took 30 minutes in line to check in because only one clerk was on duty. </s>
<s> person ; perhaps the manager ; was in the back room but never came out to help the check in clerk even as the line grew. </s>
<s> hotels elevators are small resulting in 10 minute waits to get up and down floors ; especially when 1 of the 3 breaks ; as seems to be frequent occurence. </s>
<s> specifically asking for a room away from the elevators ; I was assigned to a room directly across from them ; necessitating another 20 minute wait in line. </s>
<s> room smelled of mildew and water dripped from the ceiling the first night. </s>
<s> requested a news paper be delivered to my room - it appeared on the morning and never again. </s>
<s> ; the hotel is understaffed and poorly trained. </s>
<s> again ! me ' taking a cue from david dancer : ' sup ? front desk person : yes ? me : so ; do I have to wait in the elevator line to get up to my room ? front desk person : what room are you in ? me : front desk person : oh. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> : oh ? wtf ! so ; we 're staying at this hotel ; and there is a bar on the 29th floor ; but we have to wait 15 minutes in line to get to our fucking hotel room ? get bent ! we 're paying to stay here ; not just drinking in your bar ! The Ambassador East is located in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago. </s>
<s> is just a few blocks from the train station ; so it was easy to get anywhere in town. </s>
<s> hotel is a National Historic Landmark so the lobby is elegant and beautiful. </s>
<s> loved the Pump Room bar with tons of B W photos of celebrities. </s>
<s> service was wonderful and everyone was friendly and helpful. </s>
<s> centrally located in the Loop directly south of the 7th Day Adventist Church ' my room looked down upon Wacker Drive ; the aforementioned church and the Chicago River. </s>
<s> room ; virtually no storage space. </s>
<s> a conference with the Monaco as venue. </s>

<s> bathroom was very nice also. </s>
<s> ; I was very pleased with the stay. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> thought that was a good security issue. </s>
<s> has a great location too ; close to downtown. </s>
<s> would recommend it. </s>
<s> decorations were very classy. </s>
<s> hotels have two of the same framed art ; boring bedspreads and lumpy pillows. </s>
<s> Hyatt Regency was just the opposite. </s>
<s> was a refreshing change from the ordinary. </s>
<s> loved the location ; the service and the amenities offered by this hotel. </s>

<s> enjoyed having breakfast there. </s>
<s> will stay there again. </s>
<s> and over-priced. </s>
<s> fact that they have a complimentary wine reception every night at 5 doesnt take away from the fact that they have terrible beds and the place isnt as clean as it should be for a 4 star hotel. </s>
<s> hallways smelled like a dog parlor and the carpets in my room look like they had n't been cleaned . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> well ; ever. </s>
<s> decorative pillows on my bed were so filthy they were actually stained brown and looked like they had been sitting outside for everyone to use and then put back on my bed. </s>

I recently stayed at this hotel with my family ' 10-1 10-3. </s>
<s> had a terrific experience. </s>
<s> landed the hotel through Priceline for $ 80 per night and paid an additional $ 75 per night for a suite on the 41st floor. </s>

<s> HO HI HO ; off to Chicago we go. </s>
<s> 's the skinny ; if you 're hoping to run into a washed up rock star ' CeCe Deville for us ; and no the teenagers had no idea who he was you may want to spend your hard earned money here. </s>

<s> chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance. </s>
<s> mean come on it is supposed to be " COOL " . </s>
<s> it wasn 't. </s>
<s> Positives : ' It is in the Carbon Carbide Building ; which is beautiful. </s>
<s> The location : it sits in the middle of everything ' The lobby has two computers for guest use. </s>
<s> The fitness center is very nice. </s>
<s> machines have individual TV 's and there are head phones in case you forgot yours. </s>
<s> have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack. </s>
<s> Check-in and out was quick and Valet was very courteous. </s>
<s> Negatives : ' The rooms were small and ours was n't clean ' pistachio shells on the floor. </s>
<s> rooms were painted purplish gray ' we were on the Prince floor with a picture of Bob Marley hanging on one of the walls. </s>
<s> girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows. </s>
<s> Bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub. </s>
<s> The cable reception was poor ; I kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture. </s>
<s> It is n't anywhere near the Hard Rock Cafe. </s>
<s> There was very little memorabilia. </s>
<s> There is no pool ; and yes I knew this when I made the reservation. </s>

<s> were upgraded to club level rooms and stayed in 3114 and 3115 adjoining. </s>
<s> view from both rooms was spectacular ' as you can tell from the picture attached. </s>
<s> also left a plate of cookies and treats in the kids room upon check-in which made us all feel very special. </s>
<s> hotel is central to both Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. </s>
<s> so we walked ; trolleyed ; and cabbed all around the area. </s>
<s> ate the breakfast buffet both mornings and thought it was pretty good. </s>
<s> eggs were a little runny ; but they happily made a different batch for us at the omelet station. </s>
<s> six year old ate free and our two eleven year olds were $ 14 ' instead of the adult $ 20 The rooms were clean ; the concierge reception staff were both friendly and helpful . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> we will definitely visit this Sheraton again when we 're in Chicago next time. </s>
<s> from the location ; great ; but it stops there. </s>
<s> check-in ; I was informed I would have a queen bed. </s>
<s> asked for a king size bed ; and I was told there would be a charge for going up to a king. </s>
<s> ME A BREAK ; a surcharge for going from a queen to a king. </s>
<s> I got up to the room ; it was like a oven. </s>
<s> could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service. </s>
<s> in the room had a charge associated to it ; even down to the coffee ; $ 1. </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> what 's up with that ? I was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom. </s>
<s> small. </s>
<s> have stayed there twice and with so many other options ; I feel this will be my last. </s>
<s> first entering the hotel ; we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful bellmen I have ever encountered. </s>

<s> is served in the AM ; and the servers were as delightful as the bellmen. </s>
<s> was a very enjoyable stay. </s>
<s> stayed in this hotel for 5 days in November together with my colleagues. </s>
<s> only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day. </s>
<s> fridge or microwave included in the price. </s>
<s> room had two too soft full size beds. </s>
<s> the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall. </s>
<s> doesnt believe it ; check out the 16th floor close to room 212. </s>
<s> discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous. </s>
<s> stayed in the Hyatt Regency before for much cheaper and that was way better. </s>
<s> restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty ; but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served. </s>
<s> stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby. </s>
<s> stayed for just one night ; but the hotel staff was extremely friendly and polite. </s>
<s> rooms were clean and large. </s>
<s> decor had just been redone. </s>
<s> best perks were the complimentary continental breakfast on each floor in the morning and the free cocktail hour with premium drinks and great appetizers at night. </s>

<s> called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference - $ 45. </s>
<s> then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I declined. </s>

<s> 
We stayed at Amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more. </s>
<s> 's a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but it 's just not worth the money. </s>
<s> does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast. </s>
<s> sheets though ; made us itch for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things. </s>
<s> breakfast could really benefit from some bagels or yougurt. </s>
<s> ; it 's just an early morning sugar attach of muffins ; danishes ; sweet breads ; and croissants. </s>
<s> are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain variety ; if you are into that sort of thing. </s>
<s> ; the windows do not open and there is a climate control device in the room. </s>
<s> problem with it that it keeps blowing air all the time ; alternating between cold and warm ; right over the bed. </s>
<s> is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale. </s>
<s> do have a business center where you can send fax and use internet for free. </s>
<s> problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there. </s>
<s> person at a time . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 
All and all ; we will not stay there again. </s>
<s> we feel like luxury ; we have to find some other place. </s>
<s> if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city ; maybe we will try Red Roof Inn or something like that. </s>
<s> least we 'll know what we are paying for. </s>
<s> for a week last month. </s>
<s> n't beat the location - close to the Magnificent Mile ; Attractions ; Tours ; Great Restaurants Night Life. </s>
<s> spent a lot of nights in other Homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels. </s>
<s> the room was ok ; not great. </s>
<s> in my opinion. </s>
<s> staff to be uninterested and not very helpful. </s>
<s> to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less. </s>
<s> during the week as other guests were made to wait as well. </s>
<s> was the same stuff day after day. </s>
<s> the week went on ; they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished ' weekly delivery I guess. </s>
<s> ; the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant. </s>
<s> for work ' sales and frequently stay in hotels. </s>
<s> with family every year and also stay in hotels. </s>
<s> is roughing it for me . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> not a camper. </s>
<s> come to Chicago again ; but would not stay here. </s>
<s> are too many other options worth investigating. </s>
<s> have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok. </s>
<s> main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center ; which is truly annoying. </s>
<s> addition ; there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator. </s>
<s> than that ; it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm. </s>
<s> ; the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable. </s>
<s> door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk ; and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed. </s>
<s> was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed ; so they shoved it off to the side. </s>
<s> 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel. </s>
<s> should not be sold as a hotel room. </s>
<s> just enjoyed a 3-day weekend at the Swissotel Chicago. </s>
<s> friend of mine booked it and got a GREAT rate. </s>
<s> than even a fleabag motel. </s>
<s> keep an eye out for specials. </s>
<s> view was great ; the location was prime. </s>
<s> staff was helpful. </s>
<s> room was large ' we had 2 double beds. </s>
<s> only have one complaint. </s>

<s> room is not even spectacular ; very small ; probably a little bigger than a walk-in closet. </s>
<s> here at your own risk. </s>
<s> travelled to Illinois from the UK on business ; and booked Friday and Saturday night at the Homewood Suites so that I could have a weekend in the city. </s>
<s> location was perfect ; walking distance to Michigan Ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff ; and literally 100 yards to the L ' red line for getting out to the surrounding areas. </s>
<s> room was great : not exactly ' wow decor but clean and really well stocked. </s>
<s> was expecting a ' suite to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area. </s>
<s> was actually a 3-room mini-apartment ; with an open lounge 'kitchen ; bedroom ; and bathroom. </s>
<s> flatscreen TVs and a huge bed. </s>

<s> me first start by saying I have always been pleased with the Conrad hotels and that is why I chose the Conrad Chicago. </s>
<s> was very disappointed in the level of service. </s>
<s> phone calls to get maintenance to fix the bathroom sink ; unpleasant experience in the Terrace resturant ; front desk not aware of room eminities ; and a very uncaring MOD ! All the Conrad hotels I have stayed at have been 5 STAR but not this one. </s>
<s> have to give it 2 stars ! : We just returned from a weekend at the Palmer House. </s>

<s> is a very large hotel ; so they have to move a lot of people and rooms. </s>
<s> ; the hotel does not have views as it is configured like an " E " . </s>
<s> in all ; the Palmer House is a good value for the money. </s>
<s> is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of US cities. </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> had a pretty anonymous experience the rest of our stay -- which was fine with us. </s>

<s> also highly recommend the Urban Cruise on the river ' the entrance is right across from the hotel -- we saw some amazing architecture from the boat and got to cruise Lake Michigan a bit too. </s>
<s> n't park your car here if you do n't need to -- it 's very expensive. </s>
<s> downtown or ditch the rental car -- you wo n't need it anyway ; you can walk to tons of stuff or grab a cab. </s>

<s> via hotwire ; upgraded to historic tower. </s>

<s> we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity. </s>
<s> were woke up at 3 : 00am in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor. </s>

<s> were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on. </s>
<s> called the front desk who sent security up immediately. </s>
<s> tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave. </s>
<s> called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down. </s>
<s> of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted. </s>
<s> we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate. </s>
<s> we still paid for it !. </s>
<s> would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had. </s>
<s> would never stay at this hotel again ; obviously they really do n't care about their guests. </s>
<s> this hotel the first time I was in Chicago. </s>
<s> the prices and for being classified an intercontinental . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> I would n't consider it that good. </s>

The service was ok. </s>

<s> 've stayed in The Splendido ; Villa D 'Este and others and it does n't compare ; but nor should it. </s>

<s> only a small notch too !. </s>
<s> clean and bright room. </s>

<s> service all round and nice staff. </s>
<s> the money and quality it stacked up very well indeed. </s>

<s> at this hotel with 3 friends or 4 nights. </s>
<s> hotel was clean and tidy ; throughout. </s>

<s> is an excellent location. </s>
<s> was a few minor issues. </s>
<s> hotel is clearly geared toward the convention and business crowd. </s>
<s> were charges for almost everything ; although I did not incur any of these. </s>
<s> room was a little small for the class of hotel ; but not overwhelmingly small. </s>
<s> a true complaint ; but the elevators were very slow. </s>
<s> comparison was that we stayed in an equally aged hotel in a different city during our trip ; and the Intercontinental 's were significantly slower. </s>
<s> 's it ; no more little nit picks. </s>
<s> staff was excellent ; the doormen being the highlight. </s>

<s> our return ; nothing had been moved in the room to re-clean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so I can only assume ; it was n't even checked as promised. </s>
<s> only had 3 towels for the 4 of us and had to call for more. </s>
<s> were promptly delivered but room service took 40 minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice ! The curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming ; the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it ; the honor bar 'fridge was gouged and dirty ; too ! The mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on - not neat and tidy at all . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> There were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well. </s>
<s> disappointing to say the least. </s>
<s> have buyer 's remorse and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds ! We were compensated for our upgrade - $ 20. </s>
<s> but given the price of parking ; taxes ; and etc. </s>
<s> at this point I would n't recommend this Hyatt to anyone. </s>
<s> husband travels and uses his Hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4-star hotel. </s>
<s> felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility. </s>
<s> first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews. </s>
<s> some reason ; I kept being disappointed at every turn. </s>
<s> room on the 4th floor. </s>
<s> not get the room to cool down - it was stifling. </s>
<s> WARNED - No water ; no mini-bar no vending machine ; no nothing once you get in your room. </s>
<s> might as well be in prison. </s>
<s> have coffee in the morning ; but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days. </s>
<s> guess that is convenient for them ; but what about me ? Workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest. </s>
<s> only treadmill I could get on was broken. </s>
<s> what a cooler with water in it ! Oh no - it was only stocked for one day. </s>
<s> that nothing. </s>
<s> to set expectations and then fail to deliver. </s>
<s> with towels - one day they have them - next day they don 't. </s>
<s> essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $ 10 charge for wireless ' go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free. </s>
<s> should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach. </s>
<s> have stayed at much better for less. </s>
<s> n't be coming back. </s>
<s> a tattered run down facility that you should avoid . </s>
<s> are small ; dirty ; and in no way represents the web sites representations. </s>
<s> is poorly trained and a very big disappointment. </s>
<s> best it is a 3 star facility ands with so many options in Chicago ; " please " avoid this one. </s>
<s> had no choice to stay here as a client booked the rooms. </s>
<s> allowed parties to go on all night and booked us in a room with no running water. </s>
<s> called security twice for them to do nothing about the party. </s>
<s> they finally came up about 30 people filed out of that room only to file right back in after about 10 minutes. </s>
<s> we called back nothing was done about it. </s>
<s> 2 year old son was awaken by all the loud music and cursing. </s>
<s> we get up the next morning at 7 : 30 to get ready only to find that we have no running water. </s>
<s> the maintenance man piddles around with it for a half hour we have no time to shower and have to ride the two hour train ride dirty and tired from no sleep. </s>
<s> did not resolve this issue. </s>
<s> just keep passing my complaint to " managers " supposedly. </s>
<s> was the worst stay of my life and my poor two year old had to be there for it After reading the Trip Advisor reviews ; I was expecting an exceptional stay. </s>
<s> was not impressed overall. </s>
<s> concierge ; the view ; and the hotel resturant were the highlights. </s>
<s> bed ; although not horrible ; was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home ; and I do not consider myself and extremely fussy person. </s>
<s> was traveling for business ; and although not dressed in formalwear ; was also not dressed down ; but all in all ; it felt a bit pretentious to me. </s>

<s> NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL ! I stayed at the Hilton Chicago last week and was very disappointed. </s>
<s> highlight of the stay was waiting 20 minutes for a bellman to come and get our luggage. </s>
<s> ; my 72 year old mother ; 8 year old son ; and myself gave up and dragged it all down to valet parking ourselves - no easy task. </s>

There are homeless up and down Michigan Street ; but this is different as it 's a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street. </s>
<s> entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work ; and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation. </s>
<s> now ; expect two extremely small ; warm ; slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm ; cramped hallways ! All the walls throughout the hotel need painting ; and the wallpaper is peeling in places. </s>

<s> " pub " downstairs is run down ; dark and kind of creepy. </s>
<s> and room service are very expensive ; as is parking $ 34 'day public and $ 38 'day valet. </s>
<s> the plus side ; the bed was very comfortable ; there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area ; plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans St. </s>
<s> Clair street toward the north and south. </s>

<s> small ; but clean. </s>
<s> in all ; it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room ; but I think it is overpriced ; and I would not stay here again. </s>

<s> in was a breeze ; and our room was ready even though we were several hours early. </s>
<s> staff was friendly and helpful ; excellent breakfast. </s>
<s> overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel. </s>
<s> " amenities " were a smoke screen ; nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn. </s>
<s> would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase. </s>
<s> charged $ 15 'day for Internet on top of a $ 250 'night rate was a bit over the top. </s>

<s> was a gorgeous hotel from the outside and in the lobby. </s>
<s> ; when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy. </s>
<s> bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty. </s>
<s> internet is available ; but that 's an additional fee. </s>
<s> you kidding ? Even the roach motel offers wireless for free ! Also ; the fitness room was available for only $ 15 per day. </s>
<s> ; I thought the room rate was enough to cover that. </s>
<s> I used the coffee supplies in the room ; they were not replenished. </s>
<s> called the next morning requesting more and was told that was n't housekeeping 's area but they would send some up. </s>
<s> kidding ; nearly 90 minutes later I got the cream and sugar ! Glad I was n't in a big hurry. </s>

<s> : Elegant lobby nicely decorated with fresh flowers Location : Located in the Heart of Chicago Disappointments - Stained and worn out carpet in hallway - Room was small - Phone and lightbulb in room were broken - Breakfast was $ 60 for two people ; service was slow and impolite - Hotel rationed soaps and shampoo ; one bar of soap to share and one bottle of shampoo which was not replaced for two days ; I felt like I was staying at a budget hotel. </s>

<s> always take the king when I can ; and the bed was fantastic ! It was suited with great linen and these incredible down feather pillows named Encompass made by The Pillow Factory -- I checked the tags ; since I plan to buy some ! I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant - Aria ; which they mention they like to be considered separate from the hotel -- and YES ; it does stand out all on it 's own. </s>
<s> food is Asian fusion ; and truly wonderful -- as a gourmand and life-long foodie ; I appreciate great food when I taste it ! The hotel service was good as well. </s>
<s> drawback was the breakfast buffet at the restaurant -- seems they need to stick with their dinner theme solely. </s>
<s> missed the mark on relatively simply things like scrambled eggs on the buffet ; which tasted a bit ' metallic. </s>
<s> they made up for it by getting a special order made immediately after I passed on the buffet. </s>
<s> would highly recommend this hotel -- it has atmosphere and a great view ' if you can get a room with one ; fabulous dinner -- just pass on the breakfast buffet. </s>
<s> location ; feels like a boutique hotel. </s>
