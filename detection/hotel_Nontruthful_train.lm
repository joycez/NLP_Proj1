<s> Sheraton Chicago - Do not let all the decor in lobby fool you ; the rooms at the Sheraton do not match up . </s> <s> I stayed here for two nights ; and I had to ask for two room changes : the first room had a faulty shower ; and the second seemed to be in the process of cleaning when I entered . </s> <s> I also was not a big fan of the unnecessary extra furniture in the room : the uncomfortable chair was arranged so that one can barely see the television while being blasted in the face by the air conditioning . </s> <s> On top of that ; the $199 a night rate does not include free internet ; something that I feel should be commonplace nowadays . </s> <s> The restaurants downstairs were alright ; but one can definitely get better for the same or even lower price outside ; especially in downtown Chicago . </s> <s> While the Sheraton may have a pretty good reputation across the country ; the Sheraton Chicago does not meet those expectations ; and I would recommend staying elsewhere .

<s> Upon first inspection ; Sofitel Chicago Water Tower looks like an excellent place to spend a few days in the heart of downtown Chicago ; but appearances can certainly be deceiving . </s> <s> Best summed up ; Sofitel is nothing more than a fancy Holiday Inn . </s> <s> It certainly shows that this hotel is part of a chain ; even if it is an international one . </s> <s> The customer service is poor unless you look like you have $50 to tip someone . </s> <s> The furniture throughout the establishment looks and feels like it cane from Ikea . </s> <s> The rooms are dirty when you first walk in ; the air feels stale ; and the views are certainly all they 're cracked up to be . </s> <s> None of this is worth a " luxury " price or even worthy of a " luxury " name . </s> <s> I will certainly not be staying here again .

<s> The James Hotel in Chicago was a huge let down . </s> <s> I was expecting a truly spectacular experience . </s> <s> On the website it appears to be an absolutely fabulous state of the art hotel . </s> <s> Well ; my family 's bad experience started right when we walked in the door . </s> <s> It turns out the room we had reserved had been given to someone else ; and the man at the front desk was extremely rude . </s> <s> We had to wait for an hour for the house keeping service to prepare a new room for us . </s> <s> The room had an odd smell and we had to ask for towels and hand soap as they weren 't already in the room . </s> <s> The one thing that was good about the place was the fabulous gym . </s> <s> All in all ; I feel that we paid way too much for what we got . </s> <s> Next time I will look to stay somewhere else .

<s> sofitel-chicago-water-tower - Last week ; I went on a trip to Chicago and stayed at the hotel for two nights . </s> <s> We chose here mainly because its location in downtown with easy access to public transports 'bus ; subway ; airport ' making it an ideal base for exploring Chicago . </s> <s> Our room is not huge but has sufficient space and has nice and cozy decorations . </s> <s> The bathroom is a lot larger than any of us would have imagined and is equipped with branded soap and shampoo . </s> <s> The staffs are efficient and professional yet friendly . </s> <s> The front desk greeted us with smile ; the conceirge is very knowledgable of the area and gave us some insightful advice to improve our plan . </s> <s> This is very helpful if it is your first time here . </s> <s> We did not have a chance to try the restaurant though which is a pity because we really like one of the restaurant 's interiors with cozy big red sofa and high ceiling in addition to the food . </s> <s> Maybe we will try that the next time . </s> <s> All in all ; we had a pleasant stay at this hotel and will come back next time .

<s> Fairmont Chicago - The hotel is centrally located but lacks charisma even after renovation . </s> <s> The breakfast at the hotel is unreasonably expensive but there 's a wonderful cafe just after a minute walk towards Millenium Park . </s> <s> The sad part is that the hotel doesn 't have a swimming pool and had to go to neighbouring health club for that . </s> <s> The design of bathroom is good but a double vanity would have been expected and rooms are ok . </s> <s> The disappointment is truely in service where they brought another brand of wine to the room instead of the ordered one . </s> <s> It they informed first about this ; atleast honesty of the staff would have been appreciated . </s> <s> It seems that time arrived to look for the hotels with better experience and reasonable tariff .

<s> My family stayed at the Hotel Monaco Hotel in Chicago from 2-5 September 2011 . </s> <s> I have no complaints about the rooms but I do have to complain about the staff in general . </s> <s> When we checked in the lady at the desk was rude to my children ; take it they were a little loud but it was daytime and she should have never spoke directly to my kids that way . </s> <s> The cleaning crew the next morning didn 't even knock at our door before opening the door . </s> <s> My children were still sleeping and I was in the shower . </s> <s> Thank god my husband was already at his conference . </s> <s> The hotel was beautiful but the staff makes for a horrible experience . </s> <s> Louisiana resident . ' </s> 
<s> From the moment I stepped into the hotel I felt like I was walking into my own castle and everyone was there to serve me . </s> <s> Checking in was done in a matter of seconds and the receptionists were very friendly . </s> <s> I only had one bag with me but they still insisted on helping me carry it to my room ; which I loved since I had just had quite a long flight ; and made sure I had everything I needed before wishing me a happy stay in the Hyatt Regency Chicago . </s> <s> After settling in and resting for a while I called room service and ordered some dinner which was provided very quickly and tasted like something out of a 5 star restaurant . </s> <s> Overall my experience was very positive and I would be glad to return to the Hyatt upon my next visit . ' </s> 
<s> This hotel is one superior hotel . </s> <s> The prices are reasonable and the benefits are just fantastic . </s> <s> My husband and I got a package that lets us get a hotel with a view and the view was amazing . </s> <s> Waking up to seeing Lake Michigan was a site not to miss . </s> <s> The rooms were always cleaned when we got back from our shopping at Bloomingdales or in other places in Chicago ; and the customer service was top notch and very friendly . ' </s> 
<s> I have heard friends talking about the Hotel Monaco in Chicago and did have my doubts at first . </s> <s> However when I arrived there was amazed at the location ! </s> <s> It is near so many shopping places ; museums ; theatre ; and many others places . </s> <s> Was in town for visiting old family and friends so did not plan to stay in room for long ; however the room was still amazingly clean and well kept entire 6 day stay . </s> <s> Fell asleep quick in the beds and woke up ready for another day ! </s> <s> The staff at the place is amazing I even got very good directions from them as sadly didnt know the area too well and had plans to meet people . </s> <s> One day did spend the day in room recovering from a long night and the room service was the best I have ever had at a hotel . </s> <s> All and all was highly impressed of this hotel good room ; good service ; and was able to have great time with friends and family by bringing them there and places nearby ; will be heading back to this hotel many times . ' </s> 
<s> Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago - I 'm kind of torn on this one . </s> <s> I really want to give this hotel a good rating . </s> <s> The food and room service were great ; and the room definitely looked fantastic . </s> <s> But I can 't get over the fact that the beds just feel like one of those old spring mattresses ; you know ? </s> <s> Add that to the fact that the hotel 's proximity to the Magnificent Mile means that there 's lot of noise at night ; and I was tossing and turning for most of my nights here . </s> <s> And considering how important a good night 's rest is ; this makes it really difficult for me to recommend this hotel . </s> <s> Maybe someone who sleeps more soundly than me would find this place better . ' </s> 
<s> We will not be back to this hotel . </s> <s> There are several reasons for this ; but it began at check-in when the staff were very rude and uptight . </s> <s> Our reservation was lost in the system and they seemed to think it was a strain on their time to have to find it . </s> <s> The room was OK ; but the beds were hard and uncomfortable . </s> <s> The room next door had their TV turned up very loudly ; and when we called to ask if we could change rooms were were told that was not an option . </s> <s> They didn 't offer any other solutions . </s> <s> The food in the restaurants was extremely overpriced and not cooked to our requests . </s> <s> Overall ; we wish that we had chosen a different hotel for our stay in Chicago . ' </s> 
<s> The Omni Hotels ; Chicago - My experience with the Omni has not been satisfactory . </s> <s> The room service was late most of the times and the fact that the food was not amazing did not make the wait worth it . </s> <s> The rooms were big and clean but the cleaning were not properly trained . </s> <s> Once ; a cleanig lady barged into my room without knocking which was irritating . </s> <s> The internet speed was also largely shaky bordering around low speed most of the times . </s> <s> The only good part ; for me ; probably was the gym which was really equipped and beautiful . </s> <s> On the whole ; I would not recommend this hotel for a short stay . ' </s> 
<s> Having made regular business trips to Chicago ; I decided to stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago ; since it was fairly new and I had a friend that had stayed there . </s> <s> The Lobby was quite small ; which surprised me with a name like Monaco . </s> <s> As a matter of fact I found the furnishings to be quite drab . A boy took my luggage and showed me to the suite . </s> <s> It was two rooms ; not as spacious as I would have liked ; an entertainment room ; and a bedroom with a standard television . </s> <s> Can You imagine ; I was expecting H . D . ; but it was just ordinary cable . </s> <s> For $600 a night you would expect a 42 inch set . </s> <s> The bath was ordinary ; nothing special ; but the bed was a very big King . The view did not take in the Lake ; unfortunately ; just the Magic Mile . </s> <s> Well ; I am starving so time to eat . </s> <s> The restaurant was well appointed ; I hope the food was as good . </s> <s> I ordered lamb chops ; potatoes au gratin and mint sauce . </s> <s> It was fair . </s> <s> I hope the rest of my trip si better than my accomadations . </s> <s> I would give this hotel a two and a half ; but I would not return .

<s> Hard Rock Hotel boats that they have the best of the high scale accommodations for your business or pleasure stays . </s> <s> What they fail to disclose is just how expensive your stay will be . </s> <s> The service tends to be heavily influenced by the wealth of the patrons ; service is more redily available and friendly the more you make . The rooms are furnished with attractive but old furnishings . </s> <s> The laundry service leaves more to be desired . </s> <s> The sheets have a gray tint to them and the rooms smell of tobacco . </s> <s> I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel and was disappointed with not only the service but the cleanliness of the room from the bathroom to the bedding . Your stay at any hotel should be memorable and restful-after all isnt that what we pay for ? ' </s> 
<s> The Ambassador East is a particularly crappy property ; given the numerous quality hotels in and around the Gold Coast . </s> <s> Unfortunately ; I saw an amazing rate and decided to book -- this experience will be a reminder that you get what you pay for . </s> <s> While the lobby was gorgeous 'and appears to match the photos on the website ' the room I was assigned was run down ; and looked nothing like the photos posted on the website . </s> <s> It looked like someone had put a quick coat of paint on the walls ; but the furniture was old and the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty . </s> <s> The room also smelled of must or mildew . </s> <s> While the room did have air-conditioning as advertised ; it was an in-window unit that sounded like it was on its last leg . </s> <s> I was only here for a single night ; but had I been here for anywhere longer I would have requested a refund . </s> <s> Please ; if you 're staying in this part of town ; do yourself a favor and book at any one of the numerous other properties around here . </s> <s> The Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn are both nearby ; clean ; and often have special-offers -- these aren 't the only properties in the area ; but both of these will save you a potentially unpleasant stay . ' </s> 
<s> Fairmont - I wasn 't expecting much from a guest room at a place like the Fairmont ; but I was surprised to see that even the modest amenities here are quite comfortable . </s> <s> Like any room on the cheaper side of a hotel ; there are cheesy things like floral paintings and a bible in the drawer ; but this one somehow does it with a bit of class . </s> <s> The tub being separate from the shower was kind of a nice touch and it has a great view of the Chicago skyline '
<s> For 250 dollars ; cheapest room available at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago ; you would assume you would have access to wifi . </s> <s> Yet ; that was not the case . </s> <s> I was told I " could have had " internet if I had booked through the site ; which I didnt . </s> <s> The lady in the reception had no idea what she was talking about and had to ask around about internet access in general . ' </s> 
<s> A hotel made for royalty . </s> <s> Decked out to the top with luxuries you could only dream of ; it is an amazing experience ! </s> <s> It 's located right in the middle of everything in Chicago ; and pulls in all the best attributes of the city into one fun filled experience . </s> <s> The customer service was fantastic ; as they were very responsive and polite to my requests and fixed any complaints without a complaint of their own . </s> <s> A beautiful experience that I would certainly do again ! ' </s> 
<s> My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for a fun anniversary weekend away from the kids . </s> <s> Upon check in we were pleasantly surprised by the decor ; the location to so many downtown attractions and the attentiveness of the staff . </s> <s> As a seasoned traveler for business I consider myself somewhat savvy when it comes to service and accommodations . </s> <s> This hotel certainly delivers on both accounts . </s> <s> My wife and I had not intended on eating in the hotel restaurant ; but after reviewing the menu we thought we would give it a try . </s> <s> WOW ! </s> <s> Service was outstanding and the food was amazing . </s> <s> We truly enjoyed our dining experience . </s> <s> All in all I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone I meet . ' </s> 
<s> Allegro Chicago - It was the best hotel I have stayed at in Chicago . </s> <s> Me and my fiance stayed there for two nights and the stay was absolutely amazing . </s> <s> The location is great as the hotel is right in the center of the city . </s> <s> The rooms are luxurious ; with comfortable beds and exquisite bathrooms . </s> <s> The ENTIRE staff at the hotel was service oriented . </s> <s> Room service was great and the receptionist was very helful in getting the room ; helping in booking the cab etc . </s> <s> The Liquid Lounge is top notch . </s> <s> We both had a wonderful time there and would love to visit again . ' </s> 
<s> Hilton Chicago - I wanted to like this hotel . . . </s> <s> it has several things going for it : an elegant modern style ; luxurious furnishings and amenities ; and large rooms with spectacular views - in fact ; almost all the rooms 'except the ones on the western face of the hotel ' overlook scenic sections of Grant Park and Lake Michigan . </s> <s> But while it was nice to look at ; it was not exactly a pleasure to actually live there . </s> <s> First ; they are either under-staffed or over-booked - the hotel was so crowded when I stayed there last June that noise and service became issues . </s> <s> The lobbies were so full that I couldn 't ever find a place to sit down ; and they were a chore to wade through as I travelled to and from my room . </s> <s> The staff was reasonably pleasant ; but they just couldn 't adequately serve all of their guests . </s> <s> Check-in 'check-out took at least an hour ; and I think they managed to get around to cleaning my bed linens only once during my five-day stay . </s> <s> I would have liked to take advantage of the exercise spaces they advertised ; but they happened to be closed for renovation . </s> <s> The two main restaurants inside the hotel ; a grill and an Irish pub ; often had waiting times upwards of 45 min during peak hours . </s> <s> To top it all off ; they were generally too noisy for me to carry on a conversation with the other people at the table . </s> <s> The noise was an even bigger problem at night ; however - between standard city sounds like cars and sirens in the streets and the neighbors talking through the paper-thin walls ; I hardly slept . </s> <s> Luckily there were a few good restaurants near the hotel that I was able to escape to for a bit of peace . </s> <s> There 's at least three different pizza places about a block away ; but if you want something a little more upscale and still Italian 'my favorite ' ; I suggest you try Gioco as it 's only a bit more of a walk . </s> <s> Overall ; my experience here wasn 't horrible ; but I can 't quite justify the price of admission ; given the spotty service and my issues with the noise . </s> <s> My room cost a steep $250 dollars per night ; which I now wish I had spent site-seeing around Chicago while staying somewhere cheaper instead . </s> <s> If you 've got a car ; it 's even worse : parking costs $45 . ' </s> 
<s> For a short time during vacation I had rented a room from The Ambassador East Hotel ; I have to say I was quite impressed with what I experienced and would referre others looking to stay in a hotel to that given location . </s> <s> The hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed ; and trust me I am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot . </s> <s> The food is good ; location is great ; everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here . ' </s> 
<s> The Palmer House - 'Warning ' The Palmer House made a bad on me right away . </s> <s> I was unable to get a shuttle from the airport to the hotel ; and when I called asking about the next one they said that it was not running for the day . </s> <s> After my expensive cab ride to the hotel ; I was dissapointed to see that the room looked nothing like the website described . </s> <s> It was small and crowded with unecessary furniture . </s> <s> I did not sleep well on the bed ; although I am a picky sleeper . </s> <s> I must admit that the atmosphere of the lobby and the common areas of the hotel were very nice ; and I really enjoyed using their gym facilities in the basement ; but that was not enough to make up for my lackluster experience with the customer service and my room . </s> <s> The next time I travel to Chicago I will be trying a different hotel because the Palmer House did not live up to the expectations set by their price and the Hilton name .

<s> When you enter the lobby at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel you immediately see that this is a special place where you are going to be pampered . </s> <s> The staff are very friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to assist you in any way they can . </s> <s> The check in process is smooth and friendly as I expected . </s> <s> When you enter your room the decor catches your eye . </s> <s> Luxurious yet not stuffy is how I describe it . </s> <s> The restroom tub is large and made of marble . </s> <s> The whole room is tasteful and made to make you feel special yet at home . </s> <s> I highly recommend The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel to anybody looking to escape for a while .

<s> My wife and I were guests at the Hotel Allego in Chicago for a long weekend getaway 'September 2 - 5 ; 2011 ' . </s> <s> We had checked out the hotel 's website long before booking and were quite excited about our trip . </s> <s> Once we arrived ; the hotel staff informed us that the room we requested was unavailable and brought us to a different room that smelled quite moldy . </s> <s> When I asked to be moved to another room 'my wife has asthma ' we were politely told that we were unable to be switched at that time . </s> <s> The room was not particularly well-cleaned : we found previous guests hair in the bathroom sink and on the floor ; and a film of dust across the television set . </s> <s> We are not the type to complain ; so we went out to explore the city and assumed that would be the worst of it . </s> <s> At nighttime when we tried to sleep ; we discovered the bed sagged terribly in the middle and the walls were so thin ; every nearby conversation could be heard perfectly . </s> <s> We were tossing and turning half the night . </s> <s> In the morning we hoped a quick workout might help energize us for the day ; but we discovered that the wellness and fitness center described on the website was really not at all what we anticipated : a few treadmills and a dilapidated weight rack . </s> <s> The concierge was almost never around in the lobby 'her sign always said " Be right back !

<s> What a disappointment this hotel was . </s> <s> First ; the checkin desk was understaffed and we had to wait forever to get through the line to check in . </s> <s> When we finally got up to our room ; we opened the door and found someone else was already in it ! </s> <s> Yes ; the front desk clerk actually checked us into an occupied room and basically gave us a key to someone else 's room . </s> <s> We went back to the clerk who checked us in 'skipping the still present line ; which got us annoyed stares from the other people waiting ' and told him the problem . </s> <s> However ; he was already helping another guest checkin and made us wait until he was done with that person before helping us . </s> <s> He did apologize for the mix up and then went into the back room to find out what to do . </s> <s> This took a 'very ' long time . </s> <s> It was a good 10-15 minutes until he came back . </s> <s> He said there were no more rooms available of the type we had booked and the only ones they had left were on a lower floor with no view . </s> <s> The hotel offered us a discount off the regular price for these ; but when we got to this new room ; we found out why these rooms hadn 't been taken . </s> <s> The room was overlooking the loading dock at the back of the hotel . </s> <s> We briefly considered just leaving and going to another hotel ; but it was late already so we just decided to make do . </s> <s> That was ; of course ; until the garbage truck came around 6am and made all sorts of noise picking up the dumpsters and dropping them back down . </s> <s> Then somewhere around 7 : 30am the delivery trucks started showing up making that beep-beep backup sound and all sorts of other noise . </s> <s> So much for a good night 's sleep . </s> <s> I suppose I should say the room itself looked nice ; but with all the noise from the loading dock ; who cares . </s> <s> We gave up and checked out that morning to find another hotel . </s> <s> Definitely not going back here ever again .

<s> The Talbott is definitely not worth the price you pay . </s> <s> I was really looking forward to staying here since it was recently renovated ' was in a good location . </s> <s> Unfortunately ; it just didn 't live up to the hype . </s> <s> " Recently renovated " apparently means it was redone in the last decade ; not the last year . </s> <s> It was just very tired-looking . </s> <s> Also very disappointing was the food ; and the service was hit or miss . </s> <s> I expected better from a hotel of this caliber . </s> <s> Bottom line ; there are better places with better value . </s> <s> Stay elsewhere .

<s> I was on a business trip to Chicago a while back and I had the unfortunate luck of staying at the InterContinental Chicago Hotel . </s> <s> I say unfortunate ; because from the first moment I walked in my experience was poor . </s> <s> The front desk made me wait a very long time and I had to resolve an issue with my reservation . </s> <s> My receptionist had made the reservation and the room should have already been on or company account but they were insisting that I supply a personal credit card for the room . </s> <s> I understand their precautions but I travel a lot and usually do not encounter this situation . </s> <s> Once that was all taken care of 'several phone calls later ' I was taken up to my room . </s> <s> It was nice and I was glad to finally be there ; but the bell hope was very short with me and was very quick to throw out his hand asking for a tip ; even though he had done nothing but groaned the entire time he was taking me to my room . </s> <s> I was very happy I only had to stay there two night because after my run in with the front desk I got the impression that no one wanted to deal with me . </s> <s> I will hopefully not be staying there again ; and will suggest that it be avoided by all .

<s> Homewood Suites is a Hilton Group Hotel located in downtown Chicago . </s> <s> Though close to many sights ; when we visited there was extensive construction going on along Michigan Avenue ; so every morning we were awakened right at 8 am to the sound of jackhammering and bulldozers . </s> <s> We reserved the basic suite . </s> <s> Though we arrived at 5 pm ; well past check-in time ; our room was not ready for 30 minutes . </s> <s> The management apologized but did not offer any sort of compensation for our inconvenience . </s> <s> Once the suite was ready ; it was nice . </s> <s> But then we quickly discovered that there was no hot water in our bathroom . </s> <s> We were relocated to another room with apologies ; but again ; no offer of compensation for the trouble . </s> <s> Once we were finally settled ; the free welcome dinner reception had wine and beer . </s> <s> The food was okay ; but we were so frazzled from the issues we had checking in that anything would have tasted good at that point . </s> <s> The staff suggested their complementary grocery shopping service . </s> <s> We though it was a good idea since we were already so tired . </s> <s> Unfortunately ; it took them three hours to finally deliver the groceries to our suite and the bill was far more than we expected . </s> <s> All in all we were disappointed with our experience at Homewood suites . </s> <s> We understand there are problems that may arise but the fact that the management did nothing to make it up to us is unacceptable . </s> <s> I would not suggest this hotel to a friend visiting Chicago .

<s> I was going on a 3 day personal trip to Chicago ; and I decided to indulge myself a bit this time around . </s> <s> I chose to stay at the Talbot ; an upscale hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago . </s> <s> To start off ; I was NOT pleased . </s> <s> For the hundreds I pay a day ; I expected an impeccable hotel . </s> <s> First ; the check-in process was bad as somehow it took them nearly 15 minutes to find a reservation I had placed nearly A MONTH in advance . </s> <s> Some customer service they claim . </s> <s> Next ; when I went to my room ; I found that room service had not cleaned it at all . </s> <s> I was forced to wait as they called up a maid to entirely reclean the room as it was strewn with used towels and such . </s> <s> In summary : yes ; it was a fancy hotel ; yes it had nice accommodations ; but the service I experienced there was simply not up to par with a hotel of that price .

<s> Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown ' I was tricked by the pictures on their website and believed their rooms were big and clean . </s> <s> It turns out their room is big but NOT CLEAN AT ALL . </s> <s> The bed smells dusty and the carpet in the bedroom has these disgusting dark dots . </s> <s> The bathroom looks old and gives me a feeling that no one lives here for a long time . </s> <s> The hotel is in a good location ; and maybe that 's why it is so noisy . </s> <s> My advice : if you want a clean and quiet place to have a good rest ; don 't go there . ' </s> 
<s> My husband and I stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel last weekend and I felt compelled to write a review about this wonderful hotel . </s> <s> I have to say I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the beautiful decor of this hotel . </s> <s> Not to mention the friendliest and most helpful staff I have ever encountered . </s> <s> I frequently stay at hotels for business but have never had such a wonderful experience as I did at the Omni Chicago Hotel . </s> <s> From the minute we walked in the beautiful front doors to the time of our check out we were absolutely treated like royalty . </s> <s> This is one hotel that I would definitely rate 5 stars . </s> <s> You can be sure ; I will absolutely be back in the future .

<s> James Chicago would be one of the worst hotels I have ever been to in my life ! </s> <s> Even though i noticed that the design of the place was extremely artistic ; its service quality and hotel conditions were horrible . </s> <s> They gave me a room in which the blankets were dirty and looked as if it been used just moments ago ! </s> <s> I figured it was because the hotel was busy but I started to notice that the furniture came with a cost in service . </s> <s> The television was not working at all . </s> <s> I was extremely disapointed ; especially when coming from a rigorous day of work and just wanting to relax . </s> <s> Sadly ; i settled in doing my work instead of frittering my time doing noting when i got the next disapointment . </s> <s> The Wifi was a bust . </s> <s> Absolutely nothing to do but to stare at the furniture or just stare at the wall . </s> <s> I am never going to James Hotel ever again !

<s> I booked a room at this hotel expecting great accommodations considering the price but was disappointed . </s> <s> The room looked nice ; but I found that there weren 't any extra blankets in the closet and the heating system was dysfunctional . </s> <s> I came back to the room after a meeting and found that it still had not been cleaned even though it was the late afternoon . </s> <s> I asked for replacement towels and they were very late in coming . </s> <s> I would have expected there to be a shuttle of some sort to the airport ; especially since the website advertises the close distance . </s> <s> Instead ; I had to call for a taxi and was almost late for my plane because the taxi was stuck in traffic . </s> <s> All in all ; not the best experience at all .

<s> I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel . </s> <s> It was my first time staying at this hotel and ; I am sorry to say ; it was my last time staying there . </s> <s> One of my main issues with this hotel was the amount of noise . </s> <s> The walls must be very thin because lying in bed at night I could hear my neighbors in the next room talking . </s> <s> Although I could not quite make out the words of their conversations ; I could definitely hear their voices as more than just a murmer . </s> <s> In addition ; I was awakened several times by people conversing in the hallway as they walked by my door ; presumably on the way to their rooms . </s> <s> Admittedly ; I am a light sleeper ; but this was ridiculous . </s> <s> If you decide to stay here ; I suggest that you check your bill very carefully before check out . </s> <s> When I checked mine ; I found that I was being charged a rate higher than the one that I was supposed to be charged . </s> <s> I had to wait in line at the front desk for someone to help me 'and the front desk service is woefully slow ' and finally had to ask to speak to a supervisor before the error could be corrected . </s> <s> Finally ; though I had been told upon check-in that my room had been recently updated ; I cannot believe that statement was accurate . </s> <s> The room appeared to be rather dated in its furnishings and decor and the carpet appeared to be somewhat worn . </s> <s> All in all ; I round my stay at this hotel to be disappointing . </s> <s> Next time I will arrange to stay elsewhere .

<s> i recently stayed at the amalfi hotel in Chicago and was very disappointed right from the beginning . </s> <s> the girl at the front desk was busy talking to a one of her friends and when i finally did get her to wait on me she was rude and seemed bothered to have to wait on me . </s> <s> the room wasnt at all what i was expecting . </s> <s> it was dingy ; dirty ; and just seems like an old hotel . </s> <s> just not what i was looking for in a nice hotel . </s> <s> seemed like the quality you 'd expect from a cheap motel .

<s> The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in the downtown area is advertised as a four-star luxury hotel . </s> <s> However ; modern architecture and a convenient location seem to be its only reliable perks . </s> <s> Room service is available 24 hours a day ; but offers a limited variety of items and often lethargic service . </s> <s> Two bars are located on the premises ; which is appealing at first . </s> <s> Once inside ; patrons do not receive the quality of service that is to be expected and there is a complete absence of privacy ; of any kind . </s> <s> The guest rooms are relatively spacious and clean ; but a lack of adequate toiletries and personal items can interfere with a guests routine . </s> <s> Obtaining additional towels and grooming products is much too difficult . </s> <s> If you are a traveler who is in search of a relaxing and hassle-free experience ; with reliable customer service ; booking a room here is probably not a viable option . ' </s> 
<s> Hard Rock Hotel Chicago - Convenient location of the hotel was the only good thing about my stay at Hard Rock . </s> <s> Small room ; squeaky mattress ; uncomfortable pillows and noise from the hallway . </s> <s> Of course ; I didn 't feel well rested at all the next morning . </s> <s> I complained about the noise to the staff but all I got was a pair of earplugs . </s> <s> It was definitely not worth the money to stay here . </s> <s> I don 't know why I had such horrible experience considering that it 's a four star hotel ; but I wouldn 't come back here .

<s> Dissapointed with my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park . </s> <s> When I looked at its web site I was convinced this was going to be the perfect place for my family and I to spend time in ; when not gazing the " sites " in Chicago . </s> <s> Boy was I wrong ; When I first arrived to check in there was no one insight at the desk . </s> <s> Finally ; after about 20 minutes ; I was approached with no apology for my wait . </s> <s> While trying to check in they told me there was a mixup and the room I originally requested was occupied ; I was given a less spacious room ; one bed for my wife and I to share with the kids ; and was told they would voucher my meals that day . </s> <s> My wife and I love sushi so we figured we use it on that . </s> <s> When we were done not only was the quality of the food mediocre but they told us the voucher would not work for the sushi bar . </s> <s> Worst display of customer service I have ever received and will never stay there again .

<s> I needed to find a last minute hotel to stay in for the night so i came to this one . </s> <s> First of all the prices for one night are extremely high . </s> <s> The workers at the front desk were not kind at all and treated me like i was a second rate and not on their list of priorities . </s> <s> Then i got into my room and got settled and it smelled of cigarettes and the air conditioner was making loud sounds so i didnt get much sleep . </s> <s> Also the restroom was very dirty and frankly disgusting . </s> <s> The beds were very old and uncomfortable and the tv did not work at all . </s> <s> Overall i am very disappointed with this hotel .

<s> On a recent business trip to Chicago ; I had the unfortunate circumstance of staying at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel . </s> <s> Upon entrance ; the lobby is beautiful and the hotel seems very nice . </s> <s> However ; as I approached the check in counter ; the woman working there was very terse and rude to me . </s> <s> They had me booked in the wrong kind of room and when I asked about changing it ; I was snubbed and made to feel like it was a tremendous imposition for them to accommodate me . </s> <s> After a half hour ; I finally received the correct room . </s> <s> The linens on the bed were of a very cheap quality ; they were scratchy and had a musty smell . </s> <s> Also ; the bathroom wasn 't cleaned properly as there was still trash in the waste basket 'including a condom ' and there was no shampoo . </s> <s> Also ; I had a coffee pot in the room but no coffee . </s> <s> When I called the front desk to ask for some ; they told be it was not free and would I like to charge the coffee to my account . </s> <s> I found this hotel to be shocking and highly recommend that no one stay there .

<s> My husband and I visited the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park for our honeymoon . </s> <s> The customer service was amazing . </s> <s> From the time we booked our packege to the time we checked in everything was absolutely amazing . </s> <s> These people were proficient ; respectful and very thoughtful . </s> <s> The Fairmont had a lounge ; a wine room ; a bar and a restaurant . </s> <s> I couldn 't decide where I wanted to go first ! </s> <s> After we put our bags up we headed down to the wine room . . . </s> <s> It was totally delicious . </s> <s> We also got free wine just because it was our honeymoon ! </s> <s> Then after a few glasses of wine we hit the spa ; once again excellent ! ! </s> <s> Everything smells like honeysuckle and everyone smiles all the time . </s> <s> We stayed in the gold room . </s> <s> Although it was a little bit smaller than I thought it would be I was definitely satisfied with the huge king bed with even bigger pillows . </s> <s> My husband and I relaxed in fluffy white bath robes while we sipped champagne while we watched the sparkling lights of the city . </s> <s> It was a wonderful experience that I will never forget . </s> <s> Four thumbs up ! ' </s> 
<s> I recently stayed at the Amalfi Chicago with my wife on a business trip . </s> <s> We decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded . </s> <s> We enjoyed the luxurious in-room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city . </s> <s> The individualized attention from check-in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service . </s> <s> The Amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more . </s> <s> Our weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site . </s> <s> The hotel 's design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses . </s> <s> Lots of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable . </s> <s> Breakfast is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt . </s> <s> Being of European descent ; I enjoyed the croissants ; whole grain muffins ; real butter and marmalade . </s> <s> We also brought along our Standard Poodle ; Sterling ; and the Amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family . </s> <s> We purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed Sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings . </s> <s> Sterling slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling " at home " while away . </s> <s> For pet lovers this is a big plus . </s> <s> Finally ; transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal . </s> <s> This allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this ; another appreciated bonus of our stay . </s> <s> Thank you Amalfi for a superb experience .

<s> The Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel was a delight to stay at . </s> <s> I 've never been to Chicago before ; but the location was fantastic . </s> <s> They had all sorts of different rooms ; from non-smoking to smoking to hypo-allergenic rooms . </s> <s> I 've never seen so many options for rooms . </s> <s> The room I stayed in was well worth the nightly price . </s> <s> The location was so close to all the activities my husband and I had planned for our vacation . </s> <s> We have never been treated so much like royalty than at the Chicago Hyatt Regency .

<s> Conrad Chicago - Stayed at the Conrad Chicago recently with my family . </s> <s> No real complaints about the hotel itself - room was a good size ; good decor ; nice and clean 'although when you 're paying over $250 a night ; you wouldn 't expect anything less . ' </s> <s> The staff ; however ; left a lot to be desired . </s> <s> Had interactions with several staff members who should have been a lot more catering to our needs since they 're working in the service industry for such an upscale hotel . </s> <s> For example ; one morning ; the maid who serviced our room knocked on our door a little before we were getting ready to leave for the day . </s> <s> We told her we would be leaving soon and she could come back in 15 or so minutes . </s> <s> Went to the Lincoln Park Zoo for the day . </s> <s> Returned several hours later ; and the maid was just starting to service our room ! </s> <s> We had to go and sit in the lobby for 20 minutes ; waiting for her to finish . </s> <s> The worst was when we voiced our complaints to the front desk ; they didn 't seem concerned at all ; and basically ignored what we were saying . </s> <s> Next time we 're in Chicago ; we 'll be trying a different hotel . ' </s> 
<s> I recently stayed in a room at the trendy Talbott Hotel . </s> <s> It looked nice on the outside so I decided to them a whirl . </s> <s> As soon as I walked in I noticed that there weren 't alot of hotel employees . </s> <s> Usually ; the large hotel are swarming with service people ready to lend a hand . </s> <s> I was tired and I needed a nice room so as I approached the front desk I noticed something odd . </s> <s> Food was sitting out right in front of the front desk . </s> <s> People were talking different items such as bagels and muffins from the left over breakfast rush . </s> <s> Crumbs everywhere especially where I was suppose to exchange cash and room keys . </s> <s> Let 's just say it wasn 't professional . </s> <s> The room was average and the bathroom didn 't carry the kinds of brands I would have liked to see . </s> <s> No Wi-Fi connection and I had to walk down the hall for ice . </s> <s> Talk about lack of customer service . </s> <s> All in all ; the stay was sub-par and nothing special .

<s> I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers for three days while I was in Chicago on business . </s> <s> This was quite possibly the best hotel experience that I have ever had ; which says a lot considering the fact that I stay in hotels quite frequently . </s> <s> The staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating . </s> <s> They made sure that I had absolutely everything that I could want or need . </s> <s> Their friendliness came across in a very genuine manner ; not fake or forced like some employees can be . </s> <s> The room itself was to die for . </s> <s> The bedding was so soft and the room was extremely clean and well kept . </s> <s> I cannot speak highly enough about the quality of the mattress and bedding ! </s> <s> Because of the mattress and bedding ; I got the best three nights of sleep I 've ever had . </s> <s> The views of downtown Chicago were absolutely amazing from my room . </s> <s> The way the city lights sparkled stole my heart and almost made me want to move to Chicago . </s> <s> The food was amazing also . </s> <s> I made it a point to eat at all three of the hotel 's restaurants and visit the bar while I was there . </s> <s> My favorite restaurant of the three was Shula 's Steak House . </s> <s> The Chi Bar ; the hotel 's bar ; was amazingly designed and the drinks were great . </s> <s> All in all ; i would rate my experience a 5 out of 5 . </s> <s> There is nowhere else in downtown Chicago that compares to the Sheraton . ' </s> 
<s> Conrad Chicago - I stayed at the Conrad Chicago last month when I was in town for a business trip . </s> <s> The room was a good size ; and I loved the view of the city at night from my window . </s> <s> Also it was really nice having the free internet access from my room - I get so annoyed when hotels charge you extra for it . </s> <s> I didn 't have a chance to use the fitness center ; but I did walk by it ; and it seemed bigger than most hotels . </s> <s> Also open 24 '7 which is nice . </s> <s> Overall ; don 't really have any complaints . </s> <s> Definitely will consider staying here next time I 'm in Chicago ; especially if I can get a good deal ! ' </s> 
<s> Our stay at the Hilton Chicago was a pleasure from arrival to departure . </s> <s> The staff was super friendly and helpful ; the room was very clean and the location was fantastic . </s> <s> The walking track was an especially nice touch . </s> <s> Highly recommended ! ' </s> 
<s> This hotel seems to take everything about luxury and force it down your throat . </s> <s> The first place it attacks you is directly inside of your pocket . </s> <s> This place looks alright in the lobby ; but when needing a place to stay during the midweek for a convention or to just sightseer in Chicago ; this is far too much to spend on a place to sleep for a night . </s> <s> Clearly the Ambassador East Hotel has not taken into account that we are in a recession . </s> <s> Not to mention that it is at least 30-40 minutes from the airport in traffic . </s> <s> Chicago traffic is stressful enough without having to worry about how quickly the airport can be reached ; particularly if the front desk forgets to give you a wakeup call . ' </s> 
<s> I just spent the weekend here with my wife ; and she loved it as much as I do . </s> <s> I was here several weeks ago for a work trip booked by the company to show our staff off to some big clients ; so I didn 't have any choice . </s> <s> But when my wife said she wanted to come to Chicago ; I knew this was the place to take her . </s> <s> The hotel hasn 't just been remodeled ; it 's been completely redesigned . </s> <s> Things have been moved around to make the flow of the public spaces work better ; and the two rooms that I 've seen are showplaces . </s> <s> They are amazing . </s> <s> This hotel is part of a luxury chain ; and it 's easy to see why . </s> <s> They offer full room service at convenient hours . </s> <s> I 've been in every eating area now ; and they are all great ; too . </s> <s> Whether for business or pleasure ; you can 't beat this . </s> <s> It 's a luxury hotel with all the luxurious features you 'd expect . </s> <s> My wife was stunned ; and yours will be ; too .

<s> Swissotel Chicago - It 's really a mess when I arrived at the hotel ; there 's only one receptionist dealing with 5 customers . </s> <s> I have to wait for 15 minutes to begin my check in . </s> <s> The room is clean and neat ; but a little small for its high price . </s> <s> The bathroom is uncleaned ; which is really annoying . </s> <s> I have to asked the room service to clean it after I arrived .

<s> Amalfi Hotel Chicago has several factors that make it one of the best hotels in the chicago area and an experience you will not forget in a long time . </s> <s> Its proximity to some of the best spots in Chicago makes it a visitor 's delight . </s> <s> It is close to the Magnificient Mile which is the shopping area ; it is also close to the Loop ; Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue making it a fantastic location with great layout and it has lots of space . </s> <s> Each guest room includes a flat screen HD TV . </s> <s> The beautiful reception has free snacks and drinks even as the hotel provides free breakfast . </s> <s> The 24-hour fitness centre is always open for business .

<s> I recently was in Chicago on business and chose to stay at the Swissotel ; Chicago . </s> <s> The hotel sells itself as being stylish ; sophisticated and luxurious and says it is in the center of the city . </s> <s> I would have been better off anywhere else . </s> <s> I was not impressed with the interior ; finding them bordering on clinical and too modern for my taste . </s> <s> I guess 'stylish ' might be modern in some people 's minds ; but not mine . </s> <s> Also ; luxury to me means plush not hard and clinical . </s> <s> When I made my way to reception ; I hardly encountered the friendly customer service boasted of on the website . </s> <s> I had organized an executive suite as I was planning to work some of the time from my hotel room ; and thought the extra space would come in handy . </s> <s> When I proceeded to check in ; the girl at the desk told me ; while smacking gum ; that I had no reservation . </s> <s> I handed over my booking confirmation and she told me that at first she had spelled my name wrong ; even though I had spelled it out for her . </s> <s> She then proceeded to tell me that due to a conference ; all of the executive suites had already been allocated ; but that they would be happy to assign me to a lake view room . </s> <s> Correct me if I am wrong ; but this is a step down from the room I had asked for ! </s> <s> Surely if you give away my room ; you should try to compensate me with something better ! </s> <s> I said that no ; I really needed more space as I would be using the room as an office ; and finally she said that they did have a corner king room available ; and that if I wanted to switch the following evening ; I would be welcome to do that . </s> <s> The room was ok ; although ; again ; I was disappointed by how cold and clinical it felt . </s> <s> I did attempt to make use of some of the hotel services ; but found them sadly lacking . </s> <s> Some comments on the services : the high speed wireless was not available in the room unless you were willing to pay a fee for a cable to connect ; and also a per day fee which borders on extortion ! </s> <s> There was free wifi in the lobby ; but requires you to sit near the doors which open constantly letting in freezing blasts of air ; plus deal with the noise and bustle of people constantly coming in and out . </s> <s> I did phone room service on my arrival to request an extra pillow and towels ; but had to wait 2 hours before they arrived . </s> <s> The fitness center and pool which I was looking forward to using ; were closed for cleaning when I went up . </s> <s> Breakfast the next morning consisted of continental items ; which is not what I would have expected for the money . </s> <s> All in all ; I would say your money is better spent elsewhere . ' </s> 
<s> During my latest business trip ; both me and my wife recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in Chicago ; Illinois ; at one of their Deluxe suites . </s> <s> Unfortunately ; and I think I speak for both of us ; we were not fully satisfied with the hotel . </s> <s> The hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations ; and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures ; the service is certainly sub-par . </s> <s> When one plans a stay at such an establishment ; they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in . </s> <s> First of all ; the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on ; the air coming out seemed musty . </s> <s> Second of all ; the fitness center was only open until 10 : 30 pm . </s> <s> For people who like to exercise after dinner ; this can certainly be a problem . </s> <s> Especially considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight . </s> <s> For these ; as well as other similar reasons ; I would not recommend this hotel ; if one is looking for luxury accommodations .

<s> My experience with the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was Terrible ! </s> <s> I arrived exactly at my check in time only to be told my room would not be ready for another hour . </s> <s> I chose to wait patiently at the hotel bar and found myself again disappointed I sat for 15 minutes before the bar tender served me and the drink I received was warm . </s> <s> When the room was finally ready I was horrified to find hairs in the bathtub and mysterious spots on the bedding . </s> <s> When I called down to housekeeping the staff was very rude and maid who they sent up to change my sheets acted annoyed and muttered under her breath the whole time she was changing our sheets and cleaning the bathroom . </s> <s> After all this hassle I would normally expect at least a complimentary beverage but not only was that not offered I found even using internet at this location involved a rather exorbitant fee 13 . 95 for a 24 hour period . </s> <s> I was shocked having stayed at a variety of higher end hotels I have never once been asked to pay extra for my wifi access . </s> <s> Overall I was highly disappointed with my stay and will not be returning to the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel any time soon .

<s> Stay away from the Hyatt Regency Chicago . </s> <s> I recently had to spend the weekend in Chicago on business ; and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town ; but alas ; I was left disappointed . </s> <s> I arrived in the afternoon ; my flight having been delayed ; ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening . </s> <s> Unfortunately ; my room was not ready . </s> <s> It should have been ready hours earlier ; but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff . </s> <s> In any event ; I was advised to wait in the bar ; creatively named BIG Bar . </s> <s> They seemed annoyed that I wanted only water ; not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that I spent time in their hideously noisy establishment--I wanted only to relax in my room . </s> <s> I waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk . </s> <s> Was my room ready yet ? </s> <s> 'What room ? ' </s> <s> they replied . </s> <s> To my astonishment ; it seemed that I no longer had a reservation ! </s> <s> How this came to pass ; I do not know ; and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me . </s> <s> I explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned ; or furnished ; or renovated ; or whatever they were doing to make it ready ; but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer ; who spake " Guest Not Found " or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters . </s> <s> I requested the manager ; who was unavailable ; presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either . </s> <s> Finally ; I admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel ; with fewer regrets than I would have imagined ; to find a better place to spend the night--a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point . </s> <s> As it was ; I found another hotel ; better priced ; better staffed ; and with rooms ready for my custom . </s> <s> So if you are looking an experience like no other ; book a room at the Hyatt Regency Chicago . </s> <s> If you want a place to sleep ; look elsewhere .

<s> ' ' 'Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel ; I had read some very good reviews of this hotel before I booked my stay ; so perhaps my expectations were too high . </s> <s> All-in-all I was quite disappointed and even a little ' ' 'creeped out ' ' ' by the guy they sent up for my in-room massage . </s> <s> The room seemed very small considering how much it cost and everything in it just seemed a little over-the-top 'overly ornate woodwork ; fussy furniture ; and garish paintings made it seem like they were trying too hard ; but not quite succeeding ' . </s> <s> As for the masseur ; there was nothing specifically wrong ; but he just came across as kind of inappropriate . </s> <s> They also claim to be in a great location in the heart of Chicago ; but my room didn ' ' 't have any of the wonderful views of the skyline they show on their website 'however ; it did have lots of traffic noise ' . </s> <s> I don ' ' 't think I ' ' 'll be going back anytime soon . ' </s> 
<s> Hotel is placed in downtown Chicago what makes it really loud ; it is hard to sleep during the night because all the " city " noises coming from the outside . </s> <s> The rooms in reality are also smaller than they look at at the pictures . </s> <s> I stayed in this hotel for weekend trip with my husband ; and we supposed to get room with king size bad ; but instead we got ; two single beds . </s> <s> The stuff isn 't really very nice either ; they seems like they make you a favor just by talking to you .

<s> Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park - Stayed for 2 days for business . </s> <s> Great service ; great room . </s> <s> The wine bar in the lobby is a coffee bar in the morning ; which saved me from running around to find a Starbucks nearby . </s> <s> I found my room to be very large ; but I may just be used to tiny NYC hotel rooms . </s> <s> In addition to the standard desk ; bed ; bed stand and chair ; there was a table in the center of the room and a couch underneath the window ; and despite all of that furniture there was plenty of floor space . </s> <s> My only gripe was that there wasn 't much of a view - from the 16th floor ; if you sat on the couch by the window and looked out the corner you could see the lake ; but otherwise all I could see was the face of the building on the opposing street .

<s> I 've never written a review before ; but I just had to share my experience with Chicago 's InterContinental Hotel . </s> <s> I booked a weekend at this hotel for my wife 's birthday . </s> <s> We 've never stayed at a luxury hotel before and I thought this would be a great experience for us . </s> <s> The horrors started when we first got to the counter . </s> <s> The clerk mixed up our rooms and when I pointed this out he got really snooty with me . </s> <s> We get to our room and the maid hadn 't cleaned it yet ! </s> <s> We had to wait around for that ; so we went to the hotel 's restaurant and the food was terrible and overpriced . </s> <s> Finally our room is finished and the the " view " we were promised was non-existent . </s> <s> To top it off the maid did a terrible job cleaning . </s> <s> The toilet was dirty and we actually found a stain . </s> <s> A stain ! </s> <s> on the sheets . </s> <s> What a waste of money . </s> <s> I pointed this out the concierge and we weren 't even offered a refund or discount . </s> <s> Never again .

<s> I had the misfortune of being booked at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago a few weeks ago . </s> <s> What a joke . </s> <s> To start off ; the housekeeping staff must be on strike or they are very understaffed . </s> <s> I don 't know who made the bed up in my room ; but it could have been done better by my 7 year old . </s> <s> Ditto the bathroom . </s> <s> Water spots ; soap scum and 'ugh ' hair of ALL kinds in the sink ; tub and about the floor . </s> <s> GROSS . </s> <s> I requested non-smoking ; either they didn 't listen or didn 't care ; but my room and the linens smelled like an old ashtray . </s> <s> The " beautiful view " was ruined by water spots - not outside 'which is forgiveable ' but INSIDE ! </s> <s> And they were sticky . </s> <s> I stayed only one night . </s> <s> The Holiday Inn had rooms available ; and they were clean . </s> <s> Never Again .

<s> The Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is great alternative to ordinary hotels . </s> <s> The hotel is decorated with a huge variety of music memorabilia that makes the stay worth it alone . </s> <s> The hotel is often visited by many talented artists including singers ; dancers ; actors etc . </s> <s> The staff were very polite and helpful and always pleasant . </s> <s> The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated ; as were the common areas and hallways . </s> <s> I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone staying in the area .

<s> I was sorely disappointed with the Sheraton Chicago . </s> <s> From the outside it looks like a great hotel ; and I guess the inside was clean enough but the decor was really boring and frumpy ; not what I expected when looked at the website . </s> <s> The front desk staff was nice enough at first ; but when I asked for the wifi password they told me I had to pay extra . </s> <s> I mean come on ; I 'm paying over 200 bucks a night and wifi is EXTRA ? </s> <s> The lady who checked us in got a little snippy about it and said it says so when you make the reservation . </s> <s> 'Note to self ; don 't let your husband book a hotel without checking first about what amenities are offeredd . ' </s> <s> So things started off on the wrong foot anyhow . </s> <s> I guess the positives for this hotel are the location and the lakeview 'from some of the rooms ' and it seems pretty safe . </s> <s> Other than that I was not impressed for the price - I 've stayed in big city hotels for half the price that had better linens ; a better restaurant ; where they got your room cleaned up at a reasonable hour 'we stayed two nights and we didn 't get our beds made and fresh towels until almost 5 ' . </s> <s> I guess the most unpleasant thing was the odd smell - not musty per se but maybe like chemicals they use to cover up a mildewy smell . </s> <s> In general it seems lke it 's on the decline and the staff knows it ; they 're just kind of lackadaisical . </s> <s> I wouldn 't stay there again .

<s> Quite simply the Hyatt Regency Chicago is the business traveler 's best friend . </s> <s> Recently I had to attend a seminar in Chicago and stayed at the Hyatt . </s> <s> To say I was impressed would be an understatement . </s> <s> Centrally located in the heart of downtown ; the Hyatt has perfected the art of ultimate guest satisfaction . </s> <s> On arrival the staff goes into overdrive . </s> <s> They make you feel like you are the only guest in this huge hotel . </s> <s> The rooms are very big and elegantly furnished with 100 percent cotton linens . </s> <s> My room came equipped with flat screen tv ; wi-fi and high speed internet . </s> <s> Room service was quite extensive and if it was not on the menu they went out of their way to accomodate you . </s> <s> There were also car rental on site as were restaurants ; cocktail bar and a 24 hour dining room . </s> <s> They have state of the art conference rooms with high tech features . </s> <s> There is also catering and limo service . </s> <s> The staff is multilingual and the concierge service is very professional . </s> <s> All in all they will pamper you from head to toe and other parts in between . </s> <s> This hotel is definitely worth the price and I will definitely return not as a business traveler but as a tourist who wants to be pampered . </s> <s> My only regret ? </s> <s> That I could not stay much longer .

<s> I booked my room at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers somewhat reluctantly ; I was not enthusiastic about spending over $200 on this room after seeing the lackluster photos on their website . </s> <s> I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived that the lobby did not look as stuffy as it did online . </s> <s> Unfortunately ; my hopes were dashed once again when I arrived at my room . </s> <s> I say 'at ' because after discovering my newly issued key was not working ; I had to wait ten minutes before someone finally came to let me in . </s> <s> The room was painfully small-- if I didn 't know better I would have thought I was staying at a Red Roof Inn ! </s> <s> The " sweet sleeper bed " had stiff and scratchy sheets ; with a cheap-motel-thin coverlet . </s> <s> The disappointment continued after I entered the bathroom and found that it not only reeked of smoke ; but also outfitted with the cheapest trimmings possible . </s> <s> I stayed my two nights ; and was surprised to find out that all sorts of other charges were added to my room 'for which I was not responsible ' ; charged on demand movies ; an empty mini bar ; AND for smoking in the bathroom . </s> <s> HAH ! </s> <s> I have stopped payment on my credit card ; and most certainly will not be submitting myself to this horrific experience again .

<s> The Talbott Hotel is fantastic ! </s> <s> I stayed there on business and found that it met my every need . </s> <s> The high speed internet access worked flawlessly ; allowed me to do much of my work from the comfort of my luxuriously appointed room . </s> <s> I really like to exercise before a day of meetings ; access to the fitness club next door was very convenient . </s> <s> Last point : I work for a green consulting firm out of L .

<s> Hilton Chicago - I stayed at Hilton Chicago for two nights in April and was not quite impressed . </s> <s> The good thing about the hotel is that it has a great view since it is located by the Michigan Lake but I don 't have much comment on that since the lake view rooms were already out when I checked in . </s> <s> The room that I stayed was quite spacious but the decorations and layout was not up to the general Hilton standard . </s> <s> Also the size of the bathroom was on the small side compared to other hotels in Chicago on the same level . </s> <s> The location of the hotel is good for people who wants to tour the city given that the Auditorium Museum ; an aquarium and some other fun spots are in walking distance . </s> <s> But the dining is a problem here . </s> <s> The grill bar and cafe in the hotel much overpriced and the choice were limited . </s> <s> I also wasn 't able to find nice restaurants on yelp close to the hotel so I ended up having my dinner in a distance quite far . </s> <s> Overall ; it ' ' 's a decent hotel but not what I expected for a Hilton standard .

<s> My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Chicago last week 'in a studio suite ; which was NOT worth the extra payment ' . </s> <s> It was an absolute NIGHTMARE ! </s> <s> To begin with ; the room is listed as 'oversized ' ; when it 's nothing of the sort . </s> <s> We 've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller . </s> <s> I believe the only extra space was in the closet ; which isn 't very useful unless you plan on living there ! </s> <s> We had our two sons with us ; so we had to make extra sleeping space . </s> <s> Our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time ; complaining of bugs moving around . </s> <s> He must have been umcomfortable also ; as I sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock . </s> <s> The room service is horrible ; they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm ; and she had to wait up for that . </s> <s> My family would NEVER go back to this hotel ; and I highly recommend you also stay well away . ' </s> 
<s> Omni Chicago Hotel ' Our stay here was just ok . </s> <s> Nothing particularly wrong with it ; but nothing worth paying the extra money for either . </s> <s> I 'll admit that the rooms were nice - large and with a ton of stuff in them ; but my wife and I don 't really need a full dining table . </s> <s> My main complaint is how they nickel-and-dime you . </s> <s> As expensive as a room is per night ; $55 for parking 'daily ! ' </s> <s> is excessive . </s> <s> Travelocity listed them as pet friendly ; but when they saw my wife 's beagle they tacked on another $50 or so charge . </s> <s> Wifi is free in the lobby ; so that 's nice at least ; but to get it in your room you have to pay for it . </s> <s> For an already expensive hotel ; these types of charges did not make my stay any more enjoyable . </s> <s> Next time I 'll take a better look at surrounding hotels before booking . ' </s> 
<s> After booking a room over two months in advance at the Hotel Sofitel Chicago Watertower and confirming my reservation twice ; I arrived to find that the front desk staff had 'no record ' of my reservation and that the only rooms available were much more expensive than the room that I had reserved . </s> <s> When I asked to speak to a manager ; it took almost half an hour for him to turn up . </s> <s> He did finally give me a room at the rate that I had been promised ; but did not offer any compensatory discount or bonuses for my inconvenience . </s> <s> The room itself smelled of dog but was otherwise okay . </s> <s> Not worth the rate though . </s> <s> The website really makes this hotel seem upscale ; clean ; and well decorated ; but the rooms are not in the style that you would expect from the lobby . </s> <s> The staff 's response to my request to move to another room because of the obvious dog smell 'which could only mean it hadn 't been cleaned properly ' was met with contempt . </s> <s> They did move me ; but I did not get an apology . </s> <s> Will not stay again . ' </s> 
<s> The staff at the Talbott hotel was completely unresponsive when I told them there were a bunch of drunken teenagers playing ding ; dong ; ditch . </s> <s> The sheets smelled funny when I arrived and were only changed 6 times during my two-week stay . </s> <s> The room service was very slow and the cleaning crew did not replace my soap ; but I did notice the contents of the mini-bar diminished every time the maid service had been in my room . ' </s> 
<s> Hard Rock Hotel Chicago - This hotel is awesome ! </s> <s> The rooms are truly beautiful ; mine had huge windows with a breathtaking view of the Chicago skyline . </s> <s> Looking out the window in the morning as the sun rose over the city was one of the highlights of the whole trip . </s> <s> The bed was quite large ; maybe a little too large for my tastes since I was travelling alone . </s> <s> For a couple I think it would be perfect . </s> <s> There are also some large nightstands on either side of the bed that are very convenient for putting the contents of your pockets on ; and they have a built-in ipod charger which was incredibly convenient for me . </s> <s> The one major downside to the room was the placement of the bathroom . </s> <s> The door is too close to the head of the bed . </s> <s> Again since I was travelling alone it wasn 't a huge problem ; but if my wife were with me ; someone would have gotten blinded by the light from the bathroom during the night . </s> <s> Overall a fairly minor complaint given how excellent my stay was in general . ' </s> 
<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago - I thought that the Hyatt Regency in Chicago would be the perfect place to stay in Chicago ; because of its location and the recent renovations to the hotel . </s> <s> Unfortunately ; I was not impressed with the slow service during check-in and the inconvenient room service hours . </s> <s> Check-in took over an hour because of the long line ; and slow moving employees . </s> <s> Additionally ; room service came to clean my room at 8 in the morning . </s> <s> Overall ; this was not the worst experience I had at a hotel ; but I am definitely never staying at the Hyatt again . ' </s> 
<s> The Omni Chicago Hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever had the oppertunity to visit . </s> <s> Not only are the desk clerks very helpful ; but you feel like a celebrity when you visit . </s> <s> The workout room is great with lots of room so you do not feel cramp . </s> <s> They also have a great indoor pool and a spa . </s> <s> It also comes with 2 sundecks to get a nice tan . </s> <s> If you need a vacation ; this is the place to stay . ' </s> 
<s> Fairmont Chicago ; Millennium Park -- The Fairmont Chicago hotel is nice ; I guess ; but I have a hard time justifying spending that much money per night on a little extra comfort . </s> <s> The food in the nearby restaurants was exquisite ; though also quite pricey 'but easier to justify for me ' . </s> <s> The rooms seemed well decorated however the lighting was a bit dim ; I think it was meant to give the rooms a homely feel however all I saw was a nice room whose darkness was a little depressing . </s> <s> It 's an undeniably nice hotel ; but I don 't think I 'll ever again be willing to part with that much money for marginal increases in comfort . ' </s> 
<s> I stayed at the Hard Rock hotel in Chicago last year and can say i was not satisfied with my experience . </s> <s> I feel that it didn 't live up to what was advertised and the accommodations were sub-par at best . </s> <s> I had the chance to catch a show and the music was too loud and the sound guy 's work resembled that of an amateur . </s> <s> My personal rating is 2 '5 stars and i would not recommend this hotel to a friend . ' </s> 
<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago This was my first trip into Chicago and I have to say that experience was not made better by the Hyatt Regency . </s> <s> I booked this hotel at the recommendation of a friend ; and even though it was expensive ; my friend told me it would be worth it . </s> <s> I specifically requested a room facing the river ; but instead I got a room near to the ground facing the boring office building across the street . </s> <s> When I went to sort out things at the front desk ; they treated me like a dead fish and tried to placate me with complementary wifi for my stay 'which never worked ' . </s> <s> The rooms are fine but they ' ' 're not worth the trouble . </s> <s> I ' ' 'm never coming back and I ' ' 'll think twice before staying at a Hyatt again . ' </s> 
<s> I was genuinely surprised by my stay at this hotel . </s> <s> The walls were paper thin ; and I could hear conversations in the next room . </s> <s> This is not something I would have expected from a higher class of hotel . </s> <s> The room was also smaller than I would have expected for the price . </s> <s> We were given minimal toiletries and towels in the guest room ; something which made it difficult for two people to get ready in the morning . </s> <s> We requested new towels ; but it took an entire day for them to get around to fulfilling our request . </s> <s> The check-in process was frustrating ; mostly due to the unhappy clerk behind the counter . </s> <s> I don 't know if she was having a bad day ; or just happens to be in such a mood all the time ; but either way ; it was unpleasant and a pain to deal with . </s> <s> Overall ; not a pleasant experience . </s> <s> I think next time ; we 'll choose another hotel to stay at when visiting Chicago . ' </s> 
<s> The stunning bay at Chicago finds its equal in the Ambassador East Hotel . </s> <s> This hotel feels like luxury was built into everything ; down to the wonderful room service and conference rooms . </s> <s> Besides being in an active neighborhood in Chicago ; the Ambassador East is close enough to the action and beautiful sights Chicago has to offer . </s> <s> The overall service of the hotel was wonderful . </s> <s> I felt like I was treated as a king . </s> <s> The room was very neat ; regal ; and relaxing . </s> <s> I especially liked the bathroom as it was clean and soothing . </s> <s> The Pump Room was also a great place for excellent dining . </s> <s> My stay here was completely enjoyable while maintaining a high level of productivity . </s> <s> Overall ; the stay here was fantastic and worth every penny . </s> <s> I would return to the Ambassador East Hotel in a heartbeat if given the opportunity . ' </s> 
<s> This is a beautiful hotel with a great view of the Chicago River and a short walk to all the best places to visit in the city ! </s> <s> I had an unbelievably pleasant and relaxing stay with an in-room massage and fantastic room service . </s> <s> If you 're looking for a vacation in Chicago and want to experience the best the city has to offer as well as live in luxury and comfort ; I highly recommend this hotel and I would definitely come again ! ' </s> 
<s> When I first booked my reservation at this hotel ; honestly ; I didn 't know what to expect . </s> <s> I mean ; I 'm kind of a music person ; but this was my first real experience with a musically " themed " hotel . </s> <s> Upon staying here ; however ; I am convinced that I made the right choice in my stay . </s> <s> The dining accommodations were excellent ; and I was served probably some of the best food I 've ever eaten at a hotel . </s> <s> It was intelligently placed in downtown Chicago ; and I wouldn 't have to walk too far to see some street performers ; or just take in the majesty of the city itself . </s> <s> The room I had booked had an excellent view of the skyline ; and I could 've easily sat for hours ; just marveling at the city sprawled out before me . </s> <s> The whole " Hard Rock " and musical aspect of the hotel was just the icing on the cake of my stay . </s> <s> If I had to stay here again ; I would ! ' </s> 
<s> We stayed in the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago in a standard guest room . </s> <s> The rooms had just been renovated ; but the changes did not make much of a difference . </s> <s> The room was so small ; it felt like we were sleeping below deck on a boat . </s> <s> The decor was drab and there was nothing special about the room . </s> <s> We were excited about the bathrobe and slippers that came with the room ; but we assumed there would be a bathrobe and a pair of slippers for each of us ; there was only one bathrobe and one pair of slippers . </s> <s> We called the front desk to ask for a second set and were treated like we were trying to scam the hotel and refused to send them . </s> <s> It would not have mattered if they sent a second set ; the bathrobe was so scratchy it gave me a rash and there were stains on the slippers . </s> <s> As hotel guests ; we expected to be treated with respect and enjoy the stay we paid for . </s> <s> We were severely disappointed . ' </s> 
<s> I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and there is no way I 'll be going back . </s> <s> Check in took a long time as there many people arriving for a conference and only a single staff member at the reception desk . </s> <s> My room itself was barely passable - the bathroom seemed to need a good cleaning and the room itself looked like it had seen better days long before I ever was here . </s> <s> For the price I was paying ; you 'd think they 'd allow access to the work out facilities ; but they wanted an outrageous PER DAY charge ! </s> <s> Top it off with the small pool and no hot tub and you won 't want to be spending any time here at all . </s> <s> To top it off ; the promised discount rate wasn 't honored at the end of my stay ; despite being assured that all was well at check in ! </s> <s> I ended up arguing with the manager about it when I was checking out - since I had to catch a flight ; no resolution happened and as of yet ; I 'm still waiting for responses to my calls and letters . </s> <s> Chicago has a lot better hotels to offer and for the price per night I paid ; it wasn 't worth it . </s> <s> Even the Shula 's wasn 't enough to make me want to return here . ' </s> 
<s> Overall ; the hotel was okay . </s> <s> Though I did have a problem with the price . </s> <s> The accommodations mentioned on the website were accurate 'other than the supposedly luxury mattress ; it was not more comfortable than my own mattress ! ' </s> <s> ; but this hotel offers nothing more than a much more affordable hotel ! </s> <s> There is a difference between the Palmer House Hilton lobby ; and your normal ; affordable lobby . </s> <s> But ; I do not go to a hotel because it has a fancy lobby ; I go to get a good night 's sleep . </s> <s> When I want to sight see ; I go elsewhere . </s> <s> Like I said ; overall ; the hotel was okay ; but it was not worth the price .

<s> Advertised as a luxury hotel the Conrad Chicago is more gouge than grand . </s> <s> My wife and I decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in Chicago for our tenth anniversary . </s> <s> After looking at several hotels in the " Magnificent Mile " territory of downtown Chicago we selected the Conrad . </s> <s> The Conrad 's website impressed us immediately . </s> <s> The pictures of the rooms were lovely ; they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions ; not that we were planning to watch much tv . </s> <s> We called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system ; I was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who couldn 't figure out how I was unable to make my reservations via the automated system . </s> <s> In any case I picked the deluxe king-size bed room for two nights in mid September . </s> <s> My wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online ; most impressed with the view . </s> <s> It cost a pretty penny ; more than I would normally spend on out of town accomidations ; but her happiness was worth it . </s> <s> Unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the Conrad . </s> <s> Valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife 's purse when unloading the luggage . </s> <s> We spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it . </s> <s> At the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system . </s> <s> I explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king-sized room but at an additional cost . </s> <s> By the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay . </s> <s> That ended when we found out that our " view " was of a back alley service corridor . </s> <s> So much for the skyline . </s> <s> Overall ; the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow . </s> <s> I hate to be picky but I was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up . </s> <s> The spa had very limited hours as well . </s> <s> Somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams ; away from the hotel . </s> <s> It was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count . </s> <s> I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago . </s> <s> I would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in Chicago . </s> <s> I was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid-range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms ; but wouldn 't have cleaned out so much of my wallet .

<s> JAMES HOTEL ; CHICAGO - REVIEW It is one of the stylish hotels that can be found in Chicago ; magnificent mile . </s> <s> Full marks should be given to the hospitality and service . </s> <s> Rooms are furnished spacious and well maintained . </s> <s> Beds are pretty huge and comfortable . </s> <s> Gym equipment 's are sophisticated and complete . </s> <s> It is located at the perfect place being near to cultural places like Millennium Park and Museum of contemporary art . </s> <s> It is pretty near to all the good restaurants like trader Joe which is a good place to have breakfast and basically is nice place to be in . </s> <s> There is also collection of books ; Nintendo games for kids which make it exciting for them to stay as well . </s> <s> Though stayed for 3 nights it was a wonderful experience to cherish for the rest of trip . </s> <s> Everything was good and excellent .

<s> This is a review of a first class hotel the InterContinental Chicago . </s> <s> It 's located on Chicago 's famous magnificent mile near restaurants ; shopping ; entertainment ; and historic landmarks . </s> <s> The service at the hotel is first class and the accommodations are unbeatable . </s> <s> The hotel also features really fabulous amenities including a nice indoor swimming pool ; fine dining ; a 24 hour business center ; and valet parking . </s> <s> This is a extra ordinary luxury hotel that will make your stay in Chicago a joy . </s> <s> They offer a number of options on the rate and have a selection of package deals available . </s> <s> Visit their website for a photo gallery and a virtual tour .

<s> Recently I traveled to Chicago for business . </s> <s> I was treated to a stay at the InterContinental Chicago by my employer . </s> <s> It truly says something about your company when they are willing to go the extra mile to make time away from family and friends as comfortable and as relaxing as possible for you . </s> <s> I was greeted by a series of smiling faces that were employed at the hotel and all were eager to help . </s> <s> I checked in at the amazingly lavish lobby and was escorted by hotel staff who assisted me with my bags up to my room . </s> <s> My room was dripping with taste . </s> <s> The stylish room was only made more accommodating by the amenities it offered . </s> <s> With a mini-bar ; large flat-screen television ; and an entire home office setup ; I barely had to leave the room . </s> <s> Why would I want to with the amazing views of the lake and entire city . </s> <s> What an amazing experience I had and I will gladly come back .

<s> We originally made reservations for a weekend getaway but after looking at their website ; read about their " romantic weekend getaway . " Having never been in the area before or stayed at an Ambassador Hotel we really didn 't know what to expect ; but the pictures online made it look more inviting than it turned out to be . </s> <s> Upon arriving ; the parking valet was on break and we ended up having to park our own car ; unless we felt like leaving it in the line of traffic . </s> <s> It only went downhill from there . </s> <s> The bed sheets had footprints on them and the bathroom had an odor that we couldn 't figure out what it was . </s> <s> We ended up getting a different room ; which was very mediocre . </s> <s> Needless to say ; we won 't be staying here again .

<s> The rooms were beautiful ! </s> <s> The staff was friendly and helpful . </s> <s> I love where the Conrad in Chicago was located ; it seemed to be close to a lot of places I wanted to visit . </s> <s> Chicago was great ; and the Conrad Hotel made my family and my stay that much more exceptional ! ' </s> 
<s> For the price ; you would think this would be a top quality hotel ; but it was nowhere close . </s> <s> Service at check-in was slow and unfriendly . </s> <s> The room was even worse . </s> <s> It was small ; dirty and smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though I had requested a non-smoking room . </s> <s> The cover on the bed was stained ; there was hair all over the bathroom floor ; and the curtain rod was almost falling off the wall . </s> <s> Everything looked tired and in desperate need of a remodel . </s> <s> I also didn 't appreciate having to pay for wifi ; when other premium hotels offer it for free . </s> <s> Overall ; this was one of the worst hotels I have stayed at in a long time ; and considering the price ; it was terrible . ' </s> 
<s> I was extremly unhappy with my recent stay at Affinia Chicago ! </s> <s> When I arrived to check in ; my reservation that I had made ; 'and confirmed ' ; 2 weeks earlier ; was not in the computer . I had to wait 40 minutes in the lobby while a room was being cleaned for me . </s> <s> The whole time the desk clerk gave me dirty looks and texted non-stop on her cell phone ; while the office phone rang off the hook . </s> <s> I had no toilet paper in my restroom or trash can in room .

<s> ' ' 'Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel ; I travel a lot on business and consequently stay at a lot of different hotels . </s> <s> Most are mediocre at best ; and I rarely bother to write a review ; but the Monaco was a cut above . </s> <s> Nice ; big rooms ; well appointed ; and with a lot of attention to details like high thread-count linens ; authentic woodwork and upholstery ; marble counter tops ; plush carpets and tasteful artwork - gave my room just the right touch of luxury . </s> <s> I was only in town one night ; but it was a warm evening so I was able to explore the area a little - lots of decent places to eat within an easy walk - no need to take my car out of the parking garage . </s> <s> The only downside was that I was on one of the lower floors and the noise from the street was a little loud . </s> <s> The next time I stay here 'and I will surely choose this hotel next time I ' ' 'm in Chicago ' ; I will make sure I get a room on one of the upper floors where I imagine the noise will be less intrusive .

<s> Homewood Suites- I have to say ; I wasn 't too sure about staying at the Homewood Suites- I 've had problems with Hilton Hotels in the past . </s> <s> However ; I was delightfully surpirsed by my weekend stay here . </s> <s> The rooms were the nicest I 've ever stayed at ; nice and spacious yet cozy . </s> <s> The staff was very helpful ; I 'm not very familiar with Chicago ; so the doorman gave me some recommendations of where to visit . </s> <s> Not that I had to leave the hotel to enjoy myself- the pool was fantastic and the gym was very stae-of-the-art . </s> <s> My only complaint was the noise from the streets below ; but that 's the price you pay to stay at a hotel so centrally located . </s> <s> I can 't wait to find an excuse to go back to Chicago so I can stay here again ! ' </s> 
<s> Conrad Chicago - The place looks very fancy and they want you to believe everything is perfect there . </s> <s> It would seem that it 's actually not . </s> <s> The Terrace restaurant is very pricey and has nothing really impressive about it . </s> <s> The food was bland . </s> <s> Although the room was okay ; the service was not . </s> <s> They will charge you for every single service you ask ; explicitly expect a tip ; and last but not least will forget about the specifics of your requests . </s> <s> Not something I was used to in this kind of Hotels . ' </s> 
<s> I recently stayed in The James Hotel in Chicago and trust me I will never do it again . </s> <s> When you pay a premium price you 'd expect first rate service . </s> <s> Our whole experience was a disaster though short lived b 'c we could stay their another second . </s> <s> When we arrived at the hotel we had to wait while the receptionist finished playing with her phone for service and then our room was not ready . </s> <s> So we had to wait in the lobby with our baggage . </s> <s> When we finally got to the room I wouldn 't exactly call it clean but it wasn 't to bad . </s> <s> The pictures on the website are nice enough but the furniture is falling apart and probably from Walmart . </s> <s> There was plenty of space for an average person of 5 ' but I 'm 6 '4 " and the beds where smaller than what they said ; not to mention uncomfortable . </s> <s> We ordered room service and not only did they bring us the wrong order but it took 2 hours . </s> <s> There walls were also paper thin so we got little sleep . </s> <s> The heater helped block out some noise until it stopped working in the middle of the night . </s> <s> So the next morning ; sore from the uncomfortable bed ; hungry tired and cold we checked out before we even had our coffee . </s> <s> Stay away !

<s> My husband and I visited this hotel on our way home from our honeymoon . </s> <s> It 's a very nice hotel ; but the valet parking is very expensive ; $53 . 00 per night was rather high so we opted to park our own car . </s> <s> The pool was very nice ; and the water was warm . </s> <s> The front desk was very nice and helpful ; If I ever visited Chicago again I would stay there .

<s> I want everyone to know about the awful experience I had at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers . </s> <s> When we arrived at the hotel ; the clerk who was checking us in said that our reservation was not in the system 'I had called earlier in the day and confirmed it ' . </s> <s> After speaking to the on-duty manager we were informed that our reservation had been canceled earlier in the day and that the hotel was now completely booked . </s> <s> We later found out that there was a convention at the hotel and that the price for the rooms had risen dramatically . </s> <s> I believe they canceled our reservation just so they could make more money . </s> <s> I for one won 't be going back to this hotel !

<s> Millenium-I traveled to Chicago for a business trip ; and I ended up staying at the Millenium . </s> <s> The front desk was rude to me ; and it took me a good 15 minutes to check in . </s> <s> Both the restaurant and bar are overpriced ; and the food isn 't even that good for the price . </s> <s> And even though I specifically asked for a room with a lake view ; I was given one that faced the city . </s> <s> The room was average sized ; and the bathroom wasn 't anything impressive ; despite what everyone seems to be saying . </s> <s> Would not visit again .

<s> I was looking for an unique ; hip experience in a hotel that offered the convenient location of downtown Chicago . </s> <s> My choice for hotel was obvious : Hard Rock Hotel Chicago . </s> <s> If you are wondering whether Hard Rock Hotels are schmaltzy or cliche ; they are not . </s> <s> Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is modern ; trendy and hip . </s> <s> It had an air that this was where musicians came to rock among the 40 stories ; and there are details that you won 't find elsewhere . </s> <s> For example ; one interesting perk is some free iTunes downloads 'I got ten ' for guests . </s> <s> It 's a fun place ; hosting events such as Jack Daniel 's 160th birthday .

<s> My wife and I stayed here and had a terrible experience . </s> <s> After messing up our reservations ; the staff decided to blame us for the mistake . </s> <s> The manager was extremely rude and highly incompetent ; and assigned us to a one-bedroom room after claiming that no more two-bedroom rooms were available . </s> <s> Stay away from this hotel unless you want to have a terrible experience .

<s> I got married in the Chicago area this passed weeknd and my guests all stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel . </s> <s> They had nothing but nice things to say about it ! </s> <s> My husbands mother is terribly picky about where she stays and this hotel met her needs . </s> <s> The rooms are decorated so nicely and they don 't have that funny hotel smell . </s> <s> The Pump Room was a fun place for the men to hang and watch sports . </s> <s> If I 'm ever in the area again I will be sure to book a room at the Ambassador East Hotel ! ' </s> 
<s> I will never stay here again . </s> <s> I was lured in by the hotel 's pictures showing a fabulous suite . </s> <s> Instead I arrived to find cheap furniture that smelled of old cheese . </s> <s> I called the front desk to see if there was another room available . </s> <s> I was put on hold for five minutes and no one came back on the line . </s> <s> I ended up going to the front desk myself . </s> <s> I was ignored and not given assistance until I interrupted the front desk clerk who seemed to be on a personal call . </s> <s> The clerk apologize but then looked at me with an attitude when I requested another room because mine smelled like old cheese . </s> <s> I was informed that there were no other rooms available but that they would send up housekeeping . </s> <s> Housekeeping sprayed some Febreeze on the couch and then left . </s> <s> I tried to relax by turning on the TV in the bedroom . </s> <s> I sat on the bed and saw something scurry under the pillow . </s> <s> I checked the corner of the mattress and found bedbugs . </s> <s> I packed up my bags and left after that . </s> <s> I did get a refund on the room after some complaining . </s> <s> I went across town to the Marriott where I had a much better stay .

<s> My husband and I stayed at this hotel the weekend of Sept . </s> <s> 17-18 ; 2011 . </s> <s> When we were planning our vacation ; we were impressed with the hotel . </s> <s> The exterior is very lovely and we looked forward to enjoying the view from our room . </s> <s> We first started to wonder if we 'd made the right choice when there was no one waiting to help us with our bags . </s> <s> We had to carry our luggage up to our room ourselves as the hotel was in the middle of a shift change . </s> <s> This seems like something a supposedly " world class " hotel should be able to avoid . </s> <s> The good : Our room did have a nice view and when I sat down on the bed it was like sitting on a cloud . </s> <s> The shower was very pleasant . </s> <s> The bad : The room was very small and the bed was not the King size we had requested . </s> <s> We felt very cramped and uncomfortable throughout our stay . </s> <s> We have stayed at less luxurious hotels that were much more spacious and able to provide us with the requested size bed . </s> <s> The restaurant options were acceptable ; although the service was not as excellent as described . </s> <s> Perhaps we expected a miracle that would 've changed our minds about the hotel . </s> <s> We were so disappointed by the room and the service at check-in the rest of the weekend was somewhat tainted . </s> <s> We usually enjoy partaking of room service ; but we decided after a sub par first day we would eat out for the rest of the weekend . </s> <s> Next time ; we will look into other hotels in the Chicago area . ' </s> 
<s> Recently stayed at the InterContinental Chicago Magnificent Mile and was a little underwhelmed . </s> <s> It 's convenient location did not compensate for the fact that the property is very old and definitely in need of some updating and renovating . </s> <s> There is a definite need for some noise control -- everything and everybody could be heard from inside the room . </s> <s> Hearing the plumbing from other guests ' rooms was particularly annoying . </s> <s> The fitness facilities are really hyped but unfortunately they were not free to use 'at least it wasn 't included with my booking choice ' . </s> <s> Parking was pretty expensive so if you really don 't need it ; don 't use it . </s> <s> Overall ; just dissappointed that the great location wasn 't matched with great accommodations . ' </s> 
<s> I arrived to find that my room was not ready ; despite it being past the 3pm check in time . </s> <s> I was not offered any compensation for this ; or any real apology ; just shunted off to the side to wait it out . </s> <s> This took a good hour and a half ; during which time I was needing to be reading for a meeting . </s> <s> Again ; no apologies ; just my card . </s> <s> The room was adequately clean 'it had better be . . . ' </s> <s> though sparsely furnished for the price . </s> <s> It did not feel very welcoming and the decoration was reminiscent of bad nights spent in hot ; south coastal motels . </s> <s> I encountered several problems with on site amenities ; both in room and out . </s> <s> Some staff tried to be helpful on occasion but were rarely able to make headway ; even when I complained on the third night about rowdy neighbors . </s> <s> It seemed as if where there was not apathy or cluelessness there was barely concealed surliness . </s> <s> After the abysmal 'lack of ' service at the hotel bar I elected to eat out every other night 'I declined to try the room service ; unimpressed with every other offering so far ' . </s> <s> I would not use this hotel for my business or personal trips . ' </s> 
<s> The Homewood Suites by Hilton ; in downtown Chicago ; has to be one of the most comfortable and affordable hotels in the windy city . </s> <s> After asking the doorman ; I discovered all guest suites in the entire establishment feature a two room layout with a fully equipped kitchen . </s> <s> The full sized refrigerator caused me to do a double take ; as did the stove and LCD televisions . </s> <s> This is definitely the place to have a home away from home while in Chicago . </s> <s> It 's mind blowing that a hotel this extravagant can have rates as low as $40 a night ; which is what I payed when I stayed there in September . </s> <s> The atmosphere was warm and cozy ; and the staff were all very friendly and professional . ' </s> 
<s> On a recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millemmium Park Hotel I was appalled at the service I received at such a supposedly high end hotel . </s> <s> When I arrived I had to wait in the lobby for 15 minutes before someone came to the front desk to check me in . </s> <s> Apparently the desk clerk was on a personal phone call with her boyfriend and just had to know where he was going and who he was with . </s> <s> Finally I was given the key to my non-smoking room away from the vending area . </s> <s> Much to my chagrin my room was right next to the vending area and I heard other guests going back and forth to the ice machine until nearly midnight . </s> <s> And the room was obviously a room for smokers . </s> <s> The blankets on the bed and the pillows reaked of cigarette smoke . </s> <s> I ; of course complained ; but was told that was the only room available as they had booked every room for a conference but I was welcome to check out and go to another hotel . </s> <s> After a fitfull night 's sleep I awoke to children running up and down the hallway . </s> <s> Their parents were no where in sight . </s> <s> My shower was cold and had no pressure . </s> <s> I was given two towels one of which had not been laundered . </s> <s> I could not wait to check out and informed the manager on duty of my complaints and told him I would not be recommending this hotel to anyone and would go online to write my review so anyone interested would see it . </s> <s> I cannot understand how such a highly rated hotel could be so far from the mark . ' </s> 
<s> Allegro Chicago - I stayed in this hotel when I had to visit Chicago for a business meeting . </s> <s> I would say that the hotel can be barely classified as a 'hotel ' . </s> <s> It was more of a building with some lousy attempt to make it look good . </s> <s> The rooms are pretty small and the hotel staff is not at all helping . </s> <s> The valet parking is expensive . </s> <s> Being right in the middle of the city makes the place noisy and also it is surrounded by tall buildings which spoil the view from the hotel . </s> <s> It is not the worst place but there are better places to stay in Chicago for same money . ' </s> 
<s> The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower was horrible . </s> <s> The first tip off that this would be a bad experience is when we had called ahead to make sure it was OK to check in after hours and that a concierge would be available when we arrived only to find out that they didn 't even have a record of our reservation . </s> <s> After much inappropriate arguing ; they found our reservation and we were assured all would be fine . </s> <s> When we checked in we got a dirty room without any working wifi or TV . </s> <s> It took a few calls to get fresh towels and for them to turn the heat on so we could sleep comfortably . </s> <s> The next day we called to get our complimentary room service that most decent hotels provide free and they had no records of us even checking in . </s> <s> A quick check with the credit card company had they charge already pending in the wrong amount . </s> <s> We finally left in disgust and got a much better hotel ; the FancyPants Hotel and Suits with complementary airport shuttle and award winning preferred member rewards club . </s> <s> Overall ; the service at the Sofitel was rude ; rooms were unsatisfactory ; restaurant sub-par ; not well kept up or clean . </s> <s> In the future I would never stay there again and wold definitely pick a more reputable hotel with a proven track record ; like the FancyPants Hotel and suits ; my personal favorite .

<s> I recently visited Chicago . </s> <s> I stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago . </s> <s> First of all I did not enjoy the welcome as i checked in to the hotel . </s> <s> My hotel price was off the roof and i only used it to sleep and eat breakfast . </s> <s> The food served was not up to par I felt like it was a cheap " free " lunch . </s> <s> My room was crowded and my waste baskets did not have bags in them . </s> <s> My toilet paper row was half way finished when I checked in . </s> <s> I felt that the house keepers gave us dirty looks as we went in and out of the room . </s> <s> I did not feel safe ; I had to hide my valuables and I kept the " BUSY " sign on the door so no one would enter and take stuff . </s> <s> The rooms did not appear as they do on their website ; it is actually the opposite . </s> <s> Looked to me like a regular motel inn but I paid way more than I would have at an actual motel inn . </s> <s> I did not appreciate that none of the electrical outlets worked and my phone was dead for my whole duration of the trip . </s> <s> I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone . ' </s> 
<s> I was completely unfamiliar with Chicago but needed a place to stay while my husband worked there for a few days and we picked the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based solely on their internet site . </s> <s> Wow did I get lucky ! </s> <s> This is a beautiful hotel with all of amenities I could have hoped for ; terrific food ; and within walking distance of several interesting places ; including the Art Institute of Chicago . </s> <s> Ashley ; at the concierge desk ; was particularly helpful at guiding a Chicago newbie to the best places to eat ands to see . </s> <s> I will heartily recommend the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers . ' </s> 
<s> I had to go down to Chicago one weekend for the graduation ceremony of my cousin . </s> <s> It was a sudden trip and I didn 't even have the time to book a hotel before hand . </s> <s> When I showed up in Chicago and asked my taxi driver to take me to the nearest good hotel ; he took me to Omni Chicago Hotel . </s> <s> I was impressed with how clean it was and they didn 't have a problem with getting me a room even though I didn 't have a reservation . </s> <s> The staff was friendly to me the entire time I was in the hotel ; which was just a short two nights ; and the cleaning service was top notch . ' </s> 
<s> The Amalfi Hotel has become my absolute favorite place to stay when I visit Chicago . </s> <s> This place really knows how to treat their guests . </s> <s> They serve a complimentary breakfast on every floor and even have iPod docking stations in the room ! </s> <s> If you want to watch a movie you can just borrow it from their collection . </s> <s> I took advantage of the free wi-fi AND the plush bathrobes . </s> <s> While I stayed there I had to try the spa services that were offered . </s> <s> Wonderful experience ! </s> <s> The staff really made me feel comfortable during my stay and I will definitely be staying there again on my next trip to Chicago .

<s> Sofitel Chicago Water Tower - We had a great stay at Sofitel during our family trip to Chicago . </s> <s> The location was simply great . </s> <s> Located in downtown Chicago ; it was very convenient to shops ; restaurants ; and subway stations . </s> <s> The rooms were a good size and very clean . </s> <s> Although it was kind of on the pricey side ; for the location and the comfortable stay ; we really couldn 't complain . </s> <s> I would be happy to return next time I 'm in Chicago !

<s> Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park - Here 's what you don 't want to hear when you walk into a Fairmont hotel at 11 : 00pm after a 10-hour flight : " I 'm sorry ; Ma 'am ; the hotel is overbooked . </s> <s> The only rooms we still have available are in the smoking section . " Because apparently what a confirmed reservation and $300 'night will get you is blank stares and an " I 'm sorry ; Ma 'am ; that 's the best we can do at the moment . " . </s> <s> So I took the room because I was so tired that all I wanted was to sink into a bed and deal with this in the morning . </s> <s> Well ; I should have just gone to a different hotel because not only did the whole floor ; including my room ; reek so bad that I got an immediate headache ; but the room itself was so dingy that I cannot understand how they manage to keep their prices up . </s> <s> The carpet looked so old and gross that I decided to keep my shoes on just to be safe . </s> <s> The furnishings look like they came out of my grandma 's attic . </s> <s> The layout is so weird that every time you go to the bathroom you have to be careful not to walk right into a table corner . </s> <s> The bathroom is small and cramped ; with a perfectly placed mirror to let you stare at yourself while sitting on the toilet . </s> <s> The tap was perfect for having water splashed all over yourself while you 're brushing your teeth . </s> <s> Great for when you want to take a shower ; because the shower itself WAS NOT WORKING ! </s> <s> Huh ; you 'd think this is something SOMEONE would have taken note of ; especially the cleaning staff if they really DID clean the shower after the previous customer ; which I now suspect they hadn 't . </s> <s> I called downstairs and a surly concierge condescended to give me a room where at least the shower worked 'though still in the smoking section ; of course ' . </s> <s> By the time I finally managed to fall asleep it was 4am and the cleaning staff promptly knocked on my door at 8am and waltzed right in ! </s> <s> I was so taken aback with the lack of professionalism 'and common sense !

<s> Oh My ! </s> <s> More Like A Dank Museum Than A Four Star Hotel ! </s> <s> I read so many reviews on this hotel that I was sure my husband and I wouldn 't be disappointed on spending our 10th Wedding Anniversary in the heart of Chicago at such a luxurious hotel ! </s> <s> All the reviews sounded great so I feel awkward writing this ; but I have to be fair - this place was a major disappointment . </s> <s> While the location is superb ; the images online must have been taken over 10 years ago because all of the decor when we visited looked very old and faded . </s> <s> I noticed dirt everywhere - the fabric on the furniture was stained ; the baseboards and woodwork were scratched and dirty and there seemed to be a smell of mold and mildew that permeated the entire hotel . </s> <s> Even though the food was great ; the linens ; glassware and silverware were not sparkling - it sort of helped that candles were lit so I didn 't focus too much on how dreary and washed out the dining facility was . </s> <s> I didn 't realize experiencing history would actually mean staying at a hotel that 's living in the past ! </s> <s> This was barely a two star hotel and I do not recommend staying here at all .

<s> I stayed at the Monaco-Chicago back in April . </s> <s> I was in town on business ; and the hotel was recommended by a friend of mine . </s> <s> Having spent a weekend there ; I have no idea what my friend was talking about . </s> <s> The complimentary morning coffee was weak ; the fitness room was dimly lit ; and I thought I 'd have to have my clothes mailed back to me when I used their supposed " overnight " laundry service for a suit I spilled some wine on . </s> <s> My room was adequate ; but nowhere near what I 've seen elsewhere at this price point . </s> <s> Recent renovation must be slang for " everything is stiff and smells of industrial adhesive .

<s> I recently made a business trip to Chicago ; in which I stayed at the downtown Fairmont hotel . </s> <s> During my visit ; I had an aroma-harmony massage . </s> <s> This experience greatly relieved my stress ; from all the business meetings I 'd had that day . </s> <s> Candace worked wonders for my neck muscles ; especially . </s> <s> This was the only amenity that I sought out ; during my trip . </s> <s> My time was very limited . </s> <s> However ; the entire staff at this hotel treated me as if I were a valued guest . </s> <s> I 'll definately stay at this hotel again when I 'm in the area . </s> <s> And ; I highly recommend the spa !

<s> Intercontinental Chicago - I admit that I was a little hesitant about booking at Intercontinental Chicago in the first place after reading some bad reviews but that 's what makes me share my good experience . </s> <s> I found this place quite comfortable and reasonable as far as price is concerned . </s> <s> I mean you have the view of beautiful Michigan Avenue from your window ; the rooms are recently renovated ; spacious and clean ; the room service is prompt and the best part is the huge pool which my kids loved ! ! </s> <s> I would definitely stay here the next time I visit Chicago .

<s> The James Chicago-This hotel is pretty bad and expensive . </s> <s> I stayed in one of their guest rooms and it was too small to accommodate even one person comfortably . </s> <s> The bed and floors were dirty ; and the shower leaked water everywhere because of a broken pipe . </s> <s> I would not stay at the James again ; especially not at the price .

<s> Oh my goodness ; this has got to be one of the worst places to stay in all of downtown Chicago . </s> <s> It all went well enough checking in ; but them went downhill . </s> <s> There was so much left to be desired . </s> <s> The biggest problem was a huge turd in the toilet ; I kid you not ! </s> <s> I guess the maid was rather busy that day or took a break and forgot about it ; I just don 't know . </s> <s> But for the prices they charge ; this type of thing is unacceptable . </s> <s> Most everything else about the actual room was as expected . </s> <s> The noise was a bit more than I 'm used to though ; but there was a convention of college age kids staying on the floor above us . </s> <s> So we asked to be moved to another room ; they did get us in another room ; but that took nearly 2 hours . </s> <s> The second room worked out well for us ; but I won 't be risking staying here again . </s> <s> Plus the pool was not available ; I really wish they would have mentioned that on their website ; I was looking forward to it for days . </s> <s> All in all ; it is a beautiful place in a wonderful location ; but they need to work on their customer service before I 'll reconsider staying at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown .

<s> James Chicago-A good hotel with friendly and cooperative staff . </s> <s> It is in a prime location near many tourist attractions and restaurants . </s> <s> The room design was modern and welcoming .

<s> WARNING ! </s> <s> My stay at the Talbott Hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels . </s> <s> I was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends . </s> <s> After receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the Talbott . </s> <s> They were promoting up to $30 breakfast credit per day . </s> <s> And breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time . </s> <s> Upon our arrival we were greeted by an employee 'which we wouldn 't have known had he not told us ' that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group . </s> <s> Once we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to King suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved . </s> <s> If someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms I would have sworn we were at Motel 6 ; not a luxury hotel in Chicago . </s> <s> The linens were stained ; room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee . </s> <s> I was truly disgusted . </s> <s> After a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep . </s> <s> The next morning I was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests . </s> <s> I have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever eaten . </s> <s> The toast was stale ; eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs ; and the juice they served was sour . </s> <s> I would never recommend this as a place to stay . </s> <s> I would suggest the Red Roof Inn over this place anytime . ' </s> 
<s> If anyone is traveling to Chicago ; I would strongly recommend the Palmer House Hilton . </s> <s> I have spent two nights in this hotel during a recent business trip and I was impressed by the elegant feel and look of the hotel . </s> <s> I had a guest room with a double bed . </s> <s> At the first sight ; the room had perfect decor . </s> <s> The double bed looked comfy and cozy . </s> <s> It wasn 't just a room because it also came with high speed internet and personalized listening options which were great features for a tired traveler like me . </s> <s> Since I was in a hurry in my two-day stay ; I didn 't have time to wander around the town for food . </s> <s> It wasn 't a problem because the hotel offered a few places to dine or simply for snacks . </s> <s> The good thing is that their bar and lounge opened late at night . </s> <s> I can assure you that they had great quality food and drinks . </s> <s> If you are just touring the city ; the hotel is quite close to parks ; museum ; and a lot of shopping places . </s> <s> If you just need a place to stay ; the view from the hotel was pretty good as well . </s> <s> Among all the hotels I have spent time in ; the Palmer House Hilton tops the list .

<s> Fairmont Chicago ; Millennium Park -- The Fairmont Chicago hotel is quite nice . </s> <s> I was impressed by the amount of sunlight my room received 'my room 's windows faced south ' . </s> <s> A lot of hotels have well decorated rooms but without good lighting the room can still feel off ; but the Fairmont Chicago does not make this mistake . </s> <s> I was disappointed by the provided moisturizer but I have sensitive skin so I brought my own just in case . </s> <s> I liked the proximity of the hotel to the fantastic sushi restaurant down the street . </s> <s> Overall this was quite the comfortable 'and delicious ' stay .

<s> My husband and I recently visited the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel on one of his business trips . </s> <s> I sometimes go along with him to see new places and to splurge on a mini-vacation while he is hard at work 'don 't worry- he likes when I return with little " souvenirs " for him ; too ' . </s> <s> Aside from the lovely city of Chicago ; this hotel was just amazing ! </s> <s> We had gotten in quite late that evening from our flight from Houston and were so tired ! </s> <s> The staff was genuine and friendly ; all while being professional and prompt . </s> <s> We were quickly checked in and before we knew it we were in our beautiful room . </s> <s> Too tired to really take it in ; we were in bed and asleep in minutes . </s> <s> The beds were quite welcoming ! </s> <s> It wasn 't until the next morning that we were able to really take in all of the beautiful features of this hotel ! </s> <s> It 's gorgeous ! </s> <s> Everything was so clean and wonderfully decorated ! </s> <s> The lobby somehow didn 't make it into our sleepy eyes the night before ; but it was just lovely ! </s> <s> Later that evening we decided to eat at their sushi restaurant . </s> <s> Sushi is one of my husband 's favorites ; so he tends to be picky . </s> <s> They passed the test according to him ! </s> <s> We also enjoyed a glass of wine there as well . . . </s> <s> everything tasted great and was of excellent quality . </s> <s> Of our two night stay there ; the only downfall was one occasion of there not being enough towels 'I use a lot of towels I suppose ' . </s> <s> However ; a simple phone called prompted a quick delivery of fluffy additional ones . </s> <s> This however was only a minor bump in the road to an entirely enjoyable and relaxing stay ! </s> <s> Overall-- we 'd love to go there again ! </s> <s> Maybe next time I can talk my husband into taking advantage of the spa . . . </s> <s> 'wink ' '
<s> Hard Rock Chicago - We heard good reviews of this hotel online ; and so when we were going to Chicago for a week ; we decided it would be a nice place to stay . </s> <s> Yes ; the rooms are nice ' ' ' beautiful even ' ' ' but for us it just wasn ' ' 't worth the price . </s> <s> The place was loud ; which we probably should have expected given the theme ; but we were assured it wouldn ' ' 't be an issue . </s> <s> Still we could have gotten by that ; had we been made to feel at home . </s> <s> The staff were cold and unfriendly ; and were often a disaster to deal with . </s> <s> We would ask for stuff to be brought up to our room ; and it would take them close to three hours to finally bring it .

<s> Hotel Allegro - I recently had a business trip in Chicago and unfortunately stayed at the Hotel Allegro . </s> <s> There was a clerk named Marie who was extremely rude at check-in . </s> <s> When I wanted to switch rooms ; because the room did not resemble the room on the website ; they did not accommodate my needs . </s> <s> The room was much smaller than anticipated ; with rumpled sheets and definitely not enough moisturizer . </s> <s> The toilet also clogged very easily . </s> <s> Although the evening wine hour was superb ; it did not make up for the other faults of the hotel ! </s> <s> I would not recommend a stay for any amount of time at Hotel Allegro .

<s> Talbott Hotel - Pricey ; inconvenient and a scam are all words I could use to describe my terrible time at the Talbott Hotel . </s> <s> The service was slow ; and " Greg ; " the concierge goon obviously showed he didn 't want to be there ; a feeling I can empathize with . </s> <s> The room was plenty big but that means nothing when it is untidy and dirty . </s> <s> When I first got there ; the linens were obviously discolored by acts of which I shall not speak . </s> <s> The service was slow in responding ; so I went down to the market restaurant for a drink . </s> <s> The restraunt itself was extremely cramped and the chairs were so close I was basically sticking my nose where it did not belong . </s> <s> The food was mediocre ; the lemon taste was too sour and the ribs were drenched in disgusting barbeque sauce . </s> <s> When my room was finally ready ; I realized how small the room really was . </s> <s> The brown coloring on everything was so drab and boring . </s> <s> The bathroom was suitable for a midget since it was so small . </s> <s> All I can say is do not stay here unless you like bad service ; cramped rooms and terrible food . </s> <s> The loud noises coming from all directions did not help either .

<s> The Hyatt Regency Chicago basically caters to guests who want to feel like they 're staying in a Nice Hotel as soon as they enter the lobby . </s> <s> In other words ; come here for the looks ; not the amenities . </s> <s> They make a big deal out of the fact that their bedsheets undergo a special de-germifying process . . . . </s> <s> you know ; because a simple washing machine just isn 't good enough . </s> <s> To me ; this sort of thing appeals to folks who enjoy being picky and narcissistic because they identify these traits with being " rich " --which most of them are not . </s> <s> Meanwhile ; the hotel doesn 't even offer free wireless--an essential feature for business travelers like me . </s> <s> Obviously I 'm not the intended consumer ; though ; so I guess I shouldn 't be surprised .

<s> When I walked into the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel ; my first thought was ; " wow this is very yellow " ; and not the good kind of yellow like a sunny day ; no the ugly yellow that you would want to wash off your pretty white blouse . </s> <s> my room was fairly descent although the yellow theme seemed to leak in . </s> <s> It was a Victorian feeling in the lobby that turned into a modern feeling in the rooms and bathrooms . </s> <s> i would have liked to see less yellow and maybe a bit more of that fancy feeling from the lobby in the rooms .

<s> My husband and me reserved a room online for the Chicago Hilton . </s> <s> We were looking for a quit few days away from home and work . </s> <s> Unfortunately what we found was not what we were looking for . </s> <s> First of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos . </s> <s> The floors looked like they haven 't been cleaned in a while in the check in area . </s> <s> The room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side . </s> <s> The staff was horrible . </s> <s> We had asked for a turn down service it was never received . </s> <s> I would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone . </s> <s> Chicago is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the Hilton .

<s> At the InterContinental Chicago ; you pay for more than a room . </s> <s> You pay for an experience . </s> <s> Let me elaborate . </s> <s> I was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities . </s> <s> Like any novice traveller to Chicago ; I saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs ; and those were originally what I set my sights on . </s> <s> Price is a powerful signal ; and the sheer discount of those options drew me in . </s> <s> But after doing a bit of research ; I realised that distance does have its costs . </s> <s> The price of transit in the Chicagoland area isn 't free . </s> <s> And it 's far from what I 'm used to . </s> <s> Car use is price prohibitive . </s> <s> 'I knew that originally ; which is why I wasn 't going to drive . ' </s> <s> But the sting of using the automobile 'parking ; congestion ; toll roads ; etc . ' </s> <s> gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental . </s> <s> So ; I ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit . </s> <s> But mass transit has its costs too ; which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages . </s> <s> That 's what originally drew me to InterContinental . </s> <s> But InterContinental is much more than the right room at the right place . </s> <s> The decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable . </s> <s> I was travelling on international business ; so the ease with which I could transact in foreign currency was a draw . </s> <s> 'They had a currency exchange right there on the premises . ' </s> <s> And the fact that massages ; dry cleaning ; and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus . </s> <s> My work gets me tied up in knots . </s> <s> It also leaves little time for doing chores . </s> <s> So the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me . </s> <s> But ; on top of all that ; the event planning was what put InterContinental over the top . </s> <s> Being able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of Chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders--and something I won 't forget . </s> <s> In the end ; if you 're a newcomer to Chicago staying in a time-crunch ; the InterContinental is for you . </s> <s> The pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive ; but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs ; it 's nothing in the end . </s> <s> And the InterContinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options ; it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be . ' </s> 
<s> My husband and I stayed in this hotel for what was supposed to be a romantic weekend . </s> <s> It was far from that ! </s> <s> We could hear the television in the neighboring room and when we called the front desk to complain ; the person who answered the phone was extremely rude ! </s> <s> We were unable to relax at all ! </s> <s> Also ; the room was not very clean ; there was a definite smell of cigarette smoke and the bed was as hard as a rock . </s> <s> We will not be returning to this awful place ! ' </s> 
<s> I recently stayed at The James during a business trip to Chicago and I would certainly recommend it . </s> <s> The hotel is well located in downtown ; only a few blocks from millenium park and other attractions . </s> <s> The room was very nice ; with a soft bed and plenty of windows and natural light . </s> <s> I also had the opportunity to use the Gym ; which was well equipped and had even an instructor which gave me some tips . </s> <s> I wasn 't too impressed by the restaurant though . </s> <s> Food was rather boring and the place very pretentious . </s> <s> Nevertheless ; price was fair for a hotel of its class and staff were helpful and very competent . ' </s> 
<s> Although much too overpriced in my opinion ; the hotel is spotless . </s> <s> The staff was very courteous . </s> <s> And the spa service ? </s> <s> Was a God send ! </s> <s> In a relatively flexible location for traveling for sight seeing so I didnt spend major bucks trying to get around the city ! </s> <s> LOVE IT ! </s> <s> Going back for my anniversary '
<s> The InterContinental Chicago is conveniently located near MIdway airport so the commute was short and easy . </s> <s> The room had a great view of a lake . </s> <s> Room service was available 24 hours a day and the room came with a coffeemaker where you got complimentary coffee and tea which was great I did not have to go out for my morning cup of coffee . </s> <s> There was a business center that had internet ; fax machines ; and copy machines that was available for use 24 hours a day . </s> <s> One of my favorite things was the fitness center which had masseurs ; it was exactly what I needed ; very relaxing . </s> <s> The food at the Eno was some of the best I ever ate especially the chocolate ; I never wanted to leave . </s> <s> This was a great hotel experience and I would stay there again .

<s> The Hotel Monaco Chicago was a great hotel . </s> <s> The rooms were very nice ; great customer service . </s> <s> Every member of the staff was extremely nice . </s> <s> I liked that it was pet friendly ; and you couldn 't even tell they allowed pets . </s> <s> Very clean . </s> <s> Prompt service when requested ; and the food was very tasty ! </s> <s> An A ' in my book ; the prices were very reasonable as well since it is a four star hotel . </s> <s> Very immaculate . </s> <s> Will definitely stay there again the next time I visit Chicago .

<s> My husband and I were planning our 1st year wedding anniversary and we wanted to go back and spend it in Chicago where we had first met . </s> <s> After spending several minutes frustratingly navigating The Talbott Hotel 's website ; I FINALLY was able to complete a reservation for a long weekend . </s> <s> After a long flight into Chicago ; we were so ready to check in ; shower ; and lay down in our hotel room . </s> <s> However ; once we arrived the unfriendly clerk behind the counter notified us that we did not have a reservation . </s> <s> I provided her with the confirmation email and she again said there must be a mistake because the room we reserved was already occupied . </s> <s> She begrudgingly found us a new room after what seemed like an hour of waiting . </s> <s> We then carried our own bags up to our room only to immediately be hit with a rancid smell of cigarette smoke as soon as we opened the door . </s> <s> I 'm severely allergic to smoke and we ended up getting a refund and locating a much more accommodating and friendly hotel . ' </s> 
<s> Pleasant staff and housekeeping . </s> <s> Above average breakfast . </s> <s> The rooms were clean and the staff made sure we had fresh linnens . </s> <s> It was bedbug free ! ! </s> <s> I would definitely stay there again . ' </s>

<s> Eww ! </s> <s> What a sickening affair ; the Hotel Monaco Chicago is a stuffy masterpiece of a hotel done wrong . </s> <s> I stayed there recently and the rooms reek of the pretended elite classes whom fill its rooms . </s> <s> I seriously was afraid to even lie between the sheets for fear of being charged a hefty linens fee . . . </s> <s> I stayed in Chicago for a week ; I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for one night !

<s> My wife and I stayed at the Conrad Chicago Hilton a few weeks back . </s> <s> I had a conference in the Windy City ; and my wife decided she 'd come along to do some shopping . </s> <s> First off let me say ; typically I LOVE staying in hotels - any chance I get ; i 'll spend it away from home in a comfy hotel bed . </s> <s> That said ; this place was terrible . </s> <s> The room had a slight odor to it ; kind of a fishy smell . </s> <s> The people at the front desk were rude to us . </s> <s> And I found a soiled pair of women 's panties under the bed . </s> <s> Gross ! </s> <s> Not to mention that once we got home ; we both had bug bites up and down our legs--- now we 're worried we brought bedbugs home with us ! </s> <s> If I could take this trip back I would . </s> <s> What a terrible place . </s> <s> Shame on you Conrad Hilton ; shame on you !

<s> If you are looking for a true luxury experience ; Hotel Monaco Chicago is not the place to go . </s> <s> I stayed here while visiting friends and decided to treat myself to a luxury experience . </s> <s> I did not get it . </s> <s> Check in was not a pleasant experience . </s> <s> The wait was long and the front desk staff were unfriendly and unhelpful . </s> <s> The room was ok ; no roaches or anything ; but it was small and cramped . </s> <s> And the mirrored headboard on my bed was more tacky motel than fancy hotel . </s> <s> The house cleaning service was really pushy and tried to clean my room at 8 : 30a in the morning . </s> <s> When I asked them to come back later ; they gave me a whole 15 minutes before they came back . </s> <s> And getting extra towels was like pulling teeth . </s> <s> I don 't know if they thought I was going to steal them or what . </s> <s> The room service food that I ordered was fine ; but it took forever to be delivered and was half-cold by the time I received it . </s> <s> When I called the front desk to complain ; they apologized ; but did not offer to compensate me or send me new food . </s> <s> They have a restaurant at the hotel ; but I did not bother to try it . </s> <s> The prices were ridiculous ; the menu was limited ; and my room service experience assured me it was not worth the hassel . </s> <s> I was really disenchanted with this experience . </s> <s> At $400 plus dollars a night ; I received mediocre accomedations and poor service . </s> <s> Spend your hard-earned money somewhere else .

<s> The James Chicago is a stuffy ; uninviting hotel . </s> <s> If you are looking for all of the comforts of home ; do not stay here . </s> <s> The rooms are like boardrooms ; not bedrooms . </s> <s> Definitely not a child-friendly hotel . </s> <s> The restaurant on site is also very modern and screams pretentious . </s> <s> I would not vacation here again ; especially not with children . </s> <s> They were afraid to touch anything in the whole hotel !

<s> I stayed at the Omni hotel with my family on vacation in Chicago . </s> <s> There was a long queue at the front desk for checking in . </s> <s> After we finally got the room ; we were sad to see that the room was not clean . </s> <s> The items in the mini bar were very costly . </s> <s> We had a problem with the shower and calling the room service did not help . </s> <s> The beds were comfortable to sleep and the view of downtown from the room was great at night . </s> <s> Kids enjoyed the pool . </s> <s> The food at the restaurant was not so good and the service was bad . </s> <s> Overall ; the hotel did not live up to our expectations and somewhat ruined our vacation .

<s> The hotel was not one of the better ones I stayed at . </s> <s> the room was seemingly nice at first ; but after staying there for a few days it seemed like the cleaning staff never came through to clean it . </s> <s> I had the same sheets for a three days before I called and requested they be changed . </s> <s> Also ; the walls seem to be paper thin and you can hear what is going on in the adjacent rooms ; which interfered with my sleep . </s> <s> I ate at the primehouse in the restaurant also ; and asked for a well done steak ; and the steak was still pretty pink on the inside and lacked flavor . </s> <s> This is definitely not a hotel I would recommend to anyone .

<s> I enjoyed my stay at the Talbott Hotel . </s> <s> It is on the more expensive side ; but it is all worth it . </s> <s> I got the Talbott tradition package ; which was $245 for two people and included a $30 breakfast credit on check out day . </s> <s> The rooms are huge ! </s> <s> The beds are soft and comfortable . </s> <s> They include Aveda bath products ; which is a plus in my book . </s> <s> They also have a nice fitness area ' pool you can use while you stay there . </s> <s> One thing I thought was really cool is that you can forward your messages from your hotel room phone to your cell phone . </s> <s> My boyfriend also liked the Ihome audio system . </s> <s> The location of this hotel is very convenient as well ; its close to several great restaurants and blocks from the coast . </s> <s> But ; what I like best about this hotel is that they make an honest effort to not negatively impact the environment more than they need to . </s> <s> They were one of the first hotels to be Green Sealed . </s> <s> Overall I had a great stay at Talbott Hotel !

<s> We enjoyed our stay at the James in Chicago very much . </s> <s> The hotel is elegant and uber-modern ! </s> <s> Each room simply exudes class . </s> <s> I have never stayed in a nicer hotel ; to be honest . </s> <s> The hotel features an upscale restaurant ; though it is within walking distance of many great dining establishments . </s> <s> There is also a full-service spa at the hotel . </s> <s> The most surprising thing about the James is that pets are allowed ; our dog didn 't have to stay at home . </s> <s> How cool is that ? </s> <s> There are also lots of up-scale amenities like valet parking ; 24-hour room service ; 24-hour concierge ; shoe shine service ; and laundry 'dry cleaning . </s> <s> The hotel is located right on the Magnificent Mile ; so that location is absolutely superb . </s> <s> You are literally steps away from some of the best dining and shopping in the world . </s> <s> I would recommend the James to anyone on business or looking to stay in upscale luxury on a jaunt to Chicago .

<s> This hotel was not at all what I expected it would be . </s> <s> The website and it 's pictures portray the hotel in a much better condition than it is actually in . </s> <s> The amenities were not what I was looking for ; and the price of the hotel was not a good value for what was offered there . </s> <s> My AAA membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels . </s> <s> The staff was not very friendly or helpful when I had questions about the area ; and they were not very prompt when responding to requests . </s> <s> I understand that there were a lot of guests staying there while I was there ; but they need to have more staff on hand if they cannot provide their hotel guests with quality service . </s> <s> I don 't think I will be staying at this hotel again anytime soon .

<s> Just what I needed at James : I can 't tell you how impressed I was with my stay at the James Chicago Hotel . </s> <s> I came into town for a week long business conference and was referred to the James by a friend . </s> <s> The crisp ; clean ; contemporary ambiance made me feel like I was on a relaxed vacation rather than work . </s> <s> It was luxury without being over the top . </s> <s> My room was clean ; comfortable and was above all standards comfortable . </s> <s> In my down time I enjoyed a relaxing massage at the spa and happy hour at the " JBar " ; and I highly recommend dinner at the " David Burke Primehouse " The customer service from all the staff members ; from front desk ; to house keeping to the bartender was excellent . </s> <s> I plan on returning on my spring vist and look forward to another phenomenal experience .

<s> The Hotel Monaco is a hotel that some say has " character " . </s> <s> I found the decor tacky and had a hard time relaxing in the room designed with clashing colors and " contemporary furniture " . </s> <s> I found the fact that you have to be a member of the Kimpton rewards club to get free wi-fi access to be annoying at the least . </s> <s> Because of their pet-friendly policy ; our room smelled like a wet dog ; and a canine " guest " down the hall kept us up all night with his howling . </s> <s> Perhaps the dog would have howled less if the 24-hour room service were faster . </s> <s> We waited an hour and a half for our order : meaning we did not get our dinner we wanted at 10 : 00 pm until midnight ! </s> <s> All in all ; we would not stay here again . </s> <s> The views and location are great ; but for the money there are better places to stay in Chicago .

<s> Sheraton Chicago Hotel ' Towers - My stay at this hotel was awful . </s> <s> This was my first visit to Chicago and I was really excited about it ; but staying at Sheraton ruined it . </s> <s> My boyfriend and I had to wait for 4 hours to check into our room ; and it was surprisingly small and dirty . </s> <s> You would not expect a room so small and dirty at such a high price ! </s> <s> We then requested to change a room and it took the staff another 3 hours to get it done . </s> <s> We were satisfied with the condition of our second room and then decided to go to the pool ; and we were so disappointed . </s> <s> There were no one at the pool ; and the staff knew so little about their hotel that we asked three people to finally get there ! </s> <s> The only thing that one cannot pick is the location of this hotel . </s> <s> It is right at downtown Chicago and very easy to go to everywhere . </s> <s> Other than that ; I did not find anything in this hotel that worth the price it charged . </s> <s> I would not recommend this hotel to any friend and I would certainly not stay there again .

<s> The James Chicago - Though the hotel was at a great location ; the rooms were very small and I could hear normal talks in the adjacent rooms . </s> <s> I had to figure out myself how to connect to the wireless internet connection and only to know that the speed was very slow and the range itself was not good . </s> <s> The breakfast was not worth the money . </s> <s> I would never go there again . ' </s> 
<s> The Sheraton Chicago is not the place to be if you want to experience Chicago . </s> <s> There are no customer services to provide you with ideas of what to do ; and there aren 't even any shuttles that will bring you around town . </s> <s> The food in the restaurant at the Hotel serves mediocre burgers and fries ; and makes no attempt to emulate the Chicago culture . </s> <s> There are a million other hotels in Chicago ; and this is one of the most average . </s> <s> The rooms are fairly decent sized ; but they lack amenities like wi-fi and mini bars . </s> <s> The view is nothing special ; and the concierge is anything but responsive to phone calls .

<s> Conrad Chicago ' ' ' Having read the reviews ; I had very high expectations for this hotel ; but it was mediocre at best . </s> <s> The location is very good indeed 'one block from Mag Mile ' ; but that 's it . </s> <s> I booked a room with " a view " and as it turned out ; the " view " was of the building next to the hotel ; no joke ! </s> <s> Besides that ; the TV wasn 't working ; so I called the manager and their solution was to " downgrade " me to another room . </s> <s> Frankly it was better to move to a cheaper room ; because " the view " was clearly not worth paying for ; but still ; it was a very poor handling of the situation . </s> <s> Both rooms were large and clean and the bathroom was OK ; but there was so much noise from the street that I actually had a hard time trying to sleep . </s> <s> Breakfast was largely overpriced 'I spent around $30 ' and so was parking . </s> <s> Staff was cold most of the time and the manager didn 't even apologize for the room change . </s> <s> Frankly for the price they charge I expected much more . </s> <s> Next time I go to Chicago ; I will look for other hotels where I can get more from my money .

<s> Fairmont - I was not impressed with this hotel . </s> <s> I have stayed at other hotels in the Chicago area in the past and Fairmont Chicago pales in comparison to those . </s> <s> Upon checking in ; I noticed that the room had not been cleaned and only the bed was made . </s> <s> Also ; the tables had cigarette burns on it . </s> <s> Upon inspecting the bathroom ; I found out that the bathroom doors did not close properly . </s> <s> When I tried to get some work done ; I had trouble with the spotty wi-fi because I kept getting disconnecting after every few minutes . </s> <s> While the bed was comfortable ; I could not get much sleep due to the street-level noise of vehicles and people . </s> <s> I would not recommend this hotel at all and will definitely stay at another hotel the next time I 'm in Chicago .

<s> My wife and I live in the Western Suburbs of Chicago . </s> <s> For our anniversary ; we booked a night at the Fairmont based on recommendations from friends . </s> <s> While the staff of the hotel was quite friendly and helpful and the location ideal for a night out in the city ; the accommodations themselves were not up to our expectations . </s> <s> For starters ; we requested a non-smoking room which we did receive . </s> <s> However ; the hallway leading up to our room had a distinctive smell of smoke which certainly was a turn off for both of us . </s> <s> While the room was certainly adequate ; the bathroom light had a distinct flicker and there was no complementary shampoo included . </s> <s> While the latter may seem like a minor offense ; it is not what one expects from hotel of such reported quality . </s> <s> Finally ; the cost of parking seemed to be somewhat inflated even for Chicago 's standards . </s> <s> In summary ; the Fairmont is a decent quality hotel but for the price ; I am sure we could of done better .

<s> I stayed two nights at the Hilton Chicago . </s> <s> That was the last time I will be staying there . </s> <s> When I arrived ; I could not believe that the hotel did not offer free parking . </s> <s> They wanted at least $10 . </s> <s> What am I paying for when I stay there for the night ? </s> <s> The website also touted the clean linens . </s> <s> The room was clean and I believe the linens were clean . </s> <s> The problem was with all of the down pillows etc . </s> <s> Don 't they know that people have allergies ? </s> <s> I also later found out that this hotel allows pets . </s> <s> I think that this was another part of my symptoms . </s> <s> If you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks I suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay . </s> <s> I did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking . </s> <s> Beware hidden costs . </s> <s> I will try somewhere else in the future . </s> <s> Not worth the money or the sneezing all night .

<s> My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for three nights last month . </s> <s> We were celebrating our anniversary ; so we decided to splurge on the Prestige Suite . </s> <s> According to the website ; we were to be given either a city or park view ; neither of which we had . </s> <s> Instead ; our room was overlooking a dirty field with some sparse trees . </s> <s> The woman who checked us into our room was rude and impatient ; and the man who helped with our bags was the same . </s> <s> When we got to the room ; the beds were unkempt and the floors were in serious need of a vacuuming . </s> <s> The bathroom was dirty and there was dried toothpaste in the sink . </s> <s> My husband requested that we be given another room ; preferably a clean one ; but the clerk told us that there were no other rooms available . </s> <s> If given the chance ; I would not stay at this hotel again ; even if I were offered a free night . ' </s> 
<s> I really loved my stay at the Talbott . </s> <s> My room was amazing ! </s> <s> The bathroom 'and I am VERY picky about hotel bathrooms ' had ample room for all of my stuff ; which is a bonus for me . </s> <s> The staff treated me really well and they were very friendly . </s> <s> I was afraid that I 'd get a little lost ; since it was my first trip to Chicago ; but the staff helped me navigate to the downtown area 'Rush St . ' </s> <s> Michigan Ave . -- which are 'very ' close by ' . </s> <s> The hotel reminded me of those I 'd stayed at in Europe . </s> <s> The room service is 24 hours ; which for me ; was a bonus because I am up mostly during the nights . </s> <s> This is the 'only ' place I will ever stay if I visit Chicago again . </s> <s> For a single woman traveling alone to a strange city ; this hotel made me feel very safe and comfortable . ' </s> 
<s> What a gorgeous hotel ! </s> <s> From the moment we stepped inside the warm colors of the lobby made us feel welcome at the Sheraton and in Chicago . </s> <s> The heavenly beds made the view from our room that much better ; and to top it off with great restaurants ; you couldn 't ask a hotel for more ! </s> <s> Starbucks coffee in the rooms were just an extra touch that guarantees we 'll be back every time we visit Chicago . ' </s> 
<s> I just got back from the Monaco in Chicago ! </s> <s> I was very pleasantly surprised ; as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway ; and he usually picks bad places-haha . </s> <s> Anyway ; the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated . </s> <s> It was busy and the line was a little long ; but it moved quickly . </s> <s> The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good ; especially since it seemed to be near full . </s> <s> The room was clean and spacious 'especially considering it 's a city hotel ' . </s> <s> We made a lot of use of the concierge ; since again ; it was so last minute we didn 't really make any plans . </s> <s> He gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy ! </s> <s> It was also great being near the theater district ; and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare . </s> <s> I thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room ! </s> <s> very trendy . </s> <s> My husband is not as easily impressed ; but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon . </s> <s> Overall ; really nice stay in a four star ; or probably four and half star hotel ! ' </s> 
<s> This hotel was incredible ! </s> <s> Haven 't had a better stay in a hotel in my life . </s> <s> I will definitely come here again next time I am in Chicago ! </s> <s> The rooms were so elegant ; with their modern color schemes . </s> <s> The staff members were friendly and willing to lend a hand . </s> <s> The beds were surprisingly comfortable ; with interesting covers . </s> <s> The TVs were HD ; which was a step up from most hotels i have stayed at before . </s> <s> There was a cool martini bar that I spent an hour at one night ; which was enjoyable ; especially because of the live jazz band '

<s> First off ; don 't get a room on a lower floor ; the garbage pick up makes a ton of noise and wakes you up at 6 am . </s> <s> Then don 't bother going down for breakfast at that time either ; because the restaurant isn 't open that early . </s> <s> When it finally opened ; the breakfast arrived cold and late . </s> <s> Nothing like congealed eggs to start your day . </s> <s> The fitness center had no towels and no cups for water . </s> <s> It was also too hot and too many people had sweated too much in it . </s> <s> After my congealed breakfast ; it really was not pleasant . </s> <s> My entire three day visit was like that . </s> <s> I tried room service that night ; but again ; service was very slow and the food not warm when it arrived . </s> <s> My high speed internet was not so high speed when it would connect me at all . </s> <s> The furniture was run down and worn . </s> <s> Pool towels were not always available . </s> <s> Generally ; for the price I paid ; I would expect better service and a better maintained premises .

<s> Chicago has many wonderful luxury hotels for tourists and business travelers . </s> <s> When visiting the Windy City ; however ; the Conrad Hotel and Resort is one to avoid . </s> <s> While the description promises clean accommodations ; luxury amenities ; and " deep soaking tubs ; " in relity ; the rooms fall short of expectations . </s> <s> I opened the door to my suite to find a musty smell in the room similar to that of an old neglected closet . </s> <s> A bit disappointed ; I decided to ignore this fact . </s> <s> Hoping to take a nice long soak after my travels ; I made my way to the bathroom . </s> <s> While I did find a large ; deep bathtub ; there was a hard water stain giving it a dingy look . </s> <s> Hardly what I expected for the price I paid for the accommodations . </s> <s> In the corner of the bathroom ; I found a reminder of a pevious guest ; a clump of blond hair . </s> <s> The maid service seemed to be lacking . </s> <s> Not to be deterred from enjoying my stay ; I decided to watch television on the 42 inch flat screen I had been promised . </s> <s> Unfortunately ; the battery to the remote control was dead . </s> <s> I called the front desk ; at my wits ' end ; to complain about the issues ; but was greeted by a desk clerk with a very sassy attitude who seemed to doubt my every word . </s> <s> Overall ; I would definitely not recommend the Conrad Hotel and Resort in Chicago . </s> <s> My room was dirty ; the staff was unfriendly ; and the ammenities were few and far between . </s> <s> On my next stay in Chicago ; I will definitely stay elsewhere . ' </s> 
<s> Conrad Chicago ; " This hotel has a mediocre service . </s> <s> We ordered for room service and it arrived very late and there wasn ' ' 't an apology also . </s> <s> The room had no coffee maker and we had to make a trip to the restaurant to have coffee or tea . </s> <s> The Internet service was free but it didn ' ' 't make any difference as it was so slow that I used my personal internet dongle to browse the web . </s> <s> I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . " '
<s> My husband and I recently stayed at the Conrad Chicago for three nights ; a Thursday through Saturday . </s> <s> Let me say we were less than pleased with our experience . </s> <s> We chose to stay in the " King Bed Deluxe Room " and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations . </s> <s> Upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly ; the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser . </s> <s> The room was size was average ; and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room . </s> <s> The major annoyance was how loud people were . </s> <s> We came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running . </s> <s> That is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel . </s> <s> You can expect a loud guest maybe once ; but every night is ridiculous . </s> <s> The service was also extremely sub par . </s> <s> We had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work . </s> <s> One day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me . </s> <s> She completely disregarded the sign ; did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in . </s> <s> It scared me and I 'm just glad I was not getting out of the shower or changing . </s> <s> So to sum up ; we will never stay at the Conrad again ; we will never recommend it to anyone else ; and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in Chicago .

<s> I would like to add a comment ; maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination . </s> <s> My daughter was married in May of 2010 and we decided to have the special event at the Sofitel Water Tower ; we were amazed . </s> <s> She always wanted a ballroom type of wedding ; and Sofitel made this happen for her . </s> <s> They took care of all the invitations ; cake decor ; and so much more . </s> <s> The special day for my daughter was worth everything . </s> <s> If you are going to be in the Chicago area ; check them out ; you will not regret it ! ' </s> 
<s> I had an awful experience here . </s> <s> The staff were rude and unhelpful . </s> <s> It took forever to check in and when I did ; they took a while to even find my reservation . </s> <s> When I got to the room ; it was marginally clean and when I complained ; they said they were full and could not do anything for me . </s> <s> I would never go back . </s> <s> They are obviously not worried about customer service . ' </s> 
<s> This hotel was very overpriced for what you get from staying here . </s> <s> The Amalfi Hotel Chicago advertises itself as a " luxury hotel " located in downtown Chicago . </s> <s> Since it is in downtown Chicago ; that means that I had street noises keeping me up most of the night . </s> <s> My view also suffered . </s> <s> They had nicer rooms available with better views ; but the markups to stay in them was outrageous ! </s> <s> The room itself was decent ; with clean linens and nice air conditioning ; but I can get that in just about any hotel these days . </s> <s> There wasn 't anything particularly luxurious about the hotel to make it a stand-out for me ; but for the price I paid for the room ; I certainly had that expectation . </s> <s> It was a let down . ' </s> 
<s> Affinia Chicago is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at . </s> <s> Not in my life have I been treated so poorly as a guest . </s> <s> The front desk was very unaccommodating when I asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation . </s> <s> There was no bellhop available for some strange reason so I had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself . </s> <s> If it wasn 't already a bad stay ; I ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered . </s> <s> If they didn 't have air conditioning in the room ; I would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable . </s> <s> If you are traveling to Chicago for any kind of business ; I hope you decide not to choose this hotel . </s> <s> I was quite surprised ; I like Chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience .

<s> Palmer House A Hilton Hotel ' I was hesitant at first to book a room at the Palmer House ; but I decided to give it a try . </s> <s> Though it was a high class hotel ; I did not find my stay to be worth the price I paid . </s> <s> My room was not much better than any other average hotel I have stayed at before . </s> <s> It was a pretty small room especially given the high cost . </s> <s> The food served at the Lockwood Restaurant was nothing special . </s> <s> Also ; I thought it was outrageous that I had to make a reservation in order to go to the bar ; especially since I am a paying guest at the hotel . </s> <s> In the end ; I thought the Palmer House is a nice hotel but definitely not worth the amount of money I paid for my stay .

<s> I recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago with my wife . </s> <s> I was on business but I thought I 'd take her so we could see the city as well . </s> <s> Chicago was great ; The Allegro . . . not so much . </s> <s> I mean it looked nice ; great lobby and all . </s> <s> The service wasn 't so great though . </s> <s> The clerk was a younger girl who seemed a bit rude . </s> <s> Like we were bothering her and interrupting her day by wanting to book a weekend . </s> <s> The bell hop took our bags to our room ; none to gently . </s> <s> My wife and I watched as he threw our luggage on the floor in our room . </s> <s> Which wasn 't that bad till he actually asked for a tip ! </s> <s> Our room was okay . </s> <s> The bed was sort of rough and made a odd plastic rubbing noise every time you moved . </s> <s> The next day my wife went out and returned to find our room wasn 't cleaned . </s> <s> Our trip to the Chicago had it 's nice moments ; all outside the hotel . </s> <s> The Hotel Allegro seemed like they spent too much on the appearance and neglected to staff it better . </s> <s> I won 't stay there again .

<s> This hotel is overpriced . </s> <s> One should pay money for luxury ; but they fall far short considering the prices that they charge . </s> <s> When you go to the hotel restaurants you expect a certain mark-up because ; yes ; they do have to make money . </s> <s> But the prices they charge for food that was okay makes little sense to me . </s> <s> When I got there and went to my room ; I thought that there would be nice colors ; a great view ; and deluxe bedding . </s> <s> What I got were sheets that might have come from the full price section of target--they were not cheap ; but not that expensive either . </s> <s> I think I could have found something of this quality at less than the 200ish a night I paid .

<s> My husband and I stayed in the Hilton Chicago and had a very nice stay ! </s> <s> The rooms were large and comfortable . </s> <s> The view of Lake Michigan from our room was gorgeous . </s> <s> Room service was really good and quick ; eating in the room looking at that view ; awesome ! </s> <s> The pool was really nice but we didnt get a chance to use it . </s> <s> Great location for all of the downtown Chicago attractions such as theaters and museums . </s> <s> Very friendly staff and knowledgable ; you cant go wrong staying here .

<s> Stayed here for two nights and really enjoyed the stay . </s> <s> The cost was a little bit more than I usually care to spend ; but turned out to be a great value . </s> <s> Location was walking distance to restaurants and the subway . </s> <s> Really close to the Miracle Mile and Millennium Park . </s> <s> Room was large ; cozy ; and beautiful- especially loved the window seats with a great view of the river . </s> <s> Complementary wine hour and a goldfish in the room made this a special experience !

<s> When I arrived at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I was shocked at the poor and dangerous neighborhood it was situated in . </s> <s> This was not the Chicago I was hoping for . In addition to that ; it looked nothing like it did in the pictures on their website . </s> <s> The paint was faded and chipped ; there was a foul odor in the lobby and there was no staff to speak of . </s> <s> After we waited for 15 minutes at the front desk ; someone finally came and said that they did not have a reservation under our name . </s> <s> After a long trip ; I 'm sure you know how aggravating that was . </s> <s> Finally I got a manager that knew how to work the computer properly and he brought up our reservation . </s> <s> Once we got to our room ; it was very small ; smelled like smoke and the carpet was severely stained with either wine or blood . </s> <s> Also ; as we were walking to the room in the hallway ; a cockroach walked right across our path like he owned the place . </s> <s> To top it off it seemed everyone staying at the hotel was a gangster or a gambler and his lady for the night . </s> <s> All we heard was lots of frighteningly loud love making and arguments ensuing that even a television could not mask . </s> <s> It was a nightmare . </s> <s> Oh yeah ; and the shower did have any hot water . </s> <s> We complained to the desk and they said that it was not there fault and that it would be fixed my next week . </s> <s> When we asked for a discount they said that there were no refunds and that we could leave whenever we wanted . ' </s> 
<s> Let me just preface this by saying that I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel . </s> <s> I chose it largely for location as I don 't really love to walk that much and I was incredibly pleased with its situation in the city . </s> <s> It was just a couple blocks away from several museums and shopping districts but my husband and I mainly ventured out for food ; of which there were great options and the concierge was a great help . </s> <s> We had originally booked the King Guestroom but upon arrival were upgraded to the Deluxe King Guestroom by the front desk . </s> <s> Everyone was remarkably friendly and helpful which is something I look for and remember when I go to stay in a location again . </s> <s> Our room was amazing . </s> <s> Seriously amazing . </s> <s> It was so chic and I just loved the headboard over our bed . </s> <s> There wasn 't one little spot of dust to be found . </s> <s> The bathroom was gorgeous and we made full use of the two bathrobes in the closet . </s> <s> We didn 't take anything from the snack bar but it all looked delicious . </s> <s> We had dinner at David Burke 's Primehouse . </s> <s> I cannot recommend the NY Ribeye more highly . </s> <s> It was fantastic . </s> <s> For dessert we had the brown butter corn cake . </s> <s> I 've been trying to replicate that dish ever since I got home . </s> <s> I 'm sad to say that I didn 't get a chance to try any of the treatments at Spa by Asha but I definitely will make a point to on my return visit . </s> <s> The James Chicago made our trip to Chicago memorable . </s> <s> The staff was friendly ; the hotel beautiful ; and the food delicious . </s> <s> What more could you want ?

<s> The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a nice place to stay if you need a place to stay on quick notice ; but it certainly does not " exceed expectations " as touted on their website . </s> <s> Their Starpoints system is somewhat complicated and not helpful for the frequent traveler . </s> <s> " Chic but not fussy " is an overstatement . </s> <s> The room was clean ; although the bed covering was wrinkled and the bathroom counter had water lying on it that appeared as though it hadn 't been cleaned since the last guest . </s> <s> There was hand lotion and shampoo samples ; but no soap sample . </s> <s> The bathroom was short on two towels and it took two calls to housekeeping to get this fixed . </s> <s> " Cheap " might have been a better adjective . </s> <s> Check out was simple and not much hassle . </s> <s> Overall ; the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is fine in a pinch ; but next time ; I will research hotels a little better before making a decision and reserving a room .

<s> The Palmer House Hlton Hotel has to be the nicest hotel I have stayed at in Chicago . </s> <s> I went to Chicago on a business trip for a meeting . </s> <s> When I arrived once I walked in ; the lobby was beautiful ; I couldn 't hardly wait to see my room . </s> <s> The rooms were just as nice ; the bathroom was immaculate ! </s> <s> We had a meeting in the Clark Meeting Room ; even that was nice ! </s> <s> I wanted to take a tour of the hotel itself ! </s> <s> I was there for about 3 days and because of how convenient the hotel was to a lot of major attractions like ; Grant Park ; Lake Michigan ; Mag Mile which is a shopping heaven ; and the Navy Pier ; it never really like the normal stressed out meetings . </s> <s> I love Chicago and I now have a new favorite hotel to stay at while I 'm in town .

<s> Hard Rock Hotel Chicago - Location ; location ; location . </s> <s> Shopping ; restaurants ; and Chicago attractions didn 't require driving to get to . </s> <s> The room was well maintained and had nice furniture . </s> <s> I really liked my comfy king sized bed and cushy pillows . </s> <s> Friendly staff and nice amenities were also plus . </s> <s> I would stay at this hotel again .

<s> After arriving at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel I was greeted with rudeness and snubery . </s> <s> My room reservations had been double booked ; and instead of the suite I expected ; I was given a much smaller guest room . </s> <s> Instead of having a concierge I had cockroaches . </s> <s> The dining left me wishing for fast food . </s> <s> The bar left a bad taste in my mouth with the cheap liquor and hot beer .

<s> I was not pleased with my recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton . </s> <s> My room was not ready upon my arrival and the room I was given was not what I had requested . </s> <s> I had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that . </s> <s> The air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off . </s> <s> The room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up . </s> <s> I wondered what had happened in the room before I got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener . </s> <s> There was no doorman available or a cart so I had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items . </s> <s> Luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance . </s> <s> My room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff . </s> <s> They promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk I finally gave up . </s> <s> I had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that I spent to stay there .

<s> If you are looking for a high end hotel on the Magnificent Mile ; the Affinia Chicago is NOT your best option . </s> <s> First of all ; the " central " location is not so convenient - there is quite a hike to the Navy Pier 'which this hotel claims to be the " official " hotel of ' and to the shops on the Mile . </s> <s> Secondly ; the hotel is small - only 215 rooms ; most of which are miniscule by comparison to the other hotels in the area . </s> <s> Thirdly ; they have one restaurant and one lounge ; both of which offer the same menu which seems a bit bizarre for a high end hotel . </s> <s> Finally the Affinia has one of the most rude staffs ever witnessed in a luxury hotel . </s> <s> One does expect some courtesy at the outrageous prices but be ready for the attitude and snobbery that will greet you at the Affinia !

<s> Last week ; I booked a 'Deluxe Suite ' at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago . </s> <s> I took the 'Retreat and Relax ' package deal . </s> <s> The wait to check in was intolerably long ; because they were letting some people check in with a dog . </s> <s> I 'm allergic to dogs ; and I 'm sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in . </s> <s> They insisted on escorting me to to my room ; every time I came in ; like I was going to break into another guest 's room or something . </s> <s> I swear ; anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks ; asking me if I needed anything . </s> <s> You know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you 're up to something . </s> <s> I went to the pool ; but it was full of screaming children . </s> <s> When I went to bed ; I could hear the television in the next room through my wall . </s> <s> And what 's worse ; they wouldn 't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress . </s> <s> They threatened to throw me out on the street ; after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars ! </s> <s> I had to go outside-- probably where the dog went to piddle-- to do it . </s> <s> Also ; their on-site restaurant is too expensive ; given that you 're already paying an arm and a leg for the room . </s> <s> The food should be free ! </s> <s> I wouldn 't stay here again ; it was a waste of my money . ' </s> 
<s> Omni Chicago Hotel ' Stayed here for a 2 nights while attending a business-related conference . </s> <s> Room and bathroom were clean ' spacious and contained all the usual amenities ; though my room surprisingly lacked a coffee machine . </s> <s> Free wifi was provided : a necessity for any business traveller planning to catch up on some work . </s> <s> The continental breakfast had a wide selection of options ; from fresh fruit and cereal to hot scrambled eggs and bacon -- one of the best free breakfast options I have seen in a hotel . </s> <s> Would definitely stay here again .

<s> Palmer House a Hilton Hotel - Here 's a PSA : if you enjoy peace and quiet ; do NOT stay at the Chicago Hilton . </s> <s> Going in ; I didn 't know the place allowed pets ; and I got stuck next to a family that had brought their dog . </s> <s> Forget street noise - I couldn 't hear the cars over all the barking . </s> <s> I complained ; but management said all their basic rooms were full so I 'd have to pay for an upgrade to a suite if I wanted to move . </s> <s> The bed was comfortable enough ; but there were some stains on the comforter when I got there . </s> <s> At least management didn 't try to charge me to fix THAT issue . </s> <s> The pillows were a bit over-plump as well . </s> <s> As for location ; there are some tourist spots nearby ; but some of the places I wanted to see were a decent distance away . </s> <s> The zoo and the Museum of Science are too far to walk to ; so if you want to check those places out ; you 'll have to bring your car and pay the hotel 's sky-high parking prices ; pay for a taxi ; or figure out Chicago 's public transportation system . </s> <s> Bit of a hassle ; really . </s> <s> On the plus side ; the hotel definitely impressed in the looks department : my room was nicely decorated and the hotel 's ballrooms were gorgeous . </s> <s> When it comes down to it ; though ; in the future ; I 'd just rather spend my money on a comfortable room in a convenient location ; rather than a pretty ; " landmark " tourist trap . ' </s> 
<s> This hotel was wonderful . </s> <s> My room was clean and the staff was courteous . </s> <s> The food provided by the restaurant was exceptional . </s> <s> This was on of the best hotel stays ; ive experienced . </s> <s> I highly suggest this hotel to others . ' </s> 
<s> Although the Architecture of the hotel is quaint ; that is about the only positive of this terible hotel . </s> <s> The guest services were unhelpful at best ; and the inbuilding resturaunts were unsanitary and untasteful . </s> <s> And as for the rooms ; small ; cramped ; and it seemed as if the sheets hadn 't been cleaned in the last 5 years . </s> <s> My stay here was distasteful ; and I never intend to return ; except to ask for my money back . ' </s> 
<s> Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago - I stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights several weeks ago . </s> <s> Overall ; it was a very comfortable experience for me . </s> <s> The staff at the front desk were very courteous . </s> <s> They were able to upgrade me from a standard room to one of their junior suites ; which was a pleasant surprise . </s> <s> Instead of just a single room ; there was an elegant sitting area sectioned off by a half-wall to the right of the bed ; which helped the area feel spacious . </s> <s> To the left of the bed was an AMAZING bathroom ; I loved the rainshower system ! </s> <s> Very relaxing . </s> <s> Housekeeping did an outstanding job keeping my room clean ; and room service was very prompt . </s> <s> My only dislike about the place is that they charge for wireless internet access ; but that is standard for high-end hotels like the Millennium Knickerbocker . ' </s> 
<s> After a one night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I must say that while I loved Chicago I will never go back to this hotel . </s> <s> The problems started in the parking lot ; yup before I even got in . </s> <s> There was very little parking available and the area was filled with garbage ; broken glass and kids hanging out looking for trouble . </s> <s> Upon first entrance the hotel seemed nice but all that changed as we got into the elevator to go up to the room . </s> <s> The elevator made all kinds of noise and the door slammed shut on my arm as I was trying to get the bags out . </s> <s> The hall smelled of smoke and the carpets were warn and dirty looking . </s> <s> When in the room we found that one of the curtains would not pull closed ; the heater whistled and when I called the front desk to ask for assistance and fresh pillows I was hung up on . </s> <s> This was only the beginning of our terrible stay . </s> <s> Guests where in the hall and banging on walls all night long . </s> <s> The maids started running vacuums before 8 am and seemed to feel that the best way to do it was by hitting the vacuum on the wall with each pass . </s> <s> We could not check out soon enough ! </s> <s> We called around and found another hotel to stay in for the remainder of our trip . ' </s> 
<s> Hard Rock Hotel - I spent two nights at the Hard Rock Hotel during the week of Thanksgiving ; and to be honest ; it did not meet my expectations . </s> <s> The pictures online made the rooms look huge ; but when I arrived ; my room was no bigger than your average 4-star hotel room . </s> <s> The bathroom was clean ; but again average ; there was no luxury shower ; the toilet was cramped up against the end of the sink vanity ; and the sink itself was fairly shallow . </s> <s> The hotel is in a nice location ; but even on a Thursday night the streets below will boast noise loud enough to keep you awake . </s> <s> Anyway ; it 's not a bad hotel ; but it 's not as exciting as you would guess . ' </s> 
<s> Hyatt Regency Chicago - When I first arrived at the Hyatt Regency I was concerned because of the size of my room ; but I was happily surprised . </s> <s> There was more than enough space . </s> <s> The beds were comfortable ; and the location in the center of Chicago is amazing . </s> <s> For only $150 a night ; this was a real steal . ' </s> 
<s> The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels I have stayed at in a while . </s> <s> At almost $500 a night ; one would expect . </s> <s> Traveling with my wife ; I expected to pay the cost of the room ; already being outrageous ; but then I was hit with another $20 charge for her to stay . </s> <s> Even with a King bed ; they only figure in one person to their cost . </s> <s> The beds were average and although there was much to do ; everything cost an arm or a leg . </s> <s> It was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away . </s> <s> All in all for the amount of money that I was paying on a per night basis ; if I was in Chicago for any longer than that one night ; I definitely would have stayed somewhere else . </s> <s> I guess you live and you learn ; its just a shame that I had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations .

<s> After recent week stay at the Affinia Hotels ; I can definitely say i will be coming back . </s> <s> They offer so many in room amenities and services ; Just a very comfortable and relaxed place to be . </s> <s> My most enjoyable experience at the Affinia Hotel was the amazing customization they offered ; I would recommend Affinia hotels to anyone looking for a nice place to stay .

<s> When I first made reservations at The Palmer House Hilton ; I was excited because of all the gorgeous pictures displayed on their website . </s> <s> Little did I know it was going to be a total disaster . </s> <s> First off ; my husband and I couldn 't find the place . </s> <s> It was our first time in Chicago after all . </s> <s> And when I would call for directions ; they just kept putting me on hold . </s> <s> When my husband and I finally arrived ; the bus boy was extremely rude . </s> <s> After man-handling our luggage ; he held his hands out impatiently expecting a tip . </s> <s> Talk about arrogant . </s> <s> The front desk clerk was a little too pushy . </s> <s> My husband and I were only staying one night just to attend my sister 's wedding ; but they kept trying to up-sell a suite when all we needed was a regular guest room . </s> <s> The room itself was okay ; decorated so ornately that they are forced to jack up the price and take all that you 're worth . </s> <s> They even had the nerve to try and say that we purchased some items from the " snack bar " and ordered a movie that I 've never even heard of ! </s> <s> Completely unprofessional . </s> <s> I will never ; I repeat ; NEVER stay at this hotel ever again . ' </s> 
<s> Homewood Suites - Wonderful stay at the Homewood Suites Hilton ! </s> <s> Great location ; within walking distance to the Magnificent Mile . </s> <s> Clean room and attentive staff . </s> <s> Take time to visit the pool as it has a great view of the cityscape . </s> <s> Would definitely stay here again next time I am in Chicago .

<s> I had a business trip coming up in Chicago and I wanted to stay someplace really nice ; cause I had never been there ; so made reservations with the James two weeks in advance just to be on the safe side and when I arrived they had no record of it . </s> <s> No big deal ; right ? </s> <s> They said they would take care of it and get me a room right away . . . </s> <s> two hours later I 'm still sitting in the lobby ! </s> <s> Finally I get to my room to try and relax . </s> <s> Everything was nice until I decided to take a shower . </s> <s> I went into the bathroom . . . </s> <s> no towels ; wash cloths ; nothing . </s> <s> I called down to the front desk and asked for some ; about an hour later someone came up with one . </s> <s> Maybe they were just really busy ? </s> <s> Finally I get in the shower and the handle is BROKEN ! ! ! </s> <s> I went down to the front desk and asked for a new room and they started implying that I broke it ! ! ! </s> <s> They said everything was fine with the room earlier that day and that I must have done something to it ! ! ! </s> <s> Leaving that hotel was the easiest decision I made on my whole trip . </s> <s> Two thumbs down !

<s> I had high hopes for the Ambassador East Hotel ; I really did . </s> <s> It seemed like a nice enough place with reasonably close beach access . </s> <s> I arrived to the hotel on a Tuesday afternoon . </s> <s> I was immediately surprised by the state of disrepair that the building was in . </s> <s> I could actually see two members of hotel maintenance in the parking lot sitting in their truck ; doing nothing . </s> <s> As I walked in ; nobody greeted me ; and nobody offered to take my bags . </s> <s> The hotel furniture looked quaint and outdated ; with a fine covering of dust . </s> <s> I went to the counter to check in and the disinterested girl working barely glanced at my papers and slid me my keys ; all while avoiding eye contact and typing on the computer . </s> <s> I got to my room ; and despite specifically asking for nonsmoking ; there was a distinct smell of cigarettes inside and in the hallway . </s> <s> Having paid extra for an upgraded room ; I was extremely disappointed by the condition inside . </s> <s> The drinking glasses were filthy ; the towels smelled of mold ; and there was actually trash that was left in the bathroom trash can . </s> <s> The television was a basic CRT that looked to be about fifteen years old ; and there was no channel guide ; though I suppose I didn 't need one for the six channels that it had . </s> <s> I had heard good things about the food at the Ambassador East hotel ; but alas ; there was no respite here . </s> <s> The room service that I ordered took forty minutes to arrive ; and my steak was cold and cooked beyond well done . </s> <s> Elsewhere in the hotel things were no better . </s> <s> Everywhere I went ; from the pool to the bar ; the staff was hasty ; rude ; and completely uninterested ; and nowhere was particularly clean or well decorated . </s> <s> I really wanted to like the Ambassador East Hotel ; but unfortunately the best part of my stay was checking out .

<s> I recently stayed at this hotel not to long ago . </s> <s> Sure ; it looks nice ; but it 's really just a smoke screen . </s> <s> I went to the clerk to check in and she was VERY rude to me . </s> <s> I was asking about nearby attractions and she abruptly cut me off to tell me that I need to go find a phone book and ask someone else . </s> <s> She also encoded my key wrong ; so I had to have it redone . </s> <s> I finaly get to my room ; only to discover it was a mess . </s> <s> The sheets were thrown on the floor ; the curtains were wide open and to top it all off ; the toliet hadn 't been flushed . </s> <s> It was horrible . </s> <s> I called the front desk to have a maid come and fix it up ; but I was told they were on break . </s> <s> Whatever thoguh ; I cleaned up myself . </s> <s> The night progresses and I awaken to the sound of someone beating on my door . </s> <s> Some guy said that I was in HIS room . </s> <s> It baffled me ; but we went straight down to the lobby and got it cleared up . </s> <s> They had given his the wrong room . </s> <s> I couldn 't take one more day of all the bull . </s> <s> I checked out early the next morning and stayed at a different hotel for the remainder of my visit to Chicago . </s> <s> I would NOT recommend this hotel to ANYONE .

<s> My stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago was an amazing experience ! </s> <s> The staff were helpful and considerate ; always there to tend to my needs . </s> <s> My suite was extremely clean ; and had all the amenities that I could ask for . </s> <s> I almost didn 't want to leave my room ; because it was so nice . </s> <s> But in the end I did ; because the hotel is situated in such a great area ; that I had to go out and see some of the sites . </s> <s> This hotel has wonderful rooms and service ; and is in a really great area . </s> <s> I suggest that everyone come here if they are staying in Chicago . ' </s> 
<s> Fantastic stay ! </s> <s> The hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean . </s> <s> I chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was VERY close to my business conference . </s> <s> Here you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown Chicago charm . </s> <s> Be sure to try the ribs at South Water Kitchen next door . </s> <s> They are the best I 've ever had . </s> <s> EVER ! </s> <s> If youre in the mood to unwind ; you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around . </s> <s> I had a great time here . </s> <s> From now on ; I won 't stay anyplace else .

<s> The pictures on this website sure are deceiving ! </s> <s> In real life the Palmer House Hilton is not nearly as pretty as its made out to be ! </s> <s> The cleaning staff was still there when we arrived at our room and they made us wait outside while they were still cleaning ! </s> <s> Now ; granted it was only 15 minutes and sometimes guests can be messy but I thought that was the only weird thing I would have to put up with on that trip . </s> <s> It wasn 't ! </s> <s> They charged us for a mini-bar fee when we don 't even drink ; no one told us that we would have to pay for liquor anyway ! </s> <s> They also did not get our wake-up calls to us on time ; so we missed our tour bus and almost a whole day of our trip . </s> <s> We had to spend $50 extra bucks on cab fees just so we could see the city in the way we 'd planned ! </s> <s> And then it wasn 't as good because the tour guide wasn 't there and we got lost ! </s> <s> My husband lost the key to our room at one point on this trip and the desk gave him a hard time about getting a new one . </s> <s> It was terrible ! </s> <s> I certainly won 't be staying here again !

<s> I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for a fun weekend in Chicago . </s> <s> The standard room had a nice king size bed that was nice and comfortable . </s> <s> I love a hotel with all white sheets because then I know it 's clean . </s> <s> I really liked the simple and modern decor ; especially the huge upholstered headboard . </s> <s> Nice fixtures in the bathroom and granite counter . </s> <s> The bathroom was so much nicer than my own bathroom at home . </s> <s> The staff was friendly . </s> <s> Can 't really judge the service because I didn 't have any problems or complaints . </s> <s> So I didn 't have a reason to interact with the staff much . </s> <s> Overall ; it was a very nice hotel in a great location . </s> <s> Will definitely stay here again on my next visit .

<s> I stayed here with my family when we were in Chicago on a family vacation . </s> <s> All I can say is WOW ! </s> <s> A fantastic experience all around . </s> <s> First off ; the hotel is magnificent ; the lobby 'entreway is jaw dropping to say the least . </s> <s> Everyone we dealt with from the desk clerks ; to the cleaning staff ; to the doormen were all exceptionally cordial and friendly . </s> <s> The rooms themselves are fantastic ; perfect for a business person there for a stay or for a family there for recreation . </s> <s> The new Serenity beds that the Hilton offered were to die for ! </s> <s> One of the most restful nights sleep i have had in years ! </s> <s> The kids loved the Ipod docks in the rooms and my wife and I loved th fact the kids could keep their bedroom ice cold like they like it and we could keep it warmer in ours . </s> <s> As usual ; it had wifi ; which was ultra cheap and very very fast . </s> <s> Over all i highly recommend The Palmer House Hilton !

<s> Upon entering my hotel room at The Palmer House Hilton I immediately turned my nose up at a foul odor coming from the bathroom . </s> <s> After placing my bags on a poorly made bed I walked into the bathroom to find the last visitor had failed to flush the toilet . </s> <s> I immediately called room service and asked for a new room . </s> <s> They apologetically told me there were no other rooms available but would send someone right up to handle the mess . </s> <s> After oh around a half hour of waiting a very angry maid knocked at my door . </s> <s> She seemed very irritated to have to deal with the mess and looked at me as if I should have been the one dealing with it . </s> <s> After the room was cleaned up she turned to me as if asking for a tip . </s> <s> I hesitated and she angrily stormed out of the room . </s> <s> I thought things would run smoother and tried to relax with an ipod . </s> <s> Yes you can use your ipod in the room however what they fail to mention is the constant white noise because the signals are so poor . </s> <s> And nothing could compare to the remote control heating and air . </s> <s> When I was able to get the buttons on the remote to work the temperature seemed to change on its own . </s> <s> If I wanted hot air it would slowly get colder and vise versa . </s> <s> After giving up on a nice television program I decided to retire to bed . </s> <s> Egyptian sheets ? </s> <s> Right ! </s> <s> All I can say is I found myself early to check out and in a new hotel within the next hour . </s> <s> If you value your back do not rent a room from this hotel .
