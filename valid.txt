<s> In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of
Israel came up against Judah , and built Ramah , to the intent that he
might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah . </s>
<s> Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the
house of the LORD and of the king 's house , and sent to Benhadad king
of Syria , that dwelt at Damascus , saying , There is a league
between me and thee , as there was between my father and thy father :
behold , I have sent thee silver and gold ; go , break thy league with
Baasha king of Israel , that he may depart from me . </s>
<s> And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa , and sent the captains of
his armies against the cities of Israel ; and they smote Ijon , and Dan ,
and Abelmaim , and all the store cities of Naphtali . </s>
<s> And it came to pass , when Baasha heard it , that he left off
building of Ramah , and let his work cease . </s>
<s> Then Asa the king took all Judah ; and they carried away the
stones of Ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith Baasha was
building ; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah . </s>
<s> And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah , and
said unto him , Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria , and not
relied on the LORD thy God , therefore is the host of the king of Syria
escaped out of thine hand . </s>
<s> Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host , with very
many chariots and horsemen ? </s>
<s> yet , because thou didst rely on the LORD ,
he delivered them into thine hand . </s>
<s> For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
earth , to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is
perfect toward him . </s>
<s> Herein thou hast done foolishly : therefore from
henceforth thou shalt have wars . </s>
<s> Then Asa was wroth with the seer , and put him in a prison house ;
for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . </s>
<s> And Asa oppressed
some of the people the same time . </s>
<s> And , behold , the acts of Asa , first and last , lo , they are
written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel . </s>
<s> And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
in his feet , until his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease
he sought not to the LORD , but to the physicians . </s>
<s> And Asa slept with his fathers , and died in the one and fortieth
year of his reign . </s>
<s> And they buried him in his own sepulchres , which he had made for
himself in the city of David , and laid him in the bed which was filled
with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the
apothecaries ' art : and they made a very great burning for him . </s>
<s> And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead , and strengthened
himself against Israel . </s>
<s> And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah , and set
garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim , which
Asa his father had taken . </s>
<s> And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat , because he walked in the first
ways of his father David , and sought not unto Baalim ; But sought
to the Lord God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not
after the doings of Israel . </s>
<s> Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand ; and all
Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents ; and he had riches and honour in
abundance . </s>
<s> And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD : moreover he
took away the high places and groves out of Judah . </s>
<s> Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes , even
to Benhail , and to Obadiah , and to Zechariah , and to Nethaneel , and to
Michaiah , to teach in the cities of Judah . </s>
<s> And with them he sent Levites , even Shemaiah , and Nethaniah , and
Zebadiah , and Asahel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehonathan , and Adonijah ,
and Tobijah , and Tobadonijah , Levites ; and with them Elishama and
Jehoram , priests . </s>
<s> And they taught in Judah , and had the book of the law of the LORD
with them , and went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and
taught the people . </s>
<s> And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands
that were round about Judah , so that they made no war against
Jehoshaphat . </s>
<s> Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents , and
tribute silver ; and the Arabians brought him flocks , seven thousand
and seven hundred rams , and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats . </s>
<s> And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly ; and he built in Judah
castles , and cities of store . </s>
<s> And he had much business in the cities of Judah : and the men of
war , mighty men of valour , were in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And these are the numbers of them according to the house of
their fathers : Of Judah , the captains of thousands ; Adnah the chief ,
and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand . </s>
<s> And next to him was Jehohanan the captain , and with him two
hundred and fourscore thousand . </s>
<s> And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri , who willingly
offered himself unto the LORD ; and with him two hundred thousand
mighty men of valour . </s>
<s> And of Benjamin ; Eliada a mighty man of valour , and with him
armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand . </s>
<s> And next him was Jehozabad , and with him an hundred and
fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war . </s>
<s> These waited on the king , beside those whom the king put in the
fenced cities throughout all Judah . </s>
<s> Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance , and joined
affinity with Ahab . </s>
<s> And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria . </s>
<s> And Ahab
killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance , and for the people that he
had with him , and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead . </s>
<s> And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah , Wilt
thou go with me to Ramothgilead ? </s>
<s> And he answered him , I am as thou
art , and my people as thy people ; and we will be with thee in the war . </s>
<s> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel , Enquire , I pray
thee , at the word of the LORD to day . </s>
<s> Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four
hundred men , and said unto them , Shall we go to Ramothgilead to
battle , or shall I forbear ? </s>
<s> And they said , Go up ; for God will deliver
it into the king 's hand . </s>
<s> But Jehoshaphat said , Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
besides , that we might enquire of him ? </s>
<s>  And the king of Israel
said unto Jehoshaphat , There is yet one man , by whom we may enquire of
the LORD : but I hate him ; for he never prophesied good unto me , but
always evil : the same is Micaiah the son of Imla . </s>
<s> And Jehoshaphat
said , Let not the king say so . </s>
<s> And the king of Israel called for one of his officers , and said ,
Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla . </s>
<s> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either
of them on his throne , clothed in their robes , and they sat in a void
place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets
prophesied before them . </s>
<s> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron ,
and said , Thus saith the LORD , With these thou shalt push Syria until
they be consumed . </s>
<s> And all the prophets prophesied so , saying , Go up to
Ramothgilead , and prosper : for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand
of the king . </s>
<s> And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him ,
saying , Behold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king
with one assent ; let thy word therefore , I pray thee , be like one of
their 's , and speak thou good . </s>
<s> And Micaiah said , As the LORD liveth , even what my God saith ,
that will I speak . </s>
<s> And when he was come to the king , the king said unto him ,
Micaiah , shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle , or shall I forbear ? </s>
<s> he said , Go ye up , and prosper , and they shall be delivered into
your hand . </s>
<s> And the king said to him , How many times shall I adjure thee
that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD ? </s>
<s> Then he said , I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains ,
as sheep that have no shepherd : and the LORD said , These have no
master ; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace . </s>
<s> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , Did I not tell thee
that he would not prophesy good unto me , but evil ? </s>
<s>  Again he
said , Therefore hear the word of the LORD ; I saw the LORD sitting upon
his throne , and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and
on his left . </s>
<s> And the LORD said , Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel , that he
may go up and fall at Ramothgilead ? </s>
<s> And one spake saying after this
manner , and another saying after that manner . </s>
<s> Then there came out a spirit , and stood before the LORD , and
said , I will entice him . </s>
<s> And the LORD said unto him , Wherewith ? </s>
<s> 
And he said , I will go out , and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all
his prophets . </s>
<s> And the Lord said , Thou shalt entice him , and thou shalt
also prevail : go out , and do even so . </s>
<s> Now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
mouth of these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil against
thee . </s>
<s> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near , and smote Micaiah
upon the cheek , and said , Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from
me to speak unto thee ? </s>
<s>  And Micaiah said , Behold , thou shalt see
on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself . </s>
<s> Then the king of Israel said , Take ye Micaiah , and carry him
back to Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son ;
 And say , Thus saith the king , Put this fellow in the prison , and
feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until
I return in peace . </s>
<s> And Micaiah said , If thou certainly return in peace , then hath
not the LORD spoken by me . </s>
<s> And he said , Hearken , all ye people . </s>
<s> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up
to Ramothgilead . </s>
<s> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , I will disguise
myself , and I will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . </s>
<s> So the
king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went to the battle . </s>
<s> Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots
that were with him , saying , Fight ye not with small or great , save
only with the king of Israel . </s>
<s> And it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw
Jehoshaphat , that they said , It is the king of Israel . </s>
<s> Therefore they
compassed about him to fight : but Jehoshaphat cried out , and the LORD
helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him . </s>
<s> For it came to pass , that , when the captains of the chariots
perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back again
from pursuing him . </s>
<s> And a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of
Israel between the joints of the harness : therefore he said to his
chariot man , Turn thine hand , that thou mayest carry me out of the
host ; for I am wounded . </s>
<s> And the battle increased that day : howbeit the king of Israel
stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even :
and about the time of the sun going down he died . </s>
<s> And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace
to Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him , and
said to king Jehoshaphat , Shouldest thou help the ungodly , and love
them that hate the LORD ? </s>
<s> therefore is wrath upon thee from before the
LORD . </s>
<s> Nevertheless there are good things found in thee , in that thou
hast taken away the groves out of the land , and hast prepared thine
heart to seek God . </s>
<s> And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem : and he went out again through
the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim , and brought them back unto
the LORD God of their fathers . </s>
<s> And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of
Judah , city by city , And said to the judges , Take heed what ye
do : for ye judge not for man , but for the LORD , who is with you in the
judgment . </s>
<s> Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you ; take heed and
do it : for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God , nor respect of
persons , nor taking of gifts . </s>
<s> Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites , and of
the priests , and of the chief of the fathers of Israel , for the
judgment of the LORD , and for controversies , when they returned to
Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And he charged them , saying , Thus shall ye do in the fear of the
LORD , faithfully , and with a perfect heart . </s>
<s> And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
dwell in your cities , between blood and blood , between law and
commandment , statutes and judgments , ye shall even warn them that they
trespass not against the LORD , and so wrath come upon you , and upon
your brethren : this do , and ye shall not trespass . </s>
<s> And , behold , Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters
of the LORD ; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael , the ruler of the house
of Judah , for all the king 's matters : also the Levites shall be
officers before you . </s>
<s> Deal courageously , and the LORD shall be with the
good . </s>
<s> It came to pass after this also , that the children of Moab , and
the children of Ammon , and with them other beside the Ammonites , came
against Jehoshaphat to battle . </s>
<s> Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat , saying , There cometh
a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria ;
and , behold , they be in Hazazontamar , which is Engedi . </s>
<s> And Jehoshaphat feared , and set himself to seek the LORD , and
proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah . </s>
<s> And Judah gathered themselves together , to ask help of the LORD :
even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD . </s>
<s> And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem ,
in the house of the LORD , before the new court , And said , O LORD
God of our fathers , art not thou God in heaven ? </s>
<s> and rulest not thou
over all the kingdoms of the heathen ? </s>
<s> and in thine hand is there not
power and might , so that none is able to withstand thee ? </s>
<s>  Art not
thou our God , who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before
thy people Israel , and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for
ever ? </s>
<s>  And they dwelt therein , and have built thee a sanctuary
therein for thy name , saying , If , when evil cometh upon us , as
the sword , judgment , or pestilence , or famine , we stand before this
house , and in thy presence , (for thy name is in this house ,) and cry
unto thee in our affliction , then thou wilt hear and help . </s>
<s> And now , behold , the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir ,
whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade , when they came out of the
land of Egypt , but they turned from them , and destroyed them not ;
 Behold , I say , how they reward us , to come to cast us out of thy
possession , which thou hast given us to inherit . </s>
<s> O our God , wilt thou not judge them ? </s>
<s> for we have no might
against this great company that cometh against us ; neither know we
what to do : but our eyes are upon thee . </s>
<s> And all Judah stood before the LORD , with their little ones ,
their wives , and their children . </s>
<s> Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the
son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , a Levite of the sons of Asaph ,
came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation ; 
And he said , Hearken ye , all Judah , and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem ,
and thou king Jehoshaphat , Thus saith the LORD unto you , Be not afraid
nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not
yours , but God 's . </s>
<s> To morrow go ye down against them : behold , they come up by the
cliff of Ziz ; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook , before
the wilderness of Jeruel . </s>
<s> Ye shall not need to fight in this battle : set yourselves , stand
ye still , and see the salvation of the LORD with you , O Judah and
Jerusalem : fear not , nor be dismayed ; to morrow go out against them :
for the LORD will be with you . </s>
<s> And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground : and
all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD ,
worshipping the LORD . </s>
<s> And the Levites , of the children of the Kohathites , and of the
children of the Korhites , stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel
with a loud voice on high . </s>
<s> And they rose early in the morning , and went forth into the
wilderness of Tekoa : and as they went forth , Jehoshaphat stood and
said , Hear me , O Judah , and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem ; Believe in
the LORD your God , so shall ye be established ; believe his prophets ,
so shall ye prosper . </s>
<s> And when he had consulted with the people , he appointed singers
unto the LORD , and that should praise the beauty of holiness , as they
went out before the army , and to say , Praise the LORD ; for his mercy
endureth for ever . </s>
<s> And when they began to sing and to praise , the LORD set
ambushments against the children of Ammon , Moab , and mount Seir , which
were come against Judah ; and they were smitten . </s>
<s> For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
inhabitants of mount Seir , utterly to slay and destroy them : and when
they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , every one helped to
destroy another . </s>
<s> And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness ,
they looked unto the multitude , and , behold , they were dead bodies
fallen to the earth , and none escaped . </s>
<s> And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil
of them , they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead
bodies , and precious jewels , which they stripped off for themselves ,
more than they could carry away : and they were three days in gathering
of the spoil , it was so much . </s>
<s> And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of
Berachah ; for there they blessed the LORD : therefore the name of the
same place was called , The valley of Berachah , unto this day . </s>
<s> Then they returned , every man of Judah and Jerusalem , and
Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them , to go again to Jerusalem with
joy ; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies . </s>
<s> And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and
trumpets unto the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries ,
when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of
Israel . </s>
<s> So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet : for his God gave him rest
round about . </s>
<s> And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty and five years
old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and five years in
Jerusalem . </s>
<s> his mother 's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi . </s>
<s> And he walked in the way of Asa his father , and departed not
from it , doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD . </s>
<s> Howbeit the high places were not taken away : for as yet the
people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers . </s>
<s> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , first and last , behold ,
they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani , who is
mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel . </s>
<s> And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
Ahaziah king of Israel , who did very wickedly : And he joined
himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish : and they made the
ships in Eziongaber . </s>
<s> Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
Jehoshaphat , saying , Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah ,
the LORD hath broken thy works . </s>
<s> And the ships were broken , that they
were not able to go to Tarshish . </s>
<s> Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David . </s>
<s> And Jehoram his son reigned in his
stead . </s>
<s> And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat , Azariah , and Jehiel ,
and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah : all these
were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel . </s>
<s> And their father gave them great gifts of silver , and of gold ,
and of precious things , with fenced cities in Judah : but the kingdom
gave he to Jehoram ; because he was the firstborn . </s>
<s> Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father , he
strengthened himself , and slew all his brethren with the sword , and
divers also of the princes of Israel . </s>
<s> Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign , and
he reigned eight years in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , like as did the
house of Ahab : for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife : and he wrought
that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD . </s>
<s> Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David , because of
the covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a
light to him and to his sons for ever . </s>
<s> In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of
Judah , and made themselves a king . </s>
<s> Then Jehoram went forth with his princes , and all his chariots
with him : and he rose up by night , and smote the Edomites which
compassed him in , and the captains of the chariots . </s>
<s> So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this
day . </s>
<s> same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand ; because he
had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers . </s>
<s> Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and
caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication , and
compelled Judah thereto . </s>
<s> And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet , saying ,
Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father , Because thou hast not
walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father , nor in the ways of Asa
king of Judah , But hast walked in the way of the kings of
Israel , and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a
whoring , like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab , and also hast
slain thy brethren of thy father 's house , which were better than
thyself : Behold , with a great plague will the LORD smite thy
people , and thy children , and thy wives , and all thy goods : And
thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels , until thy
bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day . </s>
<s> Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
Philistines , and of the Arabians , that were near the Ethiopians : 
And they came up into Judah , and brake into it , and carried away all
the substance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also ,
and his wives ; so that there was never a son left him , save Jehoahaz ,
the youngest of his sons . </s>
<s> And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
incurable disease . </s>
<s> And it came to pass , that in process of time , after the end of
two years , his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness : so he died
of sore diseases . </s>
<s> And his people made no burning for him , like the
burning of his fathers . </s>
<s> Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign , and he
reigned in Jerusalem eight years , and departed without being desired . </s>
<s> they buried him in the city of David , but not in the
sepulchres of the kings . </s>
<s> And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son
king in his stead : for the band of men that came with the Arabians to
the camp had slain all the eldest . </s>
<s> So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king
of Judah reigned . </s>
<s> Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign , and
he reigned one year in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> His mother 's name also was Athaliah
the daughter of Omri . </s>
<s> He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab : for his mother
was his counsellor to do wickedly . </s>
<s> Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of
Ahab : for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to
his destruction . </s>
<s> He walked also after their counsel , and went with Jehoram the son
of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at
Ramothgilead : and the Syrians smote Joram . </s>
<s> And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds
which were given him at Ramah , when he fought with Hazael king of
Syria . </s>
<s> And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see
Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel , because he was sick . </s>
<s> And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram : for
when he was come , he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of
Nimshi , whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab . </s>
<s> And it came to pass , that , when Jehu was executing judgment upon
the house of Ahab , and found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the
brethren of Ahaziah , that ministered to Ahaziah , he slew them . </s>
<s> And he sought Ahaziah : and they caught him , (for he was hid in
Samaria ,) and brought him to Jehu : and when they had slain him , they
buried him : Because , said they , he is the son of Jehoshaphat , who
sought the LORD with all his heart . </s>
<s> So the house of Ahaziah had no
power to keep still the kingdom . </s>
<s> But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
dead , she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of
Judah . </s>
<s> But Jehoshabeath , the daughter of the king , took Joash the son
of Ahaziah , and stole him from among the king 's sons that were slain ,
and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber . </s>
<s> So Jehoshabeath , the
daughter of king Jehoram , the wife of Jehoiada the priest , (for she
was the sister of Ahaziah ,) hid him from Athaliah , so that she slew
him not . </s>
<s> And he was with them hid in the house of God six years : and
Athaliah reigned over the land . </s>
<s> And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself , and took
the captains of hundreds , Azariah the son of Jeroham , and Ishmael the
son of Jehohanan , and Azariah the son of Obed , and Maaseiah the son of
Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri , into covenant with him . </s>
<s> And they went about in Judah , and gathered the Levites out of all
the cities of Judah , and the chief of the fathers of Israel , and they
came to Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
house of God . </s>
<s> And he said unto them , Behold , the king 's son shall
reign , as the LORD hath said of the sons of David . </s>
<s> This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you entering
on the sabbath , of the priests and of the Levites , shall be porters of
the doors ; And a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a
third part at the gate of the foundation : and all the people shall be
in the courts of the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> But let none come into the house of the LORD , save the priests ,
and they that minister of the Levites ; they shall go in , for they are
holy : but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD . </s>
<s> And the Levites shall compass the king round about , every man
with his weapons in his hand ; and whosoever else cometh into the
house , he shall be put to death : but be ye with the king when he
cometh in , and when he goeth out . </s>
<s> So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
Jehoiada the priest had commanded , and took every man his men that
were to come in on the sabbath , with them that were to go out on the
sabbath : for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses . </s>
<s> Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
hundreds spears , and bucklers , and shields , that had been king
David 's , which were in the house of God . </s>
<s> And he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his
hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the
temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about . </s>
<s> Then they brought out the king 's son , and put upon him the
crown , and gave him the testimony , and made him king . </s>
<s> And Jehoiada and
his sons anointed him , and said , God save the king . </s>
<s> Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
praising the king , she came to the people into the house of the LORD :
 And she looked , and , behold , the king stood at his pillar at the
entering in , and the princes and the trumpets by the king : and all the
people of the land rejoiced , and sounded with trumpets , also the
singers with instruments of musick , and such as taught to sing praise . </s>
<s> Athaliah rent her clothes , and said , Treason , Treason . </s>
<s> Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
that were set over the host , and said unto them , Have her forth of the
ranges : and whoso followeth her , let him be slain with the sword . </s>
<s> For
the priest said , Slay her not in the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> So they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering
of the horse gate by the king 's house , they slew her there . </s>
<s> And Jehoiada made a covenant between him , and between all the
people , and between the king , that they should be the LORD 's people . </s>
<s> Then all the people went to the house of Baal , and brake it
down , and brake his altars and his images in pieces , and slew Mattan
the priest of Baal before the altars . </s>
<s> Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by
the hand of the priests the Levites , whom David had distributed in the
house of the LORD , to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD , as it is
written in the law of Moses , with rejoicing and with singing , as it
was ordained by David . </s>
<s> And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD ,
that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in . </s>
<s> And he took the captains of hundreds , and the nobles , and the
governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought
down the king from the house of the LORD : and they came through the
high gate into the king 's house , and set the king upon the throne of
the kingdom . </s>
<s> And all the people of the land rejoiced : and the city was quiet ,
after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword . </s>
<s> Joash was seven years old when he began to reign , and he reigned
forty years in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> His mother 's name also was Zibiah of
Beersheba . </s>
<s> And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all
the days of Jehoiada the priest . </s>
<s> And Jehoiada took for him two wives ; and he begat sons and
daughters . </s>
<s> And it came to pass after this , that Joash was minded to repair
the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> And he gathered together the priests and the Levites , and said to
them , Go out unto the cities of Judah , and gather of all Israel money
to repair the house of your God from year to year , and see that ye
hasten the matter . </s>
<s> Howbeit the Levites hastened it not . </s>
<s> And the king called for Jehoiada the chief , and said unto him ,
Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and
out of Jerusalem the collection , according to the commandment of Moses
the servant of the LORD , and of the congregation of Israel , for the
tabernacle of witness ? </s>
<s>  For the sons of Athaliah , that wicked
woman , had broken up the house of God ; and also all the dedicated
things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim . </s>
<s> And at the king 's commandment they made a chest , and set it
without at the gate of the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to
bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid
upon Israel in the wilderness . </s>
<s> And all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in ,
and cast into the chest , until they had made an end . </s>
<s> Now it came to pass , that at what time the chest was brought
unto the king 's office by the hand of the Levites , and when they saw
that there was much money , the king 's scribe and the high priest 's
officer came and emptied the chest , and took it , and carried it to his
place again . </s>
<s> Thus they did day by day , and gathered money in
abundance . </s>
<s> And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the
service of the house of the LORD , and hired masons and carpenters to
repair the house of the LORD , and also such as wrought iron and brass
to mend the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> So the workmen wrought , and the work was perfected by them , and
they set the house of God in his state , and strengthened it . </s>
<s> And when they had finished it , they brought the rest of the
money before the king and Jehoiada , whereof were made vessels for the
house of the LORD , even vessels to minister , and to offer withal , and
spoons , and vessels of gold and silver . </s>
<s> And they offered burnt
offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of
Jehoiada . </s>
<s> But Jehoiada waxed old , and was full of days when he died ; an
hundred and thirty years old was he when he died . </s>
<s> And they buried him in the city of David among the kings ,
because he had done good in Israel , both toward God , and toward his
house . </s>
<s> Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah , and
made obeisance to the king . </s>
<s> Then the king hearkened unto them . </s>
<s> And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers , and
served groves and idols : and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for
this their trespass . </s>
<s> Yet he sent prophets to them , to bring them again unto the LORD ;
and they testified against them : but they would not give ear . </s>
<s> And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
the priest , which stood above the people , and said unto them , Thus
saith God , Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD , that ye
cannot prosper ? </s>
<s> because ye have forsaken the LORD , he hath also
forsaken you . </s>
<s> And they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at
the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada
his father had done to him , but slew his son . </s>
<s> And when he died , he
said , The LORD look upon it , and require it . </s>
<s> And it came to pass at the end of the year , that the host of
Syria came up against him : and they came to Judah and Jerusalem , and
destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people , and
sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus . </s>
<s> For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men ,
and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand , because they
had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers . </s>
<s> So they executed judgment
against Joash . </s>
<s> And when they were departed from him , (for they left him in
great diseases ,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood
of the sons of Jehoiada the priest , and slew him on his bed , and he
died : and they buried him in the city of David , but they buried him
not in the sepulchres of the kings . </s>
<s> And these are they that conspired against him ; Zabad the son of
Shimeath an Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess . </s>
<s> Now concerning his sons , and the greatness of the burdens laid
upon him , and the repairing of the house of God , behold , they are
written in the story of the book of the kings . </s>
<s> And Amaziah his son
reigned in his stead . </s>
<s> Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and
he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And his mother 's name
was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , but not
with a perfect heart . </s>
<s> Now it came to pass , when the kingdom was established to him ,
that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father . </s>
<s> But he slew not their children , but did as it is written in the
law in the book of Moses , where the LORD commanded , saying , The
fathers shall not die for the children , neither shall the children die
for the fathers , but every man shall die for his own sin . </s>
<s> Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together , and made them captains
over thousands , and captains over hundreds , according to the houses of
their fathers , throughout all Judah and Benjamin : and he numbered them
from twenty years old and above , and found them three hundred thousand
choice men , able to go forth to war , that could handle spear and
shield . </s>
<s> He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
Israel for an hundred talents of silver . </s>
<s> But there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the
army of Israel go with thee ; for the LORD is not with Israel , to wit ,
with all the children of Ephraim . </s>
<s> But if thou wilt go , do it ; be strong for the battle : God shall
make thee fall before the enemy : for God hath power to help , and to
cast down . </s>
<s> And Amaziah said to the man of God , But what shall we do for the
hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel ? </s>
<s> And the man
of God answered , The LORD is able to give thee much more than this . </s>
<s> Then Amaziah separated them , to wit , the army that was come to
him out of Ephraim , to go home again : wherefore their anger was
greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in great anger . </s>
<s> And Amaziah strengthened himself , and led forth his people , and
went to the valley of salt , and smote of the children of Seir ten
thousand . </s>
<s> And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah
carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and
cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in
pieces . </s>
<s> But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back , that they
should not go with him to battle , fell upon the cities of Judah , from
Samaria even unto Bethhoron , and smote three thousand of them , and
took much spoil . </s>
<s> Now it came to pass , after that Amaziah was come from the
slaughter of the Edomites , that he brought the gods of the children of
Seir , and set them up to be his gods , and bowed down himself before
them , and burned incense unto them . </s>
<s> Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah , and
he sent unto him a prophet , which said unto him , Why hast thou sought
after the gods of the people , which could not deliver their own people
out of thine hand ? </s>
<s>  And it came to pass , as he talked with him ,
that the king said unto him , Art thou made of the king 's counsel ? </s>
<s> why shouldest thou be smitten ? </s>
<s> Then the prophet forbare , and
said , I know that God hath determined to destroy thee , because thou
hast done this , and hast not hearkened unto my counsel . </s>
<s> Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice , and sent to Joash , the
son of Jehoahaz , the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let us
see one another in the face . </s>
<s> And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah , saying ,
The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon ,
saying , Give thy daughter to my son to wife : and there passed by a
wild beast that was in Lebanon , and trode down the thistle . </s>
<s> Thou sayest , Lo , thou hast smitten the Edomites ; and thine heart
lifteth thee up to boast : abide now at home ; why shouldest thou meddle
to thine hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and Judah with
thee ? </s>
<s>  But Amaziah would not hear ; for it came of God , that he
might deliver them into the hand of their enemies , because they sought
after the gods of Edom . </s>
<s> So Joash the king of Israel went up ; and they saw one another in
the face , both he and Amaziah king of Judah , at Bethshemesh , which
belongeth to Judah . </s>
<s> And Judah was put to the worse before Israel , and they fled
every man to his tent . </s>
<s> And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son
of Joash , the son of Jehoahaz , at Bethshemesh , and brought him to
Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of
Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits . </s>
<s> And he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels
that were found in the house of God with Obededom , and the treasures
of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria . </s>
<s> And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death
of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years . </s>
<s> Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah , first and last , behold , are
they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel ? </s>
<s> 
Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD
they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to
Lachish : but they sent to Lachish after him , and slew him there . </s>
<s> And they brought him upon horses , and buried him with his
fathers in the city of Judah . </s>
<s> Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah , who was sixteen years
old , and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah . </s>

slept with his fathers . </s>
<s> Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign , and he

according to all that his father Amaziah did . </s>
<s> And he sought God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding
in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the LORD , God made him
to prosper . </s>
<s> And he went forth and warred against the Philistines , and brake
down the wall of Gath , and the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod ,
and built cities about Ashdod , and among the Philistines . </s>
<s> And God helped him against the Philistines , and against the
Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal , and the Mehunims . </s>
<s> And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah : and his name spread
abroad even to the entering in of Egypt ; for he strengthened himself
exceedingly . </s>
<s> Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and
at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified
them . </s>
<s> Also he built towers in the desert , and digged many wells : for
he had much cattle , both in the low country , and in the plains :
husbandmen also , and vine dressers in the mountains , and in Carmel :
for he loved husbandry . </s>
<s> Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men , that went out to
war by bands , according to the number of their account by the hand of
Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler , under the hand of Hananiah ,
one of the king 's captains . </s>
<s> The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men
of valour were two thousand and six hundred . </s>

<s> And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields ,
and spears , and helmets , and habergeons , and bows , and slings to cast
stones . </s>
<s> And he made in Jerusalem engines , invented by cunning men , to be
on the towers and upon the bulwarks , to shoot arrows and great stones
withal . </s>
<s> his name spread far abroad ; for he was marvellously helped , till
he was strong . </s>
<s> But when he was strong , his heart was lifted up to his
destruction : for he transgressed against the LORD his God , and went
into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense . </s>
<s> And Azariah the priest went in after him , and with him fourscore
priests of the LORD , that were valiant men : And they withstood
Uzziah the king , and said unto him , It appertaineth not unto thee ,
Uzziah , to burn incense unto the LORD , but to the priests the sons of
Aaron , that are consecrated to burn incense : go out of the sanctuary ;
for thou hast trespassed ; neither shall it be for thine honour from
the LORD God . </s>
<s> Then Uzziah was wroth , and had a censer in his hand to burn
incense : and while he was wroth with the priests , the leprosy even
rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD ,
from beside the incense altar . </s>
<s> And Azariah the chief priest , and all the priests , looked upon
him , and , behold , he was leprous in his forehead , and they thrust him
out from thence ; yea , himself hasted also to go out , because the LORD
had smitten him . </s>
<s> And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death , and
dwelt in a several house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the
house of the LORD : and Jotham his son was over the king 's house ,
judging the people of the land . </s>
<s> Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah , first and last , did Isaiah
the prophet , the son of Amoz , write . </s>
<s> So Uzziah slept with his fathers , and they buried him with his
fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings ; for
they said , He is a leper : and Jotham his son reigned in his stead . </s>
<s> Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and
he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> His mother 's name also was
Jerushah , the daughter of Zadok . </s>
<s> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD ,
according to all that his father Uzziah did : howbeit he entered not
into the temple of the LORD . </s>
<s> And the people did yet corruptly . </s>
<s> He built the high gate of the house of the LORD , and on the wall
of Ophel he built much . </s>
<s> Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah , and in the
forests he built castles and towers . </s>
<s> He fought also with the king of the Ammonites , and prevailed
against them . </s>
<s> And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an
hundred talents of silver , and ten thousand measures of wheat , and ten
thousand of barley . </s>
<s> So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him ,
both the second year , and the third . </s>
<s> So Jotham became mighty , because he prepared his ways before the
LORD his God . </s>
<s> Now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his
ways , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and
Judah . </s>
<s> He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign , and
reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And Jotham slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the
city of David : and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead . </s>
<s> Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he reigned
sixteen years in Jerusalem : but he did not that which was right in the
sight of the LORD , like David his father : For he walked in the
ways of the kings of Israel , and made also molten images for Baalim . </s>
<s> Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and
burnt his children in the fire , after the abominations of the heathen
whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel . </s>
<s> He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places , and on
the hills , and under every green tree . </s>
<s> Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the
king of Syria ; and they smote him , and carried away a great multitude
of them captives , and brought them to Damascus . </s>
<s> And he was also
delivered into the hand of the king of Israel , who smote him with a
great slaughter . </s>
<s> For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty
thousand in one day , which were all valiant men ; because they had
forsaken the LORD God of their fathers . </s>
<s> And Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , slew Maaseiah the king 's
son , and Azrikam the governor of the house , and Elkanah that was next
to the king . </s>
<s> And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren
two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away
much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria . </s>
<s> But a prophet of the LORD was there , whose name was Oded : and he
went out before the host that came to Samaria , and said unto them ,
Behold , because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah , he
hath delivered them into your hand , and ye have slain them in a rage
that reacheth up unto heaven . </s>
<s> And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and
Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you : but are there not with
you , even with you , sins against the LORD your God ? </s>
<s>  Now hear me
therefore , and deliver the captives again , which ye have taken captive
of your brethren : for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you . </s>
<s> Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah
the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Jehizkiah
the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against them
that came from the war , And said unto them , Ye shall not bring
in the captives hither : for whereas we have offended against the LORD
already , ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass : for
our trespass is great , and there is fierce wrath against Israel . </s>
<s> So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the
princes and all the congregation . </s>
<s> And the men which were expressed by name rose up , and took the
captives , and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them ,
and arrayed them , and shod them , and gave them to eat and to drink ,

brought them to Jericho , the city of palm trees , to their brethren :
then they returned to Samaria . </s>
<s> At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to
help him . </s>
<s> For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah , and carried
away captives . </s>
<s> The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country ,
and of the south of Judah , and had taken Bethshemesh , and Ajalon , and
Gederoth , and Shocho with the villages thereof , and Timnah with the
villages thereof , Gimzo also and the villages thereof : and they dwelt
there . </s>
<s> For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel ;
for he made Judah naked , and transgressed sore against the LORD . </s>
<s> And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him , and
distressed him , but strengthened him not . </s>
<s> For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD , and
out of the house of the king , and of the princes , and gave it unto the
king of Assyria : but he helped him not . </s>
<s> And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against
the LORD : this is that king Ahaz . </s>
<s> For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus , which smote him :
and he said , Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them ,
therefore will I sacrifice to them , that they may help me . </s>
<s> But they
were the ruin of him , and of all Israel . </s>
<s> And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God , and
cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God , and shut up the doors
of the house of the LORD , and he made him altars in every corner of
Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn
incense unto other gods , and provoked to anger the LORD God of his
fathers . </s>
<s> Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways , first and last ,
behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel . </s>
<s> And Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the
city , even in Jerusalem : but they brought him not into the sepulchres
of the kings of Israel : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead . </s>
<s> Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old ,
and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And his mother 's
name was Abijah , the daughter of Zechariah . </s>
<s> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD ,
according to all that David his father had done . </s>
<s> He in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the
doors of the house of the LORD , and repaired them . </s>
<s> And he brought in the priests and the Levites , and gathered them
together into the east street , And said unto them , Hear me , ye
Levites , sanctify now yourselves , and sanctify the house of the LORD
God of your fathers , and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy
place . </s>
<s> For our fathers have trespassed , and done that which was evil in
the eyes of the LORD our God , and have forsaken him , and have turned
away their faces from the habitation of the LORD , and turned their
backs . </s>
<s> Also they have shut up the doors of the porch , and put out the
lamps , and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the
holy place unto the God of Israel . </s>
<s> Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem , and
he hath delivered them to trouble , to astonishment , and to hissing , as
ye see with your eyes . </s>
<s> For , lo , our fathers have fallen by the sword , and our sons and
our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this . </s>
<s> Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of
Israel , that his fierce wrath may turn away from us . </s>
<s> My sons , be not now negligent : for the LORD hath chosen you to

the Gershonites ; Joah the son of Zimmah , and Eden the son of Joah :

<s> And they gathered their brethren , and sanctified themselves , and

LORD , to cleanse the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
LORD , to cleanse it , and brought out all the uncleanness that they
found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the
LORD . </s>
<s> And the Levites took it , to carry it out abroad into the brook
Kidron . </s>
<s> Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify ,
and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD :
so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days ; and in the
sixteenth day of the first month they made an end . </s>
<s> Then they went in to Hezekiah the king , and said , We have
cleansed all the house of the LORD , and the altar of burnt offering ,

vessels thereof . </s>
<s> Moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign did cast
away in his transgression , have we prepared and sanctified , and ,
behold , they are before the altar of the LORD . </s>
<s> Then Hezekiah the king rose early , and gathered the rulers of
the city , and went up to the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> And they brought seven bullocks , and seven rams , and seven
lambs , and seven he goats , for a sin offering for the kingdom , and for
the sanctuary , and for Judah . </s>
<s> And he commanded the priests the sons of
Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD . </s>
<s> So they killed the bullocks , and the priests received the blood ,

lambs , and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar . </s>
<s> And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before
the king and the congregation ; and they laid their hands upon them :

be made for all Israel . </s>
<s> And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals ,

David , and of Gad the king 's seer , and Nathan the prophet : for so was
the commandment of the LORD by his prophets . </s>
<s> And the Levites stood with the instruments of David , and the
priests with the trumpets . </s>
<s> And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
altar . </s>
<s> when the burnt offering began , the song of the LORD began also
with the trumpets , and with the instruments ordained by David king of
Israel . </s>
<s> And all the congregation worshipped , and the singers sang , and
the trumpeters sounded : and all this continued until the burnt
offering was finished . </s>
<s> And when they had made an end of offering , the king and all that
were present with him bowed themselves , and worshipped . </s>
<s> Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites
to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David , and of Asaph the
seer . </s>
<s> And they sang praises with gladness , and they bowed their heads
and worshipped . </s>
<s> Then Hezekiah answered and said , Now ye have consecrated
yourselves unto the LORD , come near and bring sacrifices and thank
offerings into the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> And the congregation brought in
sacrifices and thank offerings ; and as many as were of a free heart
burnt offerings . </s>
<s> And the number of the burnt offerings , which the congregation
brought , was threescore and ten bullocks , an hundred rams , and two
hundred lambs : all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD . </s>
<s> And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
thousand sheep . </s>
<s> But the priests were too few , so that they could not flay all
the burnt offerings : wherefore their brethren the Levites did help
them , till the work was ended , and until the other priests had
sanctified themselves : for the Levites were more upright in heart to
sanctify themselves than the priests . </s>
<s> And also the burnt offerings were in abundance , with the fat of
the peace offerings , and the drink offerings for every burnt offering . </s>
<s> the service of the house of the LORD was set in order . </s>
<s> And Hezekiah rejoiced , and all the people , that God had prepared
the people : for the thing was done suddenly . </s>
<s> And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah , and wrote letters also
to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of the
LORD at Jerusalem , to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel . </s>
<s> For the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the
congregation in Jerusalem , to keep the passover in the second month . </s>
<s> For they could not keep it at that time , because the priests had
not sanctified themselves sufficiently , neither had the people
gathered themselves together to Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation . </s>
<s> So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all
Israel , from Beersheba even to Dan , that they should come to keep the
passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem : for they had not

<s> So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes

you , that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria . </s>
<s> And be not ye like your fathers , and like your brethren , which
trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers , who therefore gave

<s> Now be ye not stiffnecked , as your fathers were , but yield

<s> For if ye turn again unto the LORD , your brethren and your
children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive , so

<s> So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun : but they laughed them to
scorn , and mocked them . </s>
<s> Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled
themselves , and came to Jerusalem . </s>
<s> Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do
the commandment of the king and of the princes , by the word of the
LORD . </s>
<s> And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
of unleavened bread in the second month , a very great congregation . </s>
<s> And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem ,
and all the altars for incense took they away , and cast them into the
brook Kidron . </s>
<s> Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
second month : and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and
sanctified themselves , and brought in the burnt offerings into the
house of the LORD . </s>
<s> And they stood in their place after their manner , according to
the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood ,
which they received of the hand of the Levites . </s>
<s> For there were many in the congregation that were not
sanctified : therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the
passovers for every one that was not clean , to sanctify them unto the
LORD . </s>
<s> For a multitude of the people , even many of Ephraim , and
Manasseh , Issachar , and Zebulun , had not cleansed themselves , yet did
they eat the passover otherwise than it was written . </s>
<s> But Hezekiah
prayed for them , saying , The good LORD pardon every one That
prepareth his heart to seek God , the LORD God of his fathers , though
he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary . </s>
<s> And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah , and healed the people . </s>
<s> And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness : and the
Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day , singing with loud
instruments unto the LORD . </s>
<s> And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught
the good knowledge of the LORD : and they did eat throughout the feast
seven days , offering peace offerings , and making confession to the
LORD God of their fathers . </s>
<s> And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days :
and they kept other seven days with gladness . </s>
<s> For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to
the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep : and a
great number of priests sanctified themselves . </s>
<s> And all the congregation of Judah , with the priests and the
Levites , and all the congregation that came out of Israel , and the
strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in
Judah , rejoiced . </s>
<s> So there was great joy in Jerusalem : for since the time of
Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in
Jerusalem . </s>
<s> Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people : and
their voice was heard , and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling
place , even unto heaven . </s>
<s> Now when all this was finished , all Israel that were present went
out to the cities of Judah , and brake the images in pieces , and cut
down the groves , and threw down the high places and the altars out of
all Judah and Benjamin , in Ephraim also and Manasseh , until they had
utterly destroyed them all . </s>
<s> Then all the children of Israel returned ,
every man to his possession , into their own cities . </s>
<s> And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites
after their courses , every man according to his service , the priests
and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings , to minister ,
and to give thanks , and to praise in the gates of the tents of the
LORD . </s>
<s> He appointed also the king 's portion of his substance for the
burnt offerings , to wit , for the morning and evening burnt offerings ,
and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths , and for the new moons , and
for the set feasts , as it is written in the law of the LORD . </s>
<s> Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give
the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might be
encouraged in the law of the LORD . </s>
<s> And as soon as the commandment came abroad , the children of
Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn , wine , and oil ,
and honey , and of all the increase of the field ; and the tithe of all
things brought they in abundantly . </s>
<s> And concerning the children of Israel and Judah , that dwelt in
the cities of Judah , they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep ,
and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD
their God , and laid them by heaps . </s>
<s> In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps ,
and finished them in the seventh month . </s>
<s> And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps , they
blessed the LORD , and his people Israel . </s>
<s> Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites
concerning the heaps . </s>
<s> And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him ,
and said , Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house
of the LORD , we have had enough to eat , and have left plenty : for the
LORD hath blessed his people ; and that which is left is this great
store . </s>
<s> Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the
LORD ; and they prepared them , And brought in the offerings and
the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully : over which Cononiah
the Levite was ruler , and Shimei his brother was the next . </s>
<s> And Jehiel , and Azaziah , and Nahath , and Asahel , and Jerimoth ,
and Jozabad , and Eliel , and Ismachiah , and Mahath , and Benaiah , were
overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother , at the
commandment of Hezekiah the king , and Azariah the ruler of the house
of God . </s>
<s> And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite , the porter toward the
east , was over the freewill offerings of God , to distribute the
oblations of the LORD , and the most holy things . </s>
<s> And next him were Eden , and Miniamin , and Jeshua , and Shemaiah ,
Amariah , and Shecaniah , in the cities of the priests , in their set
office , to give to their brethren by courses , as well to the great as
to the small : Beside their genealogy of males , from three years
old and upward , even unto every one that entereth into the house of
the LORD , his daily portion for their service in their charges
according to their courses ; Both to the genealogy of the priests
by the house of their fathers , and the Levites from twenty years old
and upward , in their charges by their courses ; And to the
genealogy of all their little ones , their wives , and their sons , and
their daughters , through all the congregation : for in their set office
they sanctified themselves in holiness : Also of the sons of
Aaron the priests , which were in the fields of the suburbs of their
cities , in every several city , the men that were expressed by name , to
give portions to all the males among the priests , and to all that were
reckoned by genealogies among the Levites . </s>
<s> And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah , and wrought that
which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God . </s>
<s> And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
God , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did
it with all his heart , and prospered . </s>
<s> After these things , and the establishment thereof , Sennacherib
king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the
fenced cities , and thought to win them for himself . </s>
<s> And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come , and that he was
purposed to fight against Jerusalem , He took counsel with his
princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which
were without the city : and they did help him . </s>
<s> So there was gathered much people together , who stopped all the
fountains , and the brook that ran through the midst of the land ,
saying , Why should the kings of Assyria come , and find much water ? </s>
<s> Also he strengthened himself , and built up all the wall that was
broken , and raised it up to the towers , and another wall without , and
repaired Millo in the city of David , and made darts and shields in
abundance . </s>
<s> And he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them
together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and spake
comfortably to them , saying , Be strong and courageous , be not
afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria , nor for all the multitude
that is with him : for there be more with us than with him : With
him is an arm of flesh ; but with us is the LORD our God to help us ,
and to fight our battles . </s>
<s> And the people rested themselves upon the
words of Hezekiah king of Judah . </s>
<s> After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to
Jerusalem , (but he himself laid siege against Lachish , and all his
power with him ,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah , and unto all Judah that
were at Jerusalem , saying , Thus saith Sennacherib king of
Assyria , Whereon do ye trust , that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem ? </s>
<s> Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by
famine and by thirst , saying , The LORD our God shall deliver us out of
the hand of the king of Assyria ? </s>
<s>  Hath not the same Hezekiah
taken away his high places and his altars , and commanded Judah and
Jerusalem , saying , Ye shall worship before one altar , and burn incense
upon it ? </s>
<s>  Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all
the people of other lands ? </s>
<s> were the gods of the nations of those lands
any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ? </s>
<s>  Who was
there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly
destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your
God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ? </s>
<s>  Now
therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you , nor persuade you on this
manner , neither yet believe him : for no god of any nation or kingdom
was able to deliver his people out of mine hand , and out of the hand
of my fathers : how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine
hand ? </s>
<s>  And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God , and
against his servant Hezekiah . </s>
<s> He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel , and to
speak against him , saying , As the gods of the nations of other lands
have not delivered their people out of mine hand , so shall not the God
of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand . </s>
<s> Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' speech unto the
people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to affright them , and to
trouble them ; that they might take the city . </s>
<s> And they spake against the God of Jerusalem , as against the gods
of the people of the earth , which were the work of the hands of man . </s>
<s> And for this cause Hezekiah the king , and the prophet Isaiah the
son of Amoz , prayed and cried to heaven . </s>
<s> And the LORD sent an angel , which cut off all the mighty men of
valour , and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of
Assyria . </s>
<s> So he returned with shame of face to his own land . </s>
<s> And when
he was come into the house of his god , they that came forth of his own
bowels slew him there with the sword . </s>
<s> Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of
all other , and guided them on every side . </s>
<s> And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem , and presents
to Hezekiah king of Judah : so that he was magnified in the sight of
all nations from thenceforth . </s>
<s> In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death , and prayed unto
the LORD : and he spake unto him , and he gave him a sign . </s>
<s> But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
unto him ; for his heart was lifted up : therefore there was wrath upon
him , and upon Judah and Jerusalem . </s>
<s> Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of
the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah . </s>
<s> And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour : and he made
himself treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones ,
and for spices , and for shields , and for all manner of pleasant
jewels ; Storehouses also for the increase of corn , and wine , and
oil ; and stalls for all manner of beasts , and cotes for flocks . </s>
<s> Moreover he provided him cities , and possessions of flocks and
herds in abundance : for God had given him substance very much . </s>
<s> This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon ,
and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David . </s>
<s> Hezekiah prospered in all his works . </s>
<s> Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
Babylon , who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in
the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in
his heart . </s>
<s> Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and his goodness , behold ,
they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz ,
and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel . </s>
<s> And Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the
chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David : and all Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death . </s>
<s> And Manasseh his
son reigned in his stead . </s>
<s> Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign , and he
reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem : But did that which was
evil in the sight of the LORD , like unto the abominations of the
heathen , whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel . </s>
<s> For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had
broken down , and he reared up altars for Baalim , and made groves , and
worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them . </s>
<s> Also he built altars in the house of the LORD , whereof the LORD
had said , In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever . </s>
<s> And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
of the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley
of the son of Hinnom : also he observed times , and used enchantments ,
and used witchcraft , and dealt with a familiar spirit , and with
wizards : he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him
to anger . </s>
<s> And he set a carved image , the idol which he had made , in the
house of God , of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son ,
In this house , and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen before all the
tribes of Israel , will I put my name for ever : Neither will I any
more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have
appointed for your fathers ; so that they will take heed to do all that
I have commanded them , according to the whole law and the statutes and
the ordinances by the hand of Moses . </s>
<s> So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err ,
and to do worse than the heathen , whom the LORD had destroyed before
the children of Israel . </s>
<s> And the LORD spake to Manasseh , and to his people : but they
would not hearken . </s>
<s> Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of
the king of Assyria , which took Manasseh among the thorns , and bound
him with fetters , and carried him to Babylon . </s>
<s> And when he was in affliction , he besought the LORD his God , and
humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers , And
prayed unto him : and he was intreated of him , and heard his
supplication , and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom . </s>
<s> Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God . </s>
<s> Now after this he built a wall without the city of David , on the
west side of Gihon , in the valley , even to the entering in at the fish
gate , and compassed about Ophel , and raised it up a very great height ,
and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah . </s>
<s> And he took away the strange gods , and the idol out of the house
of the LORD , and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the
house of the LORD , and in Jerusalem , and cast them out of the city . </s>
<s> And he repaired the altar of the LORD , and sacrificed thereon
peace offerings and thank offerings , and commanded Judah to serve the
LORD God of Israel . </s>
<s> Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places ,
yet unto the LORD their God only . </s>
<s> Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and his prayer unto his
God , and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the
LORD God of Israel , behold , they are written in the book of the kings
of Israel . </s>
<s> His prayer also , and how God was intreated of him , and all his
sins , and his trespass , and the places wherein he built high places ,
and set up groves and graven images , before he was humbled : behold ,
they are written among the sayings of the seers . </s>
<s> So Manasseh slept with his fathers , and they buried him in his
own house : and Amon his son reigned in his stead . </s>
<s> Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign , and
reigned two years in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as did
Manasseh his father : for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images
which Manasseh his father had made , and served them ; And humbled
not himself before the LORD , as Manasseh his father had humbled
himself ; but Amon trespassed more and more . </s>
<s> And his servants conspired against him , and slew him in his own
house . </s>
<s> But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king
in his stead . </s>
<s> Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he reigned
in Jerusalem one and thirty years . </s>
<s> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and
walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the
right hand , nor to the left . </s>
<s> For in the eighth year of his reign , while he was yet young , he
began to seek after the God of David his father : and in the twelfth
year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places , and
the groves , and the carved images , and the molten images . </s>
<s> And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence ; and the
images , that were on high above them , he cut down ; and the groves , and
the carved images , and the molten images , he brake in pieces , and made
dust of them , and strowed it upon the graves of them that had
sacrificed unto them . </s>
<s> And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars , and
cleansed Judah and Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And so did he in the cities of Manasseh , and Ephraim , and Simeon ,
even unto Naphtali , with their mattocks round about . </s>
<s> And when he had broken down the altars and the groves , and had
beaten the graven images into powder , and cut down all the idols
throughout all the land of Israel , he returned to Jerusalem . </s>
<s> Now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the
land , and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah
the governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder , to
repair the house of the LORD his God . </s>
<s> And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest , they delivered the
money that was brought into the house of God , which the Levites that
kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim , and
of all the remnant of Israel , and of all Judah and Benjamin ; and they
returned to Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
oversight of the house of the LORD , and they gave it to the workmen

stone , and timber for couplings , and to floor the houses which the
kings of Judah had destroyed . </s>
<s> And the men did the work faithfully : and the overseers of them

of musick . </s>
<s> Also they were over the bearers of burdens , and were overseers

house of the LORD , Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the
LORD given by Moses . </s>

delivered the book to Shaphan . </s>

word back again , saying , All that was committed to thy servants , they

<s> And Hilkiah , and they that the king had appointed , went to

<s> And as for the king of Judah , who sent you to enquire of the

the valley of Megiddo . </s>
<s> And the archers shot at king Josiah ; and the king said to his
servants , Have me away ; for I am sore wounded . </s>
<s> His servants therefore took him out of that chariot , and put him

seventy males . </s>
<s> And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava ;
and there abode we in tents three days : and I viewed the people , and
the priests , and found there none of the sons of Levi . </s>
<s> Then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for
Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for

<s> And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place

unto us ministers for the house of our God . </s>
<s> And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of

brethren and their sons , twenty ; Also of the Nethinims , whom
David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites ,
two hundred and twenty Nethinims : all of them were expressed by name . </s>
<s> Then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river of Ahava , that we
might afflict ourselves before our God , to seek of him a right way for
us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance . </s>
<s> For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and
horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way : because we had
spoken unto the king , saying , The hand of our God is upon all them for
good that seek him ; but his power and his wrath is against all them
that forsake him . </s>
<s> So we fasted and besought our God for this : and he was intreated
of us . </s>
<s> Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests , Sherebiah ,
Hashabiah , and ten of their brethren with them , And weighed unto
them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering of
the house of our God , which the king , and his counsellors , and his
lords , and all Israel there present , had offered : I even weighed
unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver , and silver
vessels an hundred talents , and of gold an hundred talents ; Also
twenty basons of gold , of a thousand drams ; and two vessels of fine
copper , precious as gold . </s>
<s> And I said unto them , Ye are holy unto the LORD ; the vessels are
holy also ; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto
the LORD God of your fathers . </s>
<s> Watch ye , and keep them , until ye weigh them before the chief of
the priests and the Levites , and chief of the fathers of Israel , at
Jerusalem , in the chambers of the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver , and
the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house
of our God . </s>
<s> Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of
the first month , to go unto Jerusalem : and the hand of our God was
upon us , and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy , and of such
as lay in wait by the way . </s>
<s> And we came to Jerusalem , and abode there three days . </s>
<s> Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels
weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of
Uriah the priest ; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas ; and
with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua , and Noadiah the son of
Binnui , Levites ; By number and by weight of every one : and all
the weight was written at that time . </s>
<s> Also the children of those that had been carried away , which were
come out of the captivity , offered burnt offerings unto the God of
Israel , twelve bullocks for all Israel , ninety and six rams , seventy
and seven lambs , twelve he goats for a sin offering : all this was a
burnt offering unto the LORD . </s>
<s> And they delivered the king 's commissions unto the king 's
lieutenants , and to the governors on this side the river : and they
furthered the people , and the house of God . </s>
<s> Now when these things were done , the princes came to me , saying ,

separated themselves from the people of the lands , doing according to
their abominations , even of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the
Perizzites , the Jebusites , the Ammonites , the Moabites , the Egyptians ,

<s> For they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for
their sons : so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the
people of those lands : yea , the hand of the princes and rulers hath
been chief in this trespass . </s>
<s> And when I heard this thing , I rent my garment and my mantle , and
plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down
astonied . </s>
<s> Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words
of the God of Israel , because of the transgression of those that had
been carried away ; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice . </s>
<s> And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness ; and
having rent my garment and my mantle , I fell upon my knees , and spread
out my hands unto the LORD my God , 9 :6 And said , O my God , I am
ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee , my God : for our
iniquities are increased over our head , and our trespass is grown up
unto the heavens . </s>
<s> Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass
unto this day ; and for our iniquities have we , our kings , and our
priests , been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands , to
the sword , to captivity , and to a spoil , and to confusion of face , as
it is this day . </s>
<s> And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD
our God , to leave us a remnant to escape , and to give us a nail in his
holy place , that our God may lighten our eyes , and give us a little
reviving in our bondage . </s>
<s> For we were bondmen ; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our
bondage , but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of
Persia , to give us a reviving , to set up the house of our God , and to
repair the desolations thereof , and to give us a wall in Judah and in
Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And now , O our God , what shall we say after this ? </s>
<s> for we have
forsaken thy commandments , Which thou hast commanded by thy
servants the prophets , saying , The land , unto which ye go to possess
it , is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands ,
with their abominations , which have filled it from one end to another
with their uncleanness . </s>
<s> Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons , neither
take their daughters unto your sons , nor seek their peace or their
wealth for ever : that ye may be strong , and eat the good of the land ,
and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever . </s>
<s> And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds , and for
our great trespass , seeing that thou our God hast punished us less
than our iniquities deserve , and hast given us such deliverance as
this ; Should we again break thy commandments , and join in
affinity with the people of these abominations ? </s>
<s> wouldest not thou be
angry with us till thou hadst consumed us , so that there should be no
remnant nor escaping ? </s>
<s>  O LORD God of Israel , thou art righteous :
for we remain yet escaped , as it is this day : behold , we are before
thee in our trespasses : for we cannot stand before thee because of
this . </s>
<s> Now when Ezra had prayed , and when he had confessed , weeping and
casting himself down before the house of God , there assembled unto him
out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children :
for the people wept very sore . </s>
<s> And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam ,
answered and said unto Ezra , We have trespassed against our God , and
have taken strange wives of the people of the land : yet now there is
hope in Israel concerning this thing . </s>
<s> Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all
the wives , and such as are born of them , according to the counsel of
my lord , and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God ; and
let it be done according to the law . </s>
<s> Arise ; for this matter belongeth unto thee : we also will be with
thee : be of good courage , and do it . </s>
<s> Then arose Ezra , and made the chief priests , the Levites , and all
Israel , to swear that they should do according to this word . </s>
<s> And they
sware . </s>
<s> Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God , and went into the
chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib : and when he came thither , he
did eat no bread , nor drink water : for he mourned because of the
transgression of them that had been carried away . </s>
<s> And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto
all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves
together unto Jerusalem ; And that whosoever would not come within
three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders ,

congregation of those that had been carried away . </s>
<s> Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves
together unto Jerusalem within three days . </s>
<s> It was the ninth month , on
the twentieth day of the month ; and all the people sat in the street
of the house of God , trembling because of this matter , and for the
great rain . </s>
<s> And Ezra the priest stood up , and said unto them , Ye have
transgressed , and have taken strange wives , to increase the trespass
of Israel . </s>
<s> Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers ,
and do his pleasure : and separate yourselves from the people of the
land , and from the strange wives . </s>
<s> Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice ,
As thou hast said , so must we do . </s>
<s> But the people are many , and it is a time of much rain , and we
are not able to stand without , neither is this a work of one day or
two : for we are many that have transgressed in this thing . </s>
<s> Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand , and let all
them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed
times , and with them the elders of every city , and the judges thereof ,

<s> And it came to pass
in the month Chisleu , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the
palace , 1 :2 That Hanani , one of my brethren , came , he and certain men
of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which
were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And they said unto me , The remnant that are left of the captivity
there in the province are in great affliction and reproach : the wall
of Jerusalem also is broken down , and the gates thereof are burned
with fire . </s>
<s> And it came to pass , when I heard these words , that I sat down and
wept , and mourned certain days , and fasted , and prayed before the God
of heaven , 1 :5 And said , I beseech thee , O LORD God of heaven , the
great and terrible God , that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that
love him and observe his commandments : 1 :6 Let thine ear now be
attentive , and thine eyes open , that thou mayest hear the prayer of
thy servant , which I pray before thee now , day and night , for the
children of Israel thy servants , and confess the sins of the children
of Israel , which we have sinned against thee : both I and my father 's
house have sinned . </s>
<s> We have dealt very corruptly against thee , and have not kept the
commandments , nor the statutes , nor the judgments , which thou
commandedst thy servant Moses . </s>
<s> Remember , I beseech thee , the word that thou commandedst thy
servant Moses , saying , If ye transgress , I will scatter you abroad
among the nations : 1 :9 But if ye turn unto me , and keep my
commandments , and do them ; though there were of you cast out unto the
uttermost part of the heaven , yet will I gather them from thence , and
will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name
there . </s>
<s> Now these are thy servants and thy people , whom thou hast
redeemed by thy great power , and by thy strong hand . </s>
<s> O LORD , I beseech thee , let now thine ear be attentive to the
prayer of thy servant , and to the prayer of thy servants , who desire
to fear thy name : and prosper , I pray thee , thy servant this day , and
grant him mercy in the sight of this man . </s>
<s> For I was the king 's
cupbearer . </s>
<s> And it came to pass in the month Nisan , in the twentieth year of
Artaxerxes the king , that wine was before him : and I took up the wine ,
and gave it unto the king . </s>
<s> Now I had not been beforetime sad in his
presence . </s>
<s> Wherefore the king said unto me , Why is thy countenance sad ,
seeing thou art not sick ? </s>
<s> this is nothing else but sorrow of heart . </s>
<s> I was very sore afraid , 2 :3 And said unto the king , Let the king
live for ever : why should not my countenance be sad , when the city ,
the place of my fathers ' sepulchres , lieth waste , and the gates
thereof are consumed with fire ? </s>
<s> 2 :4 Then the king said unto me , For
what dost thou make request ? </s>
<s> So I prayed to the God of heaven . </s>
<s> And I said unto the king , If it please the king , and if thy
servant have found favour in thy sight , that thou wouldest send me
unto Judah , unto the city of my fathers ' sepulchres , that I may build
it . </s>

how long shall thy journey be ? </s>

<s> So it
pleased the king to send me ; and I set him a time . </s>
<s> Moreover I said unto the king , If it please the king , let letters
be given me to the governors beyond the river , that they may convey me
over till I come into Judah ; 2 :8 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of
the king 's forest , that he may give me timber to make beams for the
gates of the palace which appertained to the house , and for the wall
of the city , and for the house that I shall enter into . </s>

granted me , according to the good hand of my God upon me . </s>

horsemen with me . </s>
<s> When Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobiah the servant , the
Ammonite , heard of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come
a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel . </s>
<s> So I came to Jerusalem , and was there three days . </s>
<s> And I arose in the night , I and some few men with me ; neither
told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem :

<s> And I went out by night by the gate of the valley , even before
the dragon well , and to the dung port , and viewed the walls of
Jerusalem , which were broken down , and the gates thereof were consumed
with fire . </s>
<s> Then I went on to the gate of the fountain , and to the king 's
pool : but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass . </s>
<s> Then went I up in the night by the brook , and viewed the wall ,

returned . </s>
<s> And the rulers knew not whither I went , or what I did ; neither
had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the
nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest that did the work . </s>
<s> Then said I unto them , Ye see the distress that we are in , how
Jerusalem lieth waste , and the gates thereof are burned with fire :
come , and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we be no more a
reproach . </s>
<s> Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me ; as
also the king 's words that he had spoken unto me . </s>
<s> And they said , Let
us rise up and build . </s>
<s> So they strengthened their hands for this good
work . </s>

Ammonite , and Geshem the Arabian , heard it , they laughed us to scorn ,

<s> And I looked , and rose up , and said unto the nobles , and to the
rulers , and to the rest of the people , Be not ye afraid of them :
remember the LORD , which is great and terrible , and fight for your
brethren , your sons , and your daughters , your wives , and your houses . </s>
<s> And it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known
unto us , and God had brought their counsel to nought , that we returned
all of us to the wall , every one unto his work . </s>
<s> And it came to pass from that time forth , that the half of my
servants wrought in the work , and the other half of them held both the
spears , the shields , and the bows , and the habergeons ; and the rulers
were behind all the house of Judah . </s>
<s> They which builded on the wall , and they that bare burdens , with
those that laded , every one with one of his hands wrought in the work ,
and with the other hand held a weapon . </s>
<s> For the builders , every one had his sword girded by his side , and
so builded . </s>
<s> And he that sounded the trumpet was by me . </s>
<s> And I said unto the nobles , and to the rulers , and to the rest of
the people , The work is great and large , and we are separated upon the
wall , one far from another . </s>
<s> In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet , resort
ye thither unto us : our God shall fight for us . </s>
<s> So we laboured in the work : and half of them held the spears from
the rising of the morning till the stars appeared . </s>
<s> Likewise at the same time said I unto the people , Let every one
with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be
a guard to us , and labour on the day . </s>
<s> So neither I , nor my brethren , nor my servants , nor the men of
the guard which followed me , none of us put off our clothes , saving
that every one put them off for washing . </s>
<s> And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against
their brethren the Jews . </s>
<s> For there were that said , We , our sons , and our daughters , are
many : therefore we take up corn for them , that we may eat , and live . </s>
<s> Some also there were that said , We have mortgaged our lands ,
vineyards , and houses , that we might buy corn , because of the dearth . </s>
<s> There were also that said , We have borrowed money for the king 's
tribute , and that upon our lands and vineyards . </s>
<s> Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren , our children as
their children : and , lo , we bring into bondage our sons and our
daughters to be servants , and some of our daughters are brought unto
bondage already : neither is it in our power to redeem them ; for other
men have our lands and vineyards . </s>
<s> And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words . </s>
<s> Then I consulted with myself , and I rebuked the nobles , and the
rulers , and said unto them , Ye exact usury , every one of his brother . </s>
<s> I set a great assembly against them . </s>
<s> And I said unto them , We after our ability have redeemed our
brethren the Jews , which were sold unto the heathen ; and will ye even
sell your brethren ? </s>
<s> or shall they be sold unto us ? </s>
<s> Then held they
their peace , and found nothing to answer . </s>
<s> Also I said , It is not good that ye do : ought ye not to walk in
the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our
enemies ? </s>
<s>  I likewise , and my brethren , and my servants , might
exact of them money and corn : I pray you , let us leave off this usury . </s>
<s> Restore , I pray you , to them , even this day , their lands , their
vineyards , their oliveyards , and their houses , also the hundredth part
of the money , and of the corn , the wine , and the oil , that ye exact of
them . </s>
<s> Then said they , We will restore them , and will require nothing of
them ; so will we do as thou sayest . </s>
<s> Then I called the priests , and
took an oath of them , that they should do according to this promise . </s>
<s> Also I shook my lap , and said , So God shake out every man from
his house , and from his labour , that performeth not this promise , even
thus be he shaken out , and emptied . </s>
<s> And all the congregation said ,
Amen , and praised the LORD . </s>
<s> And the people did according to this
promise . </s>
<s> Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor
in the land of Judah , from the twentieth year even unto the two and
thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king , that is , twelve years , I and my
brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor . </s>
<s> But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable
unto the people , and had taken of them bread and wine , beside forty
shekels of silver ; yea , even their servants bare rule over the people :
but so did not I , because of the fear of God . </s>
<s> Yea , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we
any land : and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work . </s>
<s> Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews
and rulers , beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that
are about us . </s>
<s> Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
choice sheep ; also fowls were prepared for me , and once in ten days
store of all sorts of wine : yet for all this required not I the bread
of the governor , because the bondage was heavy upon this people . </s>
<s> Think upon me , my God , for good , according to all that I have
done for this people . </s>
<s> Now it came to pass when Sanballat , and Tobiah , and Geshem the
Arabian , and the rest of our enemies , heard that I had builded the
wall , and that there was no breach left therein ; (though at that time
I had not set up the doors upon the gates ;) 6 :2 That Sanballat and
Geshem sent unto me , saying , Come , let us meet together in some one of
the villages in the plain of Ono . </s>
<s> But they thought to do me mischief . </s>
<s> And I sent messengers unto them , saying , I am doing a great work ,
so that I cannot come down : why should the work cease , whilst I leave
it , and come down to you ? </s>
<s> 6 :4 Yet they sent unto me four times after
this sort ; and I answered them after the same manner . </s>
<s> Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth
time with an open letter in his hand ; 6 :6 Wherein was written , It is
reported among the heathen , and Gashmu saith it , that thou and the
Jews think to rebel : for which cause thou buildest the wall , that thou
mayest be their king , according to these words . </s>
<s> And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
Jerusalem , saying , There is a king in Judah : and now shall it be
reported to the king according to these words . </s>
<s> Come now therefore , and
let us take counsel together . </s>
<s> Then I sent unto him , saying , There are no such things done as
thou sayest , but thou feignest them out of thine own heart . </s>
<s> For they all made us afraid , saying , Their hands shall be weakened
from the work , that it be not done . </s>
<s> Now therefore , O God , strengthen
my hands . </s>
<s> Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah
the son of Mehetabeel , who was shut up ; and he said , Let us meet
together in the house of God , within the temple , and let us shut the
doors of the temple : for they will come to slay thee ; yea , in the
night will they come to slay thee . </s>
<s> And I said , Should such a man as I flee ? </s>
<s> and who is there , that ,
being as I am , would go into the temple to save his life ? </s>
<s> I will not
go in . </s>
<s> And , lo , I perceived that God had not sent him ; but that he
pronounced this prophecy against me : for Tobiah and Sanballat had
hired him . </s>
<s> Therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and
sin , and that they might have matter for an evil report , that they
might reproach me . </s>
<s> My God , think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these
their works , and on the prophetess Noadiah , and the rest of the
prophets , that would have put me in fear . </s>
<s> So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month
Elul , in fifty and two days . </s>
<s> And it came to pass , that when all our enemies heard thereof , and
all the heathen that were about us saw these things , they were much
cast down in their own eyes : for they perceived that this work was
wrought of our God . </s>
<s> Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto
Tobiah , and the letters of Tobiah came unto them . </s>
<s> For there were many in Judah sworn unto him , because he was the
son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah ; and his son Johanan had
taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah . </s>
<s> Also they reported his good deeds before me , and uttered my words
to him . </s>
<s> And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear . </s>
<s> Now it came to pass , when the wall was built , and I had set up the
doors , and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed ,
7 :2 That I gave my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the ruler of the
palace , charge over Jerusalem : for he was a faithful man , and feared
God above many . </s>
<s> And I said unto them , Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened
until the sun be hot ; and while they stand by , let them shut the
doors , and bar them : and appoint watches of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem , every one in his watch , and every one to be over against
his house . </s>
<s> Now the city was large and great : but the people were few therein ,
and the houses were not builded . </s>
<s> And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles , and
the rulers , and the people , that they might be reckoned by genealogy . </s>

priests and for the Levites that waited . </s>

<s> And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel , and in the days of

<s> On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the

but hired Balaam against them , that he should curse them : howbeit our
God turned the curse into a blessing . </s>

separated from Israel all the mixed multitude . </s>

the corn , the new wine , and the oil , which was commanded to be given
to the Levites , and the singers , and the porters ; and the offerings of
the priests . </s>
<s> But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem : for in the two and
thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king , and
after certain days obtained I leave of the king : And I came to
Jerusalem , and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah , in
preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God . </s>
<s> And it grieved me sore : therefore I cast forth all the household
stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber . </s>
<s> Then I commanded , and they cleansed the chambers : and thither
brought I again the vessels of the house of God , with the meat
offering and the frankincense . </s>
<s> And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
given them : for the Levites and the singers , that did the work , were
fled every one to his field . </s>
<s> Then contended I with the rulers , and said , Why is the house of
God forsaken ? </s>
<s> And I gathered them together , and set them in their
place . </s>
<s> Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine
and the oil unto the treasuries . </s>
<s> And I made treasurers over the treasuries , Shelemiah the priest ,

counted faithful , and their office was to distribute unto their
brethren . </s>
<s> Remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good
deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices
thereof . </s>
<s> In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the
sabbath , and bringing in sheaves , and lading asses ; as also wine ,
grapes , and figs , and all manner of burdens , which they brought into
Jerusalem on the sabbath day : and I testified against them in the day
wherein they sold victuals . </s>
<s> There dwelt men of Tyre also therein , which brought fish , and
all manner of ware , and sold on the sabbath unto the children of
Judah , and in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> Then I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said unto them ,

<s> Did not your fathers thus , and did not our God bring all this
evil upon us , and upon this city ? </s>
<s> yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel
by profaning the sabbath . </s>
<s> And it came to pass , that when the gates of Jerusalem began to
be dark before the sabbath , I commanded that the gates should be shut ,
and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath : and
some of my servants set I at the gates , that there should no burden be
brought in on the sabbath day . </s>
<s> So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without
Jerusalem once or twice . </s>
<s> Then I testified against them , and said unto them , Why lodge ye
about the wall ? </s>
<s> if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . </s>
<s> From that
time forth came they no more on the sabbath . </s>
<s> And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves ,
and that they should come and keep the gates , to sanctify the sabbath
day . </s>
<s> me , O my God , concerning this also , and spare me according to
the greatness of thy mercy . </s>
<s> In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod ,
of Ammon , and of Moab : And their children spake half in the
speech of Ashdod , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but
according to the language of each people . </s>
<s> And I contended with them , and cursed them , and smote certain of
them , and plucked off their hair , and made them swear by God , saying ,
Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons , nor take their
daughters unto your sons , or for yourselves . </s>
<s> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things ? </s>
<s> yet among
many nations was there no king like him , who was beloved of his God ,
and God made him king over all Israel : nevertheless even him did
outlandish women cause to sin . </s>
<s> Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil , to
transgress against our God in marrying strange wives ? </s>
<s>  And one
of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son in
law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me . </s>
<s> Remember them , O my God , because they have defiled the
priesthood , and the covenant of the priesthood , and of the Levites . </s>

1 :1 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus , (this is Ahasuerus
which reigned , from India even unto Ethiopia , over an hundred and
seven and twenty provinces :) 1 :2 That in those days , when the king
Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the
palace , 1 :3 In the third year of his reign , he made a feast unto all
his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the
nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him : 1 :4 When he
shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his
excellent majesty many days , even an hundred and fourscore days . </s>
<s> And when these days were expired , the king made a feast unto all
the people that were present in Shushan the palace , both unto great
and small , seven days , in the court of the garden of the king 's
palace ; 1 :6 Where were white , green , and blue , hangings , fastened with
cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble :
the beds were of gold and silver , upon a pavement of red , and blue ,
and white , and black , marble . </s>
<s> And they gave them drink in vessels of gold , (the vessels being
diverse one from another ,) and royal wine in abundance , according to
the state of the king . </s>
<s> And the drinking was according to the law ; none did compel : for so
the king had appointed to all the officers of his house , that they
should do according to every man 's pleasure . </s>
<s> Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
house which belonged to king Ahasuerus . </s>
<s> On the seventh day , when the heart of the king was merry with
wine , he commanded Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , and Abagtha ,
Zethar , and Carcas , the seven chamberlains that served in the presence
of Ahasuerus the king , To bring Vashti the queen before the king
with the crown royal , to shew the people and the princes her beauty :
for she was fair to look on . </s>
<s> But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king 's commandment by
his chamberlains : therefore was the king very wroth , and his anger
burned in him . </s>
<s> Then the king said to the wise men , which knew the times , (for so
was the king 's manner toward all that knew law and judgment : And
the next unto him was Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres ,
Marsena , and Memucan , the seven princes of Persia and Media , which saw
the king 's face , and which sat the first in the kingdom ;) What
shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law , because she hath
not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the
chamberlains ? </s>
<s>  And Memucan answered before the king and the
princes , Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only , but
also to all the princes , and to all the people that are in all the
provinces of the king Ahasuerus . </s>
<s> For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women , so
that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes , when it shall be
reported , The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought
in before him , but she came not . </s>
<s> Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto
all the king 's princes , which have heard of the deed of the queen . </s>
<s> shall there arise too much contempt and wrath . </s>
<s> If it please the king , let there go a royal commandment from him ,
and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes ,
that it be not altered , That Vashti come no more before king
Ahasuerus ; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is
better than she . </s>
<s> And when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published
throughout all his empire , (for it is great ,) all the wives shall give
to their husbands honour , both to great and small . </s>
<s> And the saying pleased the king and the princes ; and the king did
according to the word of Memucan : For he sent letters into all
the king 's provinces , into every province according to the writing
thereof , and to every people after their language , that every man
should bear rule in his own house , and that it should be published
according to the language of every people . </s>
<s> After these things , when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased ,
he remembered Vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed
against her . </s>
<s> Then said the king 's servants that ministered unto him , Let there
be fair young virgins sought for the king : 2 :3 And let the king
appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom , that they may
gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace , to
the house of the women , unto the custody of Hege the king 's
chamberlain , keeper of the women ; and let their things for
purification be given them : 2 :4 And let the maiden which pleaseth the
king be queen instead of Vashti . </s>
<s> the thing pleased the king ; and he did so . </s>
<s> Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew , whose name was
Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a
Benjamite ; 2 :6 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the
captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah ,
whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away . </s>
<s> And he brought up Hadassah , that is , Esther , his uncle 's daughter :
for she had neither father nor mother , and the maid was fair and
beautiful ; whom Mordecai , when her father and mother were dead , took
for his own daughter . </s>
<s> So it came to pass , when the king 's commandment and his decree was
heard , and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the
palace , to the custody of Hegai , that Esther was brought also unto the
king 's house , to the custody of Hegai , keeper of the women . </s>
<s> And the maiden pleased him , and she obtained kindness of him ; and
he speedily gave her her things for purification , with such things as
belonged to her , and seven maidens , which were meet to be given her ,
out of the king 's house : and he preferred her and her maids unto the
best place of the house of the women . </s>
<s> Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred : for Mordecai
had charged her that she should not shew it . </s>
<s> And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women 's
house , to know how Esther did , and what should become of her . </s>
<s> Now when every maid 's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus ,
after that she had been twelve months , according to the manner of the
women , (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished , to
wit , six months with oil of myrrh , and six months with sweet odours ,
and with other things for the purifying of the women ;) Then thus
came every maiden unto the king ; whatsoever she desired was given her
to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king 's house . </s>
<s> In the evening she went , and on the morrow she returned into the
second house of the women , to the custody of Shaashgaz , the king 's
chamberlain , which kept the concubines : she came in unto the king no
more , except the king delighted in her , and that she were called by
name . </s>
<s> Now when the turn of Esther , the daughter of Abihail the uncle of
Mordecai , who had taken her for his daughter , was come to go in unto
the king , she required nothing but what Hegai the king 's chamberlain ,
the keeper of the women , appointed . </s>
<s> And Esther obtained favour in the
sight of all them that looked upon her . </s>
<s> So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in
the tenth month , which is the month Tebeth , in the seventh year of his
reign . </s>
<s> And the king loved Esther above all the women , and she obtained
grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins ; so that he
set the royal crown upon her head , and made her queen instead of
Vashti . </s>
<s> Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
servants , even Esther 's feast ; and he made a release to the provinces ,
and gave gifts , according to the state of the king . </s>
<s> And when the virgins were gathered together the second time , then
Mordecai sat in the king 's gate . </s>
<s> Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people ; as Mordecai
had charged her : for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai , like as
when she was brought up with him . </s>
<s> In those days , while Mordecai sat in the king 's gate , two of the
king 's chamberlains , Bigthan and Teresh , of those which kept the door ,
were wroth , and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus . </s>
<s> And the thing was known to Mordecai , who told it unto Esther the
queen ; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai 's name . </s>
<s> And when inquisition was made of the matter , it was found out ;
therefore they were both hanged on a tree : and it was written in the
book of the chronicles before the king . </s>
<s> After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
Hammedatha the Agagite , and advanced him , and set his seat above all
the princes that were with him . </s>
<s> And all the king 's servants , that were in the king 's gate , bowed ,
and reverenced Haman : for the king had so commanded concerning him . </s>
<s> Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence . </s>
<s> Then the king 's servants , which were in the king 's gate , said unto
Mordecai , Why transgressest thou the king 's commandment ? </s>
<s> 3 :4 Now it
came to pass , when they spake daily unto him , and he hearkened not
unto them , that they told Haman , to see whether Mordecai 's matters
would stand : for he had told them that he was a Jew . </s>
<s> And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence ,
then was Haman full of wrath . </s>
<s> And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone ; for they had
shewed him the people of Mordecai : wherefore Haman sought to destroy
all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus , even
the people of Mordecai . </s>
<s> In the first month , that is , the month Nisan , in the twelfth year
of king Ahasuerus , they cast Pur , that is , the lot , before Haman from
day to day , and from month to month , to the twelfth month , that is ,

<s> And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus , There is a certain people
scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces

to suffer them . </s>
<s> If it please the king , let it be written that they may be
destroyed : and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands

king 's treasuries . </s>

the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the Jews ' enemy . </s>
<s> And the king said unto Haman , The silver is given to thee , the
people also , to do with them as it seemeth good to thee . </s>
<s> Then were the king 's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the
first month , and there was written according to all that Haman had
commanded unto the king 's lieutenants , and to the governors that were

province according to the writing thereof , and to every people after
their language ; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written , and
sealed with the king 's ring . </s>
<s> And the letters were sent by posts into all the king 's provinces ,

down to drink ; but the city Shushan was perplexed . </s>

clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst

<s> Then
was the queen exceedingly grieved ; and she sent raiment to clothe
Mordecai , and to take away his sackcloth from him : but he received it
not . </s>
<s> Then called Esther for Hatach , one of the king 's chamberlains ,

treasuries for the Jews , to destroy them . </s>
<s> Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was
given at Shushan to destroy them , to shew it unto Esther , and to
declare it unto her , and to charge her that she should go in unto the
king , to make supplication unto him , and to make request before him
for her people . </s>
<s> And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai . </s>
<s> Again Esther spake unto Hatach , and gave him commandment unto
Mordecai ; All the king 's servants , and the people of the king 's

unto the king into the inner court , who is not called , there is one
law of his to put him to death , except such to whom the king shall
hold out the golden sceptre , that he may live : but I have not been
called to come in unto the king these thirty days . </s>
<s> And they told to Mordecai Esther 's words . </s>
<s> Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther , Think not with thyself
that thou shalt escape in the king 's house , more than all the Jews . </s>
<s> For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time , then shall
there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another
place ; but thou and thy father 's house shall be destroyed : and who
knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this ? </s>
<s> Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer , Go ,
gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan , and fast ye
for me , and neither eat nor drink three days , night or day : I also and
my maidens will fast likewise ; and so will I go in unto the king ,
which is not according to the law : and if I perish , I perish . </s>
<s> So Mordecai went his way , and did according to all that Esther
had commanded him . </s>
<s> Now it came to pass on the third day , that Esther put on her royal
apparel , and stood in the inner court of the king 's house , over
against the king 's house : and the king sat upon his royal throne in
the royal house , over against the gate of the house . </s>
<s> And it was so , when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the
court , that she obtained favour in his sight : and the king held out to
Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand . </s>
<s> So Esther drew near ,
and touched the top of the sceptre . </s>
<s> Then said the king unto her , What wilt thou , queen Esther ? </s>
<s> and
what is thy request ? </s>

<s> And Esther answered , If it seem good unto the king , let the king

<s> Then the king said , Cause Haman to make haste , that he may do as
Esther hath said . </s>
<s> So the king and Haman came to the banquet that
Esther had prepared . </s>

<s> Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart : but

moved for him , he was full of indignation against Mordecai . </s>
<s> Nevertheless Haman refrained himself : and when he came home , he
sent and called for his friends , and Zeresh his wife . </s>
<s> And Haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude
of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him ,

<s> Yet all this availeth me nothing , so long as I see Mordecai the
Jew sitting at the king 's gate . </s>
<s> Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him , Let a
gallows be made of fifty cubits high , and to morrow speak thou unto
the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon : then go thou in merrily
with the king unto the banquet . </s>
<s> And the thing pleased Haman ; and he
caused the gallows to be made . </s>
<s> On that night could not the king sleep , and he commanded to bring
the book of records of the chronicles ; and they were read before the
king . </s>
<s> And it was found written , that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and
Teresh , two of the king 's chamberlains , the keepers of the door , who
sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus . </s>
<s> And the king said , What honour and dignity hath been done to
Mordecai for this ? </s>
<s> Then said the king 's servants that ministered unto
him , There is nothing done for him . </s>
<s> And the king said , Who is in the court ? </s>
<s> Now Haman was come into
the outward court of the king 's house , to speak unto the king to hang
Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him . </s>

the court . </s>
<s> And the king said , Let him come in . </s>
<s> So Haman came in . </s>
<s> And the king said unto him , What shall be done

<s> Now Haman thought in
his heart , To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to

<s> 6 :7 And Haman answered the king , For the man whom the king
delighteth to honour , 6 :8 Let the royal apparel be brought which the
king useth to wear , and the horse that the king rideth upon , and the
crown royal which is set upon his head : 6 :9 And let this apparel and
horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king 's most noble
princes , that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth
to honour , and bring him on horseback through the street of the city ,
and proclaim before him , Thus shall it be done to the man whom the
king delighteth to honour . </s>
<s> Then the king said to Haman , Make haste , and take the apparel and
the horse , as thou hast said , and do even so to Mordecai the Jew , that
sitteth at the king 's gate : let nothing fail of all that thou hast
spoken . </s>
<s> Then took Haman the apparel and the horse , and arrayed Mordecai ,
and brought him on horseback through the street of the city , and
proclaimed before him , Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the
king delighteth to honour . </s>
<s> And Mordecai came again to the king 's gate . </s>
<s> But Haman hasted to
his house mourning , and having his head covered . </s>
<s> And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing
that had befallen him . </s>
<s> Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto
him , If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews , before whom thou hast
begun to fall , thou shalt not prevail against him , but shalt surely
fall before him . </s>
<s> And while they were yet talking with him , came the king 's
chamberlains , and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther
had prepared . </s>
<s> So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen . </s>

banquet of wine , What is thy petition , queen Esther ? </s>

granted thee : and what is thy request ? </s>
<s> and it shall be performed , even
to the half of the kingdom . </s>
<s> Then Esther the queen answered and said , If I have found favour in

<s> But if we
had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen , I had held my tongue ,

<s> And Esther said , The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman . </s>
<s> Haman was afraid before the king and the queen . </s>
<s> And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went
into the palace garden : and Haman stood up to make request for his
life to Esther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined
against him by the king . </s>
<s> Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of
the banquet of wine ; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther
was . </s>
<s> Then said the king , Will he force the queen also before me in the
house ? </s>
<s> As the word went out of king 's mouth , they covered Haman 's
face . </s>
<s> And Harbonah , one of the chamberlains , said before the king ,
Behold also , the gallows fifty cubits high , which Haman had made for
Mordecai , who spoken good for the king , standeth in the house of
Haman . </s>
<s> Then the king said , Hang him thereon . </s>
<s> So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai . </s>
<s> Then was the king 's wrath pacified . </s>
<s> On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the
Jews ' enemy unto Esther the queen . </s>
<s> And Mordecai came before the king ;

<s> And the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Haman , and
gave it unto Mordecai . </s>
<s> And Esther set Mordecai over the house of
Haman . </s>
<s> And Esther spake yet again before the king , and fell down at his
feet , and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman
the Agagite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews . </s>
<s> Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther . </s>
<s> So Esther
arose , and stood before the king , 8 :5 And said , If it please the king ,

wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king 's provinces : 8 :6

<s> how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred ? </s>
<s> 8 :7 Then
the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew ,

hanged upon the gallows , because he laid his hand upon the Jews . </s>
<s> Write ye also for the Jews , as it liketh you , in the king 's name ,

<s> Then were the king 's scribes called at that time in the third

<s> And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus ' name , and sealed it with the
king 's ring , and sent letters by posts on horseback , and riders on
mules , camels , and young dromedaries : Wherein the king granted
the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together , and
to stand for their life , to destroy , to slay and to cause to perish ,
all the power of the people and province that would assault them , both
little ones and women , and to take the spoil of them for a prey , 
Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus , namely , upon the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month Adar . </s>
<s> The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
province was published unto all people , and that the Jews should be
ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies . </s>
<s> So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out , being
hastened and pressed on by the king 's commandment . </s>
<s> And the decree was
given at Shushan the palace . </s>
<s> And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
apparel of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold , and with a

<s> The Jews had light , and gladness , and joy , and honour . </s>
<s> And in every province , and in every city , whithersoever the
king 's commandment and his decree came , the Jews had joy and gladness ,
a feast and a good day . </s>
<s> And many of the people of the land became
Jews ; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them . </s>
<s> Now in the twelfth month , that is , the month Adar , on the
thirteenth day of the same , when the king 's commandment and his decree
drew near to be put in execution , in the day that the enemies of the
Jews hoped to have power over them , (though it was turned to the
contrary , that the Jews had rule over them that hated them ;) 9 :2 The
Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the
provinces of the king Ahasuerus , to lay hand on such as sought their
hurt : and no man could withstand them ; for the fear of them fell upon
all people . </s>
<s> And all the rulers of the provinces , and the lieutenants , and the
deputies , and officers of the king , helped the Jews ; because the fear
of Mordecai fell upon them . </s>
<s> For Mordecai was great in the king 's house , and his fame went out
throughout all the provinces : for this man Mordecai waxed greater and
greater . </s>
<s> Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and did what they would unto
those that hated them . </s>
<s> And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred
men . </s>
<s> And Parshandatha , and Dalphon , and Aspatha , 9 :8 And Poratha , and
Adalia , and Aridatha , 9 :9 And Parmashta , and Arisai , and Aridai , and
Vajezatha , The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha , the enemy
of the Jews , slew they ; but on the spoil laid they not their hand . </s>
<s> On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the
palace was brought before the king . </s>
<s> And the king said unto Esther the queen , The Jews have slain and
destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace , and the ten sons of
Haman ; what have they done in the rest of the king 's provinces ? </s>
<s> now
what is thy petition ? </s>
<s> and it shall be granted thee : or what is thy
request further ? </s>
<s> and it shall be done . </s>
<s> Then said Esther , If it please the king , let it be granted to the
Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this
day 's decree , and let Haman 's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows . </s>
<s> And the king commanded it so to be done : and the decree was given
at Shushan ; and they hanged Haman 's ten sons . </s>
<s> For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on
the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and slew three hundred men
at Shushan ; but on the prey they laid not their hand . </s>
<s> But the other Jews that were in the king 's provinces gathered
themselves together , and stood for their lives , and had rest from
their enemies , and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand , but
they laid not their hands on the prey , On the thirteenth day of
the month Adar ; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they , and
made it a day of feasting and gladness . </s>
<s> But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
thirteenth day thereof , and on the fourteenth thereof ; and on the
fifteenth day of the same they rested , and made it a day of feasting
and gladness . </s>
<s> Therefore the Jews of the villages , that dwelt in the unwalled
towns , made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and
feasting , and a good day , and of sending portions one to another . </s>
<s> And Mordecai wrote these things , and sent letters unto all the
Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus , both nigh

fourteenth day of the month Adar , and the fifteenth day of the same ,
yearly , As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies ,
and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy , and from
mourning into a good day : that they should make them days of feasting
and joy , and of sending portions one to another , and gifts to the
poor . </s>
<s> And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun , and as Mordecai
had written unto them ; Because Haman the son of Hammedatha , the
Agagite , the enemy of all the Jews , had devised against the Jews to
destroy them , and had cast Pur , that is , the lot , to consume them , and
to destroy them ; But when Esther came before the king , he
commanded by letters that his wicked device , which he devised against
the Jews , should return upon his own head , and that he and his sons
should be hanged on the gallows . </s>
<s> Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur . </s>
<s> for all the words of this letter , and of that which they had
seen concerning this matter , and which had come unto them , The
Jews ordained , and took upon them , and upon their seed , and upon all
such as joined themselves unto them , so as it should not fail , that
they would keep these two days according to their writing , and
according to their appointed time every year ; And that these days
should be remembered and kept throughout every generation , every
family , every province , and every city ; and that these days of Purim
should not fail from among the Jews , nor the memorial of them perish
from their seed . </s>
<s> Then Esther the queen , the daughter of Abihail , and Mordecai the
Jew , wrote with all authority , to confirm this second letter of Purim . </s>
<s> And he sent the letters unto all the Jews , to the hundred twenty
and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , with words of peace
and truth , To confirm these days of Purim in their times
appointed , according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had
enjoined them , and as they had decreed for themselves and for their
seed , the matters of the fastings and their cry . </s>
<s> And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim ; and it
was written in the book . </s>
<s> And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land , and upon the
isles of the sea . </s>
<s> And all the acts of his power and of his might , and the
declaration of the greatness of Mordecai , whereunto the king advanced
him , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Media and Persia ? </s>
<s>  For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king
Ahasuerus , and great among the Jews , and accepted of the multitude of
his brethren , seeking the wealth of his people , and speaking peace to
all his seed . </s>

falleth on men , Fear came upon me , and trembling , which made all
my bones to shake . </s>
<s> Then a spirit passed before my face ; the hair of my flesh stood
up : It stood still , but I could not discern the form thereof : an

<s> I would seek unto God , and unto God would I commit my cause : 5 :9

mourn may be exalted to safety . </s>
<s> He disappointeth the devices of the crafty , so that their hands

<s> So the poor hath hope , and iniquity stoppeth her mouth . </s>
<s> Behold , happy is the man whom God correcteth : therefore despise
not thou the chastening of the Almighty : For he maketh sore , and

<s> He shall deliver thee in six troubles : yea , in seven there shall
no evil touch thee . </s>
<s> In famine he shall redeem thee from death : and in war from the
power of the sword . </s>
<s> Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue : neither shalt
thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh . </s>
<s> At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh : neither shalt thou be
afraid of the beasts of the earth . </s>
<s> For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field : and the
beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee . </s>
<s> And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace ; and
thou shalt visit thy habitation , and shalt not sin . </s>

<s> Therefore I will not refrain my mouth ; I will speak in the

<s> Am I a sea , or a whale , that thou settest a watch over me ? </s>
<s> 
When I say , My bed shall comfort me , my couch shall ease my

<s> Though thy beginning was small , yet thy latter end should greatly

<s> For enquire , I pray thee , of the former age , and prepare thyself

<s>  Whilst it is yet in his greenness , and not cut

<s> So are the paths of all that forget God ; and the hypocrite 's hope

<s> Then Job answered and said , 9 :2 I know it is so of a truth : but

<s> 9 :3 If he will contend with him , he

<s>  If God will not withdraw his anger , the

<s> How much less shall I answer him , and choose out my words to

<s>  Whom , though I were righteous , yet would I not
answer , but I would make supplication to my judge . </s>
<s> If I had called , and he had answered me ; yet would I not believe
that he had hearkened unto my voice . </s>
<s> For he breaketh me with a tempest , and multiplieth my wounds

<s> He will not suffer me to take my breath , but filleth me with
bitterness . </s>
<s> If I speak of strength , lo , he is strong : and if of judgment , who
shall set me a time to plead ? </s>
<s>  If I justify myself , mine own

perverse . </s>
<s> Though I were perfect , yet would I not know my soul : I would
despise my life . </s>
<s> This is one thing , therefore I said it , He destroyeth the perfect

<s> If the scourge slay suddenly , he will laugh at the trial of the
innocent . </s>
<s> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked : he covereth the

<s>  Now

<s> They are passed away as the swift ships : as the eagle that

<s> If I say , I will forget my complaint , I will leave off my
heaviness , and comfort myself : I am afraid of all my sorrows , I

<s> If I be wicked , why then labour I in vain ? </s>
<s>  If I wash myself
with snow water , and make my hands never so clean ; Yet shalt thou

<s> Neither is there any daysman betwixt us , that might lay his hand
upon us both . </s>
<s> Let him take his rod away from me , and let not his fear terrify
me : Then would I speak , and not fear him ; but it is not so with
me . </s>
<s> My soul is weary of my life ; I will leave my complaint upon
myself ; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul . </s>
<s> I will say unto God , Do not condemn me ; shew me wherefore thou
contendest with me . </s>
<s> Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress , that thou
shouldest despise the work of thine hands , and shine upon the counsel
of the wicked ? </s>
<s>  Hast thou eyes of flesh ? </s>
<s> or seest thou as man

<s>  Are thy days as the days of man ? </s>
<s> are thy years as man 's

after my sin ? </s>
<s>  Thou knowest that I am not wicked ; and there is
none that can deliver out of thine hand . </s>
<s> Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about ;
yet thou dost destroy me . </s>
<s> Remember , I beseech thee , that thou hast made me as the clay ; and
wilt thou bring me into dust again ? </s>
<s>  Hast thou not poured me out
as milk , and curdled me like cheese ? </s>
<s>  Thou hast clothed me with
skin and flesh , and hast fenced me with bones and sinews . </s>
<s> Thou hast granted me life and favour , and thy visitation hath
preserved my spirit . </s>
<s> And these things hast thou hid in thine heart : I know that this
is with thee . </s>
<s> If I sin , then thou markest me , and thou wilt not acquit me from
mine iniquity . </s>
<s> If I be wicked , woe unto me ; and if I be righteous , yet will I
not lift up my head . </s>
<s> I am full of confusion ; therefore see thou mine
affliction ; For it increaseth . </s>
<s> Thou huntest me as a fierce lion :
and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me . </s>
<s> Thou renewest thy witnesses against me , and increasest thine
indignation upon me ; changes and war are against me . </s>
<s> Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb ? </s>
<s> Oh

<s>  I should

<s> Are not my days few ? </s>
<s> cease then , and let me alone , that I may

<s> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite , and said , Should not

<s> and should a man full of talk be
justified ? </s>
<s>  Should thy lies make men hold their peace ? </s>
<s> and when
thou mockest , shall no man make thee ashamed ? </s>
<s>  For thou hast
said , My doctrine is pure , and I am clean in thine eyes . </s>
<s> But oh that God would speak , and open his lips against thee ; 
And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom , that they are
double to that which is ! </s>
<s> Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less

<s> Canst thou by searching find out God ? </s>
<s> canst thou find out the
Almighty unto perfection ? </s>
<s>  It is as high as heaven ; what canst

<s> deeper than hell ; what canst thou know ? </s>
<s>  The measure

<s> If he cut off , and shut up , or gather together , then who can
hinder him ? </s>
<s>  For he knoweth vain men : he seeth wickedness also ;

<s>  For vain men would be wise ,
though man be born like a wild ass 's colt . </s>
<s> If thou prepare thine heart , and stretch out thine hands toward
him ; If iniquity be in thine hand , put it far away , and let not
wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles . </s>
<s> For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot ; yea , thou
shalt be stedfast , and shalt not fear : Because thou shalt forget
thy misery , and remember it as waters that pass away : And thine
age shall be clearer than the noonday : thou shalt shine forth , thou
shalt be as the morning . </s>
<s> And thou shalt be secure , because there is hope ; yea , thou shalt
dig about thee , and thou shalt take thy rest in safety . </s>
<s> Also thou shalt lie down , and none shall make thee afraid ; yea ,

<s> But the eyes of the wicked shall fail , and they shall not
escape , and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost . </s>
<s> And Job answered and said , No doubt but ye are the people ,

<s> But I have understanding as well as you ; I am not inferior to

<s> But ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the fowls

thee . </s>
<s> Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath

<s>  In whose hand is the soul of every living thing ,

<s> Doth not the ear try words ? </s>

<s> Behold , he breaketh down , and it cannot be built again : he

<s> He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the
earth , and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no

<s> They grope in the dark without light , and he maketh them to

<s> Lo , mine eye hath seen all this , mine ear hath heard and

<s> What ye know , the same do I know also : I am not inferior unto

<s> Hear diligently my speech , and my declaration with your ears . </s>
<s> Behold now , I have ordered my cause ; I know that I shall be
justified . </s>
<s> Who is he that will plead with me ? </s>
<s> for now , if I hold my tongue ,
I shall give up the ghost . </s>
<s> Only do not two things unto me : then will I not hide myself from

<s> Withdraw thine hand far from me : and let not thy dread make me

<s> and wilt thou pursue

<s>  For thou writest bitter things against me , and

<s> Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks , and lookest narrowly
unto all my paths ; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet . </s>
<s> And he , as a rotten thing , consumeth , as a garment that is moth
eaten . </s>
<s> Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble . </s>
<s> He cometh forth like a flower , and is cut down : he fleeth also as

<s> And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one , and bringest me
into judgment with thee ? </s>
<s>  Who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean ? </s>
<s> not one . </s>
<s> Seeing his days are determined , the number of his months are with
thee , thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass ; Turn
from him , that he may rest , till he shall accomplish , as an hireling ,

<s> For there is hope of a tree , if it be cut down , that it will
sprout again , and that the tender branch thereof will not cease . </s>
<s> Though the root thereof wax old in the earth , and the stock

bud , and bring forth boughs like a plant . </s>
<s> But man dieth , and wasteth away : yea , man giveth up the ghost ,
and where is he ? </s>
<s>  As the waters fail from the sea , and the flood
decayeth and drieth up : So man lieth down , and riseth not : till
the heavens be no more , they shall not awake , nor be raised out of
their sleep . </s>
<s> O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave , that thou wouldest
keep me secret , until thy wrath be past , that thou wouldest appoint me
a set time , and remember me ! </s>
<s>  If a man die , shall he live again ? </s>
<s> the days of my appointed time will I wait , till my change come . </s>
<s> Thou shalt call , and I will answer thee : thou wilt have a desire

<s> For now thou numberest my steps : dost thou not watch over my
sin ? </s>
<s>  My transgression is sealed up in a bag , and thou sewest up
mine iniquity . </s>
<s> And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought , and the rock

<s> The waters wear the stones : thou washest away the things which
grow out of the dust of the earth ; and thou destroyest the hope of
man . </s>
<s> Thou prevailest for ever against him , and he passeth : thou

<s> His sons come to honour , and he knoweth it not ; and they are

Should he reason with unprofitable talk ? </s>
<s> or with speeches wherewith he

<s>  Yea , thou castest off fear , and restrainest
prayer before God . </s>
<s> For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity , and thou choosest the
tongue of the crafty . </s>
<s> Thine own mouth condemneth thee , and not I : yea , thine own lips

<s> How much more abominable and filthy is man , which drinketh
iniquity like water ? </s>
<s>  I will shew thee , hear me ; and that which

fathers , and have not hid it : Unto whom alone the earth was
given , and no stranger passed among them . </s>
<s> The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days , and the number
of years is hidden to the oppressor . </s>
<s> A dreadful sound is in his ears : in prosperity the destroyer
shall come upon him . </s>
<s> He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness , and he is
waited for of the sword . </s>
<s> He wandereth abroad for bread , saying , Where is it ? </s>
<s> he knoweth
that the day of darkness is ready at his hand . </s>
<s> Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid ; they shall prevail
against him , as a king ready to the battle . </s>
<s> For he stretcheth out his hand against God , and strengtheneth
himself against the Almighty . </s>
<s> He runneth upon him , even on his neck , upon the thick bosses of
his bucklers : Because he covereth his face with his fatness , and
maketh collops of fat on his flanks . </s>
<s> And he dwelleth in desolate cities , and in houses which no man
inhabiteth , which are ready to become heaps . </s>
<s> He shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue ,
neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth . </s>
<s> He shall not depart out of darkness ; the flame shall dry up his
branches , and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away . </s>
<s> Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity : for vanity shall
be his recompence . </s>
<s> It shall be accomplished before his time , and his branch shall
not be green . </s>
<s> He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast
off his flower as the olive . </s>
<s> For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate , and fire
shall consume the tabernacles of bribery . </s>
<s> They conceive mischief , and bring forth vanity , and their belly
prepareth deceit . </s>
<s> Then Job answered and said , I have heard many such things :
miserable comforters are ye all . </s>

<s> or what emboldeneth thee that thou
answerest ? </s>
<s>  I also could speak as ye do : if your soul were in my
soul 's stead , I could heap up words against you , and shake mine head
at you . </s>
<s> But I would strengthen you with my mouth , and the moving of my
lips should asswage your grief . </s>
<s> Though I speak , my grief is not asswaged : and though I forbear ,
what am I eased ? </s>
<s>  But now he hath made me weary : thou hast made
desolate all my company . </s>
<s> And thou hast filled me with wrinkles , which is a witness against
me : and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face . </s>
<s> He teareth me in his wrath , who hateth me : he gnasheth upon me
with his teeth ; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me . </s>
<s> They have gaped upon me with their mouth ; they have smitten me
upon the cheek reproachfully ; they have gathered themselves together
against me . </s>
<s> God hath delivered me to the ungodly , and turned me over into
the hands of the wicked . </s>
<s> I was at ease , but he hath broken me asunder : he hath also taken
me by my neck , and shaken me to pieces , and set me up for his mark . </s>
<s> His archers compass me round about , he cleaveth my reins
asunder , and doth not spare ; he poureth out my gall upon the ground . </s>
<s> He breaketh me with breach upon breach , he runneth upon me like
a giant . </s>
<s> I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin , and defiled my horn in the
dust . </s>
<s> My face is foul with weeping , and on my eyelids is the shadow of
death ; Not for any injustice in mine hands : also my prayer is
pure . </s>
<s> O earth , cover not thou my blood , and let my cry have no place . </s>
<s> Also now , behold , my witness is in heaven , and my record is on
high . </s>
<s> My friends scorn me : but mine eye poureth out tears unto God . </s>
<s> O that one might plead for a man with God , as a man pleadeth for
his neighbour ! </s>
<s>  When a few years are come , then I shall go the
way whence I shall not return . </s>
<s> My breath is corrupt , my days are extinct , the graves are ready
for me . </s>
<s> Are there not mockers with me ? </s>
<s> and doth not mine eye continue in
their provocation ? </s>
<s>  Lay down now , put me in a surety with thee ;
who is he that will strike hands with me ? </s>
<s>  For thou hast hid
their heart from understanding : therefore shalt thou not exalt them . </s>
<s> He that speaketh flattery to his friends , even the eyes of his
children shall fail . </s>
<s> He hath made me also a byword of the people ; and aforetime I was
as a tabret . </s>
<s> Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow , and all my members are
as a shadow . </s>
<s> Upright men shall be astonied at this , and the innocent shall
stir up himself against the hypocrite . </s>
<s> The righteous also shall hold on his way , and he that hath clean
hands shall be stronger and stronger . </s>
<s> But as for you all , do ye return , and come now : for I cannot
find one wise man among you . </s>
<s> My days are past , my purposes are broken off , even the thoughts
of my heart . </s>
<s> They change the night into day : the light is short because of
darkness . </s>
<s> If I wait , the grave is mine house : I have made my bed in the
darkness . </s>
<s> I have said to corruption , Thou art my father : to the worm , Thou
art my mother , and my sister . </s>
<s> And where is now my hope ? </s>
<s> as for my hope , who shall see it ? </s>
<s> They shall go down to the bars of the pit , when our rest
together is in the dust . </s>
<s> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite , and said , How long will it
be ere ye make an end of words ? </s>
<s> mark , and afterwards we will speak . </s>
<s> Wherefore are we counted as beasts , and reputed vile in your
sight ? </s>
<s>  He teareth himself in his anger : shall the earth be
forsaken for thee ? </s>
<s> and shall the rock be removed out of his place ? </s>
<s> Yea , the light of the wicked shall be put out , and the spark of
his fire shall not shine . </s>
<s> The light shall be dark in his tabernacle , and his candle shall
be put out with him . </s>
<s> The steps of his strength shall be straitened , and his own
counsel shall cast him down . </s>
<s> For he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he walketh upon a
snare . </s>
<s> The gin shall take him by the heel , and the robber shall prevail
against him . </s>
<s> The snare is laid for him in the ground , and a trap for him in
the way . </s>
<s> Terrors shall make him afraid on every side , and shall drive him
to his feet . </s>
<s> His strength shall be hungerbitten , and destruction shall be
ready at his side . </s>
<s> It shall devour the strength of his skin : even the firstborn of
death shall devour his strength . </s>
<s> His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle , and it
shall bring him to the king of terrors . </s>
<s> It shall dwell in his tabernacle , because it is none of his :
brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation . </s>
<s> His roots shall be dried up beneath , and above shall his branch
be cut off . </s>
<s> His remembrance shall perish from the earth , and he shall have
no name in the street . </s>
<s> He shall be driven from light into darkness , and chased out of
the world . </s>
<s> He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people , nor any
remaining in his dwellings . </s>
<s> They that come after him shall be astonied at his day , as they
that went before were affrighted . </s>
<s> Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked , and this is the
place of him that knoweth not God . </s>
<s> Then Job answered and said , How long will ye vex my soul ,
and break me in pieces with words ? </s>
<s>  These ten times have ye
reproached me : ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to
me . </s>
<s> And be it indeed that I have erred , mine error remaineth with
myself . </s>
<s> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me , and plead
against me my reproach : Know now that God hath overthrown me , and
hath compassed me with his net . </s>
<s> Behold , I cry out of wrong , but I am not heard : I cry aloud , but
there is no judgment . </s>
<s> He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass , and he hath set
darkness in my paths . </s>
<s> He hath stripped me of my glory , and taken the crown from my
head . </s>
<s> He hath destroyed me on every side , and I am gone : and mine hope
hath he removed like a tree . </s>
<s> He hath also kindled his wrath against me , and he counteth me
unto him as one of his enemies . </s>
<s> His troops come together , and raise up their way against me , and
encamp round about my tabernacle . </s>
<s> He hath put my brethren far from me , and mine acquaintance are
verily estranged from me . </s>
<s> My kinsfolk have failed , and my familiar friends have forgotten
me . </s>
<s> They that dwell in mine house , and my maids , count me for a
stranger : I am an alien in their sight . </s>
<s> I called my servant , and he gave me no answer ; I intreated him
with my mouth . </s>
<s> My breath is strange to my wife , though I intreated for the
children 's sake of mine own body . </s>
<s> Yea , young children despised me ; I arose , and they spake against
me . </s>
<s> All my inward friends abhorred me : and they whom I loved are
turned against me . </s>
<s> My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh , and I am escaped
with the skin of my teeth . </s>
<s> Have pity upon me , have pity upon me , O ye my friends ; for the
hand of God hath touched me . </s>
<s> Why do ye persecute me as God , and are not satisfied with my
flesh ? </s>
<s>  Oh that my words were now written ! </s>
<s> oh that they were
printed in a book ! </s>
<s>  That they were graven with an iron pen and
lead in the rock for ever ! </s>
<s>  For I know that my redeemer liveth ,
and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth : And
though after my skin worms destroy this body , yet in my flesh shall I
see God : Whom I shall see for myself , and mine eyes shall
behold , and not another ; though my reins be consumed within me . </s>
<s> But ye should say , Why persecute we him , seeing the root of the
matter is found in me ? </s>
<s>  Be ye afraid of the sword : for wrath
bringeth the punishments of the sword , that ye may know there is a
judgment . </s>
<s> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite , and said , Therefore do
my thoughts cause me to answer , and for this I make haste . </s>
<s> I have heard the check of my reproach , and the spirit of my
understanding causeth me to answer . </s>
<s> Knowest thou not this of old , since man was placed upon earth ,
 That the triumphing of the wicked is short , and the joy of the
hypocrite but for a moment ? </s>
<s>  Though his excellency mount up to
the heavens , and his head reach unto the clouds ; Yet he shall
perish for ever like his own dung : they which have seen him shall say ,
Where is he ? </s>
<s>  He shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be
found : yea , he shall be chased away as a vision of the night . </s>
<s> The eye also which saw him shall see him no more ; neither shall
his place any more behold him . </s>
<s> His children shall seek to please the poor , and his hands shall
restore their goods . </s>
<s> His bones are full of the sin of his youth , which shall lie down
with him in the dust . </s>
<s> Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth , though he hide it under
his tongue ; Though he spare it , and forsake it not ; but keep it
still within his mouth : Yet his meat in his bowels is turned , it
is the gall of asps within him . </s>
<s> He hath swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again :
God shall cast them out of his belly . </s>
<s> He shall suck the poison of asps : the viper 's tongue shall slay
him . </s>
<s> He shall not see the rivers , the floods , the brooks of honey and
butter . </s>
<s> That which he laboured for shall he restore , and shall not
swallow it down : according to his substance shall the restitution be ,
and he shall not rejoice therein . </s>
<s> Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor ; because he
hath violently taken away an house which he builded not ; Surely
he shall not feel quietness in his belly , he shall not save of that
which he desired . </s>
<s> There shall none of his meat be left ; therefore shall no man
look for his goods . </s>
<s> In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits : every
hand of the wicked shall come upon him . </s>
<s> When he is about to fill his belly , God shall cast the fury of
his wrath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is eating . </s>
<s> He shall flee from the iron weapon , and the bow of steel shall
strike him through . </s>
<s> It is drawn , and cometh out of the body ; yea , the glittering
sword cometh out of his gall : terrors are upon him . </s>
<s> All darkness shall be hid in his secret places : a fire not blown
shall consume him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his
tabernacle . </s>
<s> The heaven shall reveal his iniquity ; and the earth shall rise
up against him . </s>
<s> The increase of his house shall depart , and his goods shall flow
away in the day of his wrath . </s>
<s> This is the portion of a wicked man from God , and the heritage
appointed unto him by God . </s>
<s> But Job answered and said , Hear diligently my speech , and
let this be your consolations . </s>
<s> Suffer me that I may speak ; and after that I have spoken , mock
on . </s>
<s> As for me , is my complaint to man ? </s>
<s> and if it were so , why should
not my spirit be troubled ? </s>
<s>  Mark me , and be astonished , and lay
your hand upon your mouth . </s>
<s> Even when I remember I am afraid , and trembling taketh hold on my
flesh . </s>
<s> Wherefore do the wicked live , become old , yea , are mighty in
power ? </s>
<s>  Their seed is established in their sight with them , and
their offspring before their eyes . </s>
<s> Their houses are safe from fear , neither is the rod of God upon
them . </s>
<s> Their bull gendereth , and faileth not ; their cow calveth , and
casteth not her calf . </s>
<s> They send forth their little ones like a flock , and their
children dance . </s>
<s> They take the timbrel and harp , and rejoice at the sound of the
organ . </s>
<s> They spend their days in wealth , and in a moment go down to the
grave . </s>
<s> Therefore they say unto God , Depart from us ; for we desire not
the knowledge of thy ways . </s>
<s> What is the Almighty , that we should serve him ? </s>
<s> and what profit
should we have , if we pray unto him ? </s>
<s>  Lo , their good is not in
their hand : the counsel of the wicked is far from me . </s>
<s> How oft is the candle of the wicked put out ! </s>
<s> and how oft cometh
their destruction upon them ! </s>
<s> God distributeth sorrows in his anger . </s>
<s> They are as stubble before the wind , and as chaff that the storm
carrieth away . </s>
<s> God layeth up his iniquity for his children : he rewardeth him ,
and he shall know it . </s>
<s> His eyes shall see his destruction , and he shall drink of the
wrath of the Almighty . </s>
<s> For what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the
number of his months is cut off in the midst ? </s>
<s>  Shall any teach
God knowledge ? </s>
<s> seeing he judgeth those that are high . </s>
<s> One dieth in his full strength , being wholly at ease and quiet . </s>
<s> His breasts are full of milk , and his bones are moistened with
marrow . </s>
<s> And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul , and never
eateth with pleasure . </s>
<s> They shall lie down alike in the dust , and the worms shall cover
them . </s>
<s> Behold , I know your thoughts , and the devices which ye
wrongfully imagine against me . </s>
<s> For ye say , Where is the house of the prince ? </s>
<s> and where are the
dwelling places of the wicked ? </s>
<s>  Have ye not asked them that go
by the way ? </s>
<s> and do ye not know their tokens , That the wicked is
reserved to the day of destruction ? </s>
<s> they shall be brought forth to the
day of wrath . </s>
<s> Who shall declare his way to his face ? </s>
<s> and who shall repay him
what he hath done ? </s>
<s>  Yet shall he be brought to the grave , and
shall remain in the tomb . </s>
<s> The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him , and every man
shall draw after him , as there are innumerable before him . </s>
<s> How then comfort ye me in vain , seeing in your answers there
remaineth falsehood ? </s>
<s>  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and
said , Can a man be profitable unto God , as he that is wise may be
profitable unto himself ? </s>
<s>  Is it any pleasure to the Almighty ,
that thou art righteous ? </s>
<s> or is it gain to him , that thou makest thy
ways perfect ? </s>
<s>  Will he reprove thee for fear of thee ? </s>
<s> will he
enter with thee into judgment ? </s>
<s>  Is not thy wickedness great ? </s>
<s> and
thine iniquities infinite ? </s>
<s>  For thou hast taken a pledge from thy
brother for nought , and stripped the naked of their clothing . </s>
<s> Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink , and thou hast
withholden bread from the hungry . </s>
<s> But as for the mighty man , he had the earth ; and the honourable
man dwelt in it . </s>
<s> Thou hast sent widows away empty , and the arms of the fatherless
have been broken . </s>
<s> Therefore snares are round about thee , and sudden fear troubleth
thee ; Or darkness , that thou canst not see ; and abundance of
waters cover thee . </s>
<s> Is not God in the height of heaven ? </s>
<s> and behold the height of the
stars , how high they are ! </s>
<s>  And thou sayest , How doth God know ? </s>
<s> he judge through the dark cloud ? </s>
<s>  Thick clouds are a
covering to him , that he seeth not ; and he walketh in the circuit of
heaven . </s>
<s> Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden ? </s>
<s> Which were cut down out of time , whose foundation was overflown
with a flood : Which said unto God , Depart from us : and what can
the Almighty do for them ? </s>
<s>  Yet he filled their houses with good
things : but the counsel of the wicked is far from me . </s>
<s> The righteous see it , and are glad : and the innocent laugh them
to scorn . </s>
<s> Whereas our substance is not cut down , but the remnant of them
the fire consumeth . </s>
<s> Acquaint now thyself with him , and be at peace : thereby good
shall come unto thee . </s>
<s> Receive , I pray thee , the law from his mouth , and lay up his
words in thine heart . </s>
<s> If thou return to the Almighty , thou shalt be built up , thou
shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles . </s>
<s> Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust , and the gold of Ophir as
the stones of the brooks . </s>
<s> Yea , the Almighty shall be thy defence , and thou shalt have
plenty of silver . </s>
<s> For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty , and shalt
lift up thy face unto God . </s>
<s> Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he shall hear thee , and
thou shalt pay thy vows . </s>
<s> Thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto
thee : and the light shall shine upon thy ways . </s>
<s> When men are cast down , then thou shalt say , There is lifting
up ; and he shall save the humble person . </s>
<s> He shall deliver the island of the innocent : and it is delivered
by the pureness of thine hands . </s>
<s> Then Job answered and said , Even to day is my complaint
bitter : my stroke is heavier than my groaning . </s>
<s> Oh that I knew where I might find him ! </s>
<s> that I might come even to
his seat ! </s>
<s>  I would order my cause before him , and fill my mouth
with arguments . </s>
<s> I would know the words which he would answer me , and understand
what he would say unto me . </s>
<s> Will he plead against me with his great power ? </s>
<s> No ; but he would
put strength in me . </s>
<s> There the righteous might dispute with him ; so should I be
delivered for ever from my judge . </s>
<s> Behold , I go forward , but he is not there ; and backward , but I
cannot perceive him : On the left hand , where he doth work , but I
cannot behold him : he hideth himself on the right hand , that I cannot
see him : But he knoweth the way that I take : when he hath tried
me , I shall come forth as gold . </s>
<s> My foot hath held his steps , his way have I kept , and not
declined . </s>
<s> Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips ; I
have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food . </s>
<s> But he is in one mind , and who can turn him ? </s>
<s> and what his soul
desireth , even that he doeth . </s>
<s> For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me : and many
such things are with him . </s>
<s> Therefore am I troubled at his presence : when I consider , I am
afraid of him . </s>
<s> For God maketh my heart soft , and the Almighty troubleth me :
 Because I was not cut off before the darkness , neither hath he
covered the darkness from my face . </s>
<s> Why , seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty , do they that
know him not see his days ? </s>
<s>  Some remove the landmarks ; they
violently take away flocks , and feed thereof . </s>
<s> They drive away the ass of the fatherless , they take the widow 's
ox for a pledge . </s>
<s> They turn the needy out of the way : the poor of the earth hide
themselves together . </s>
<s> Behold , as wild asses in the desert , go they forth to their work ;
rising betimes for a prey : the wilderness yieldeth food for them and
for their children . </s>
<s> They reap every one his corn in the field : and they gather the
vintage of the wicked . </s>
<s> They cause the naked to lodge without clothing , that they have no
covering in the cold . </s>
<s> They are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the
rock for want of a shelter . </s>
<s> They pluck the fatherless from the breast , and take a pledge of
the poor . </s>
<s> They cause him to go naked without clothing , and they take away
the sheaf from the hungry ; Which make oil within their walls ,
and tread their winepresses , and suffer thirst . </s>
<s> Men groan from out of the city , and the soul of the wounded
crieth out : yet God layeth not folly to them . </s>
<s> They are of those that rebel against the light ; they know not
the ways thereof , nor abide in the paths thereof . </s>
<s> The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy ,
and in the night is as a thief . </s>
<s> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight , saying ,
No eye shall see me : and disguiseth his face . </s>
<s> In the dark they dig through houses , which they had marked for
themselves in the daytime : they know not the light . </s>
<s> For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death : if one
know them , they are in the terrors of the shadow of death . </s>
<s> He is swift as the waters ; their portion is cursed in the earth :
he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards . </s>
<s> Drought and heat consume the snow waters : so doth the grave
those which have sinned . </s>
<s> The womb shall forget him ; the worm shall feed sweetly on him ;
he shall be no more remembered ; and wickedness shall be broken as a
tree . </s>
<s> He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not : and doeth not
good to the widow . </s>
<s> He draweth also the mighty with his power : he riseth up , and no
man is sure of life . </s>
<s> Though it be given him to be in safety , whereon he resteth ; yet
his eyes are upon their ways . </s>
<s> They are exalted for a little while , but are gone and brought
low ; they are taken out of the way as all other , and cut off as the
tops of the ears of corn . </s>
<s> And if it be not so now , who will make me a liar , and make my
speech nothing worth ? </s>
<s>  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite , and
said , Dominion and fear are with him , he maketh peace in his high
places . </s>
<s> Is there any number of his armies ? </s>
<s> and upon whom doth not his
light arise ? </s>
<s>  How then can man be justified with God ? </s>
<s> or how can
he be clean that is born of a woman ? </s>
<s>  Behold even to the moon ,

worm ? </s>

uttered words ? </s>

<s>  Dead things are
formed from under the waters , and the inhabitants thereof . </s>
<s> Hell is naked before him , and destruction hath no covering . </s>
<s> He stretcheth out the north over the empty place , and hangeth the
earth upon nothing . </s>
<s> He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds ; and the cloud is
not rent under them . </s>
<s> He holdeth back the face of his throne , and spreadeth his cloud
upon it . </s>
<s> He hath compassed the waters with bounds , until the day and
night come to an end . </s>
<s> The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof . </s>
<s> He divideth the sea with his power , and by his understanding he
smiteth through the proud . </s>
<s> By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens ; his hand hath
formed the crooked serpent . </s>
<s> Lo , these are parts of his ways : but how little a portion is
heard of him ? </s>

when my children were about me ; When I washed my steps with
butter , and the rock poured me out rivers of oil ; When I went out
to the gate through the city , when I prepared my seat in the street ! </s>
<s> The young men saw me , and hid themselves : and the aged arose , and
stood up . </s>
<s> The princes refrained talking , and laid their hand on their
mouth . </s>
<s> The nobles held their peace , and their tongue cleaved to the
roof of their mouth . </s>
<s> When the ear heard me , then it blessed me ; and when the eye saw
me , it gave witness to me : Because I delivered the poor that
cried , and the fatherless , and him that had none to help him . </s>
<s> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me : and I
caused the widow 's heart to sing for joy . </s>
<s> I put on righteousness , and it clothed me : my judgment was as a
robe and a diadem . </s>
<s> I was eyes to the blind , and feet was I to the lame . </s>
<s> I was a father to the poor : and the cause which I knew not I
searched out . </s>
<s> And I brake the jaws of the wicked , and plucked the spoil out of
his teeth . </s>
<s> Then I said , I shall die in my nest , and I shall multiply my
days as the sand . </s>
<s> My root was spread out by the waters , and the dew lay all night
upon my branch . </s>
<s> My glory was fresh in me , and my bow was renewed in my hand . </s>
<s> Unto me men gave ear , and waited , and kept silence at my
counsel . </s>
<s> After my words they spake not again ; and my speech dropped upon
them . </s>
<s> And they waited for me as for the rain ; and they opened their
mouth wide as for the latter rain . </s>
<s> If I laughed on them , they believed it not ; and the light of my
countenance they cast not down . </s>
<s> I chose out their way , and sat chief , and dwelt as a king in the
army , as one that comforteth the mourners . </s>
<s> But now they that are younger than I have me in derision , whose
fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock . </s>
<s> Yea , whereto might the strength of their hands profit me , in whom
old age was perished ? </s>
<s>  For want and famine they were solitary ;
fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste . </s>
<s> Who cut up mallows by the bushes , and juniper roots for their
meat . </s>
<s> They were driven forth from among men , (they cried after them as
after a thief ;) To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys , in caves
of the earth , and in the rocks . </s>
<s> Among the bushes they brayed ; under the nettles they were
gathered together . </s>
<s> They were children of fools , yea , children of base men : they were
viler than the earth . </s>
<s> And now am I their song , yea , I am their byword . </s>
<s> They abhor me , they flee far from me , and spare not to spit in
my face . </s>
<s> Because he hath loosed my cord , and afflicted me , they have also
let loose the bridle before me . </s>
<s> Upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my feet , and
they raise up against me the ways of their destruction . </s>
<s> They mar my path , they set forward my calamity , they have no
helper . </s>
<s> They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters : in the
desolation they rolled themselves upon me . </s>
<s> Terrors are turned upon me : they pursue my soul as the wind : and
my welfare passeth away as a cloud . </s>
<s> And now my soul is poured out upon me ; the days of affliction
have taken hold upon me . </s>
<s> My bones are pierced in me in the night season : and my sinews
take no rest . </s>
<s> By the great force of my disease is my garment changed : it
bindeth me about as the collar of my coat . </s>
<s> He hath cast me into the mire , and I am become like dust and
ashes . </s>
<s> I cry unto thee , and thou dost not hear me : I stand up , and thou
regardest me not . </s>
<s> Thou art become cruel to me : with thy strong hand thou opposest
thyself against me . </s>
<s> Thou liftest me up to the wind ; thou causest me to ride upon it ,
and dissolvest my substance . </s>
<s> For I know that thou wilt bring me to death , and to the house
appointed for all living . </s>
<s> Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave , though
they cry in his destruction . </s>
<s> Did not I weep for him that was in trouble ? </s>
<s> was not my soul
grieved for the poor ? </s>
<s>  When I looked for good , then evil came
unto me : and when I waited for light , there came darkness . </s>
<s> My bowels boiled , and rested not : the days of affliction
prevented me . </s>
<s> I went mourning without the sun : I stood up , and I cried in the
congregation . </s>
<s> I am a brother to dragons , and a companion to owls . </s>
<s> My skin is black upon me , and my bones are burned with heat . </s>
<s> My harp also is turned to mourning , and my organ into the voice
of them that weep . </s>
<s> I made a covenant with mine eyes ; why then should I think upon a
maid ? </s>
<s>  For what portion of God is there from above ? </s>
<s> and what
inheritance of the Almighty from on high ? </s>
<s>  Is not destruction to
the wicked ? </s>
<s> and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity ? </s>
<s> 
Doth not he see my ways , and count all my steps ? </s>
<s>  If I have
walked with vanity , or if my foot hath hasted to deceit ; Let me
be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity . </s>
<s> If my step hath turned out of the way , and mine heart walked
after mine eyes , and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands ; Then
let me sow , and let another eat ; yea , let my offspring be rooted out . </s>
<s> If mine heart have been deceived by a woman , or if I have laid
wait at my neighbour 's door ; Then let my wife grind unto
another , and let others bow down upon her . </s>
<s> For this is an heinous crime ; yea , it is an iniquity to be
punished by the judges . </s>
<s> For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction , and would root
out all mine increase . </s>
<s> If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my
maidservant , when they contended with me ; What then shall I do
when God riseth up ? </s>
<s> and when he visiteth , what shall I answer him ? </s>
<s> Did not he that made me in the womb make him ? </s>
<s> and did not one
fashion us in the womb ? </s>
<s>  If I have withheld the poor from their
desire , or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail ; Or have
eaten my morsel myself alone , and the fatherless hath not eaten
thereof ; (For from my youth he was brought up with me , as with a
father , and I have guided her from my mother 's womb ;) If I have
seen any perish for want of clothing , or any poor without covering ;
 If his loins have not blessed me , and if he were not warmed with
the fleece of my sheep ; If I have lifted up my hand against the
fatherless , when I saw my help in the gate : Then let mine arm
fall from my shoulder blade , and mine arm be broken from the bone . </s>
<s> For destruction from God was a terror to me , and by reason of
his highness I could not endure . </s>
<s> If I have made gold my hope , or have said to the fine gold , Thou
art my confidence ; If I rejoice because my wealth was great , and
because mine hand had gotten much ; If I beheld the sun when it
shined , or the moon walking in brightness ; And my heart hath
been secretly enticed , or my mouth hath kissed my hand : This
also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge : for I should have
denied the God that is above . </s>
<s> If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me , or lifted
up myself when evil found him : Neither have I suffered my mouth
to sin by wishing a curse to his soul . </s>
<s> If the men of my tabernacle said not , Oh that we had of his
flesh ! </s>
<s> we cannot be satisfied . </s>
<s> The stranger did not lodge in the street : but I opened my doors
to the traveller . </s>
<s> If I covered my transgressions as Adam , by hiding mine iniquity
in my bosom : Did I fear a great multitude , or did the contempt
of families terrify me , that I kept silence , and went not out of the
door ? </s>
<s>  Oh that one would hear me ! </s>
<s> behold , my desire is , that the
Almighty would answer me , and that mine adversary had written a book . </s>
<s> Surely I would take it upon my shoulder , and bind it as a crown
to me . </s>
<s> I would declare unto him the number of my steps ; as a prince
would I go near unto him . </s>
<s> If my land cry against me , or that the furrows likewise thereof
complain ; If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money , or
have caused the owners thereof to lose their life : Let thistles
grow instead of wheat , and cockle instead of barley . </s>
<s> words of Job are ended . </s>
<s> So these three men ceased to answer Job , because he was righteous
in his own eyes . </s>
<s> Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the
Buzite , of the kindred of Ram : against Job was his wrath kindled ,
because he justified himself rather than God . </s>
<s> Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled , because
they had found no answer , and yet had condemned Job . </s>
<s> Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken , because they were elder
than he . </s>
<s> When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
three men , then his wrath was kindled . </s>
<s> And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said , I am
young , and ye are very old ; wherefore I was afraid , and durst not shew
you mine opinion . </s>
<s> I said , Days should speak , and multitude of years should teach
wisdom . </s>
<s> But there is a spirit in man : and the inspiration of the Almighty
giveth them understanding . </s>
<s> Great men are not always wise : neither do the aged understand
judgment . </s>
<s> Therefore I said , Hearken to me ; I also will shew mine opinion . </s>
<s> Behold , I waited for your words ; I gave ear to your reasons ,
whilst ye searched out what to say . </s>
<s> Yea , I attended unto you , and , behold , there was none of you
that convinced Job , or that answered his words : Lest ye should
say , We have found out wisdom : God thrusteth him down , not man . </s>
<s> Now he hath not directed his words against me : neither will I
answer him with your speeches . </s>
<s> They were amazed , they answered no more : they left off speaking . </s>
<s> When I had waited , (for they spake not , but stood still , and
answered no more ;) I said , I will answer also my part , I also
will shew mine opinion . </s>
<s> For I am full of matter , the spirit within me constraineth me . </s>
<s> Behold , my belly is as wine which hath no vent ; it is ready to
burst like new bottles . </s>
<s> I will speak , that I may be refreshed : I will open my lips and
answer . </s>
<s> Let me not , I pray you , accept any man 's person , neither let me
give flattering titles unto man . </s>
<s> For I know not to give flattering titles ; in so doing my maker
would soon take me away . </s>
<s> Wherefore , Job , I pray thee , hear my speeches , and hearken to all
my words . </s>
<s> Behold , now I have opened my mouth , my tongue hath spoken in my
mouth . </s>
<s> My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart : and my lips
shall utter knowledge clearly . </s>
<s> The spirit of God hath made me , and the breath of the Almighty
hath given me life . </s>
<s> If thou canst answer me , set thy words in order before me , stand
up . </s>
<s> Behold , I am according to thy wish in God 's stead : I also am
formed out of the clay . </s>
<s> Behold , my terror shall not make thee afraid , neither shall my
hand be heavy upon thee . </s>
<s> Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing , and I have heard the
voice of thy words , saying , I am clean without transgression , I
am innocent ; neither is there iniquity in me . </s>
<s> Behold , he findeth occasions against me , he counteth me for his
enemy , He putteth my feet in the stocks , he marketh all my
paths . </s>
<s> Behold , in this thou art not just : I will answer thee , that God
is greater than man . </s>
<s> Why dost thou strive against him ? </s>
<s> for he giveth not account of
any of his matters . </s>
<s> For God speaketh once , yea twice , yet man perceiveth it not . </s>
<s> In a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falleth
upon men , in slumberings upon the bed ; Then he openeth the ears
of men , and sealeth their instruction , That he may withdraw man
from his purpose , and hide pride from man . </s>
<s> He keepeth back his soul from the pit , and his life from
perishing by the sword . </s>
<s> He is chastened also with pain upon his bed , and the multitude
of his bones with strong pain : So that his life abhorreth bread ,
and his soul dainty meat . </s>
<s> His flesh is consumed away , that it cannot be seen ; and his
bones that were not seen stick out . </s>
<s> Yea , his soul draweth near unto the grave , and his life to the
destroyers . </s>
<s> If there be a messenger with him , an interpreter , one among a
thousand , to shew unto man his uprightness : Then he is gracious
unto him , and saith , Deliver him from going down to the pit : I have
found a ransom . </s>
<s> His flesh shall be fresher than a child 's : he shall return to
the days of his youth : He shall pray unto God , and he will be
favourable unto him : and he shall see his face with joy : for he will
render unto man his righteousness . </s>
<s> He looketh upon men , and if any say , I have sinned , and
perverted that which was right , and it profited me not ; He will
deliver his soul from going into the pit , and his life shall see the
light . </s>
<s> Lo , all these things worketh God oftentimes with man , To
bring back his soul from the pit , to be enlightened with the light of
the living . </s>
<s> Mark well , O Job , hearken unto me : hold thy peace , and I will
speak . </s>
<s> If thou hast anything to say , answer me : speak , for I desire to
justify thee . </s>
<s> If not , hearken unto me : hold thy peace , and I shall teach thee
wisdom . </s>
<s> Furthermore Elihu answered and said , Hear my words , O ye
wise men ; and give ear unto me , ye that have knowledge . </s>
<s> For the ear trieth words , as the mouth tasteth meat . </s>
<s> Let us choose to us judgment : let us know among ourselves what is
good . </s>
<s> For Job hath said , I am righteous : and God hath taken away my
judgment . </s>
<s> Should I lie against my right ? </s>
<s> my wound is incurable without
transgression . </s>
<s> What man is like Job , who drinketh up scorning like water ? </s>
<s> 
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity , and walketh with
wicked men . </s>
<s> For he hath said , It profiteth a man nothing that he should
delight himself with God . </s>
<s> Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding : far be it
from God , that he should do wickedness ; and from the Almighty , that he
should commit iniquity . </s>
<s> For the work of a man shall he render unto him , and cause every
man to find according to his ways . </s>
<s> Yea , surely God will not do wickedly , neither will the Almighty
pervert judgment . </s>
<s> Who hath given him a charge over the earth ? </s>
<s> or who hath disposed
the whole world ? </s>
<s>  If he set his heart upon man , if he gather
unto himself his spirit and his breath ; All flesh shall perish
together , and man shall turn again unto dust . </s>
<s> If now thou hast understanding , hear this : hearken to the voice
of my words . </s>
<s> Shall even he that hateth right govern ? </s>
<s> and wilt thou condemn
him that is most just ? </s>
<s>  Is it fit to say to a king , Thou art
wicked ? </s>
<s> and to princes , Ye are ungodly ? </s>
<s>  How much less to him
that accepteth not the persons of princes , nor regardeth the rich more
than the poor ? </s>
<s> for they all are the work of his hands . </s>
<s> In a moment shall they die , and the people shall be troubled at
midnight , and pass away : and the mighty shall be taken away without
hand . </s>
<s> For his eyes are upon the ways of man , and he seeth all his
goings . </s>
<s> There is no darkness , nor shadow of death , where the workers of
iniquity may hide themselves . </s>
<s> For he will not lay upon man more than right ; that he should
enter into judgment with God . </s>
<s> He shall break in pieces mighty men without number , and set
others in their stead . </s>
<s> Therefore he knoweth their works , and he overturneth them in the
night , so that they are destroyed . </s>
<s> He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others ;
 Because they turned back from him , and would not consider any of
his ways : So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto
him , and he heareth the cry of the afflicted . </s>
<s> When he giveth quietness , who then can make trouble ? </s>
<s> and when he
hideth his face , who then can behold him ? </s>
<s> whether it be done against a
nation , or against a man only : That the hypocrite reign not ,
lest the people be ensnared . </s>
<s> Surely it is meet to be said unto God , I have borne
chastisement , I will not offend any more : That which I see not
teach thou me : if I have done iniquity , I will do no more . </s>
<s> Should it be according to thy mind ? </s>
<s> he will recompense it ,
whether thou refuse , or whether thou choose ; and not I : therefore
speak what thou knowest . </s>
<s> Let men of understanding tell me , and let a wise man hearken
unto me . </s>
<s> Job hath spoken without knowledge , and his words were without
wisdom . </s>
<s> My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his
answers for wicked men . </s>
<s> For he addeth rebellion unto his sin , he clappeth his hands
among us , and multiplieth his words against God . </s>
<s> Elihu spake moreover , and said , Thinkest thou this to be
right , that thou saidst , My righteousness is more than God 's ? </s>
<s> 
For thou saidst , What advantage will it be unto thee ? </s>
<s> and , What profit
shall I have , if I be cleansed from my sin ? </s>
<s>  I will answer thee ,
and thy companions with thee . </s>
<s> Look unto the heavens , and see ; and behold the clouds which are
higher than thou . </s>
<s> If thou sinnest , what doest thou against him ? </s>
<s> or if thy
transgressions be multiplied , what doest thou unto him ? </s>
<s>  If thou
be righteous , what givest thou him ? </s>
<s> or what receiveth he of thine
hand ? </s>
<s>  Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art ; and thy
righteousness may profit the son of man . </s>
<s> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed
to cry : they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty . </s>
<s> But none saith , Where is God my maker , who giveth songs in the
night ; Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth , and
maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven ? </s>
<s>  There they cry , but
none giveth answer , because of the pride of evil men . </s>
<s> Surely God will not hear vanity , neither will the Almighty
regard it . </s>
<s> Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him , yet judgment is
before him ; therefore trust thou in him . </s>
<s> But now , because it is not so , he hath visited in his anger ; yet
he knoweth it not in great extremity : Therefore doth Job open
his mouth in vain ; he multiplieth words without knowledge . </s>
<s> Elihu also proceeded , and said , Suffer me a little , and I
will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God 's behalf . </s>
<s> I will fetch my knowledge from afar , and will ascribe
righteousness to my Maker . </s>
<s> For truly my words shall not be false : he that is perfect in
knowledge is with thee . </s>
<s> Behold , God is mighty , and despiseth not any : he is mighty in
strength and wisdom . </s>
<s> He preserveth not the life of the wicked : but giveth right to the
poor . </s>
<s> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous : but with kings
are they on the throne ; yea , he doth establish them for ever , and they
are exalted . </s>
<s> And if they be bound in fetters , and be holden in cords of
affliction ; Then he sheweth them their work , and their
transgressions that they have exceeded . </s>
<s> He openeth also their ear to discipline , and commandeth that
they return from iniquity . </s>
<s> If they obey and serve him , they shall spend their days in
prosperity , and their years in pleasures . </s>
<s> But if they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they
shall die without knowledge . </s>
<s> But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath : they cry not when he
bindeth them . </s>
<s> They die in youth , and their life is among the unclean . </s>
<s> He delivereth the poor in his affliction , and openeth their ears
in oppression . </s>
<s> Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a
broad place , where there is no straitness ; and that which should be
set on thy table should be full of fatness . </s>
<s> But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked : judgment and
justice take hold on thee . </s>
<s> Because there is wrath , beware lest he take thee away with his
stroke : then a great ransom cannot deliver thee . </s>
<s> Will he esteem thy riches ? </s>
<s> no , not gold , nor all the forces of
strength . </s>
<s> Desire not the night , when people are cut off in their place . </s>
<s> Take heed , regard not iniquity : for this hast thou chosen rather
than affliction . </s>
<s> Behold , God exalteth by his power : who teacheth like him ? </s>
<s> 
Who hath enjoined him his way ? </s>
<s> or who can say , Thou hast wrought
iniquity ? </s>
<s>  Remember that thou magnify his work , which men
behold . </s>
<s> Every man may see it ; man may behold it afar off . </s>
<s> Behold , God is great , and we know him not , neither can the
number of his years be searched out . </s>
<s> For he maketh small the drops of water : they pour down rain
according to the vapour thereof : Which the clouds do drop and
distil upon man abundantly . </s>
<s> Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds , or the
noise of his tabernacle ? </s>
<s>  Behold , he spreadeth his light upon
it , and covereth the bottom of the sea . </s>
<s> For by them judgeth he the people ; he giveth meat in abundance . </s>
<s> With clouds he covereth the light ; and commandeth it not to
shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt . </s>
<s> The noise thereof sheweth concerning it , the cattle also
concerning the vapour . </s>
<s> At this also my heart trembleth , and is moved out of his place . </s>
<s> Hear attentively the noise of his voice , and the sound that goeth
out of his mouth . </s>
<s> He directeth it under the whole heaven , and his lightning unto
the ends of the earth . </s>
<s> After it a voice roareth : he thundereth with the voice of his
excellency ; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard . </s>
<s> God thundereth marvellously with his voice ; great things doeth
he , which we cannot comprehend . </s>
<s> For he saith to the snow , Be thou on the earth ; likewise to the
small rain , and to the great rain of his strength . </s>
<s> He sealeth up the hand of every man ; that all men may know his
work . </s>
<s> Then the beasts go into dens , and remain in their places . </s>
<s> Out of the south cometh the whirlwind : and cold out of the north . </s>
<s> By the breath of God frost is given : and the breadth of the
waters is straitened . </s>
<s> Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud : he scattereth his
bright cloud : And it is turned round about by his counsels : that
they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world
in the earth . </s>
<s> He causeth it to come , whether for correction , or for his land ,
or for mercy . </s>
<s> Hearken unto this , O Job : stand still , and consider the wondrous
works of God . </s>
<s> Dost thou know when God disposed them , and caused the light of
his cloud to shine ? </s>
<s>  Dost thou know the balancings of the
clouds , the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge ? </s>
<s> How thy garments are warm , when he quieteth the earth by the
south wind ? </s>
<s>  Hast thou with him spread out the sky , which is
strong , and as a molten looking glass ? </s>
<s>  Teach us what we shall
say unto him ; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness . </s>
<s> Shall it be told him that I speak ? </s>
<s> if a man speak , surely he
shall be swallowed up . </s>
<s> And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds : but
the wind passeth , and cleanseth them . </s>
<s> Fair weather cometh out of the north : with God is terrible
majesty . </s>
<s> Touching the Almighty , we cannot find him out : he is excellent
in power , and in judgment , and in plenty of justice : he will not
afflict . </s>
<s> Men do therefore fear him : he respecteth not any that are wise
of heart . </s>
<s> Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind , and said , 
Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge ? </s>
<s> 
Gird up now thy loins like a man ; for I will demand of thee , and
answer thou me . </s>
<s> Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth ? </s>
<s> if thou hast understanding . </s>
<s> Who hath laid the measures thereof , if thou knowest ? </s>
<s> or who hath
stretched the line upon it ? </s>
<s>  Whereupon are the foundations
thereof fastened ? </s>
<s> or who laid the corner stone thereof ; When the
morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ? </s>
<s> Or who shut up the sea with doors , when it brake forth , as if it
had issued out of the womb ? </s>
<s>  When I made the cloud the garment
thereof , and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it , And brake up
for it my decreed place , and set bars and doors , And said ,
Hitherto shalt thou come , but no further : and here shall thy proud
waves be stayed ? </s>
<s>  Hast thou commanded the morning since thy
days ; and caused the dayspring to know his place ; That it might
take hold of the ends of the earth , that the wicked might be shaken
out of it ? </s>
<s>  It is turned as clay to the seal ; and they stand as
a garment . </s>
<s> And from the wicked their light is withholden , and the high arm
shall be broken . </s>
<s> Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea ? </s>
<s> or hast thou
walked in the search of the depth ? </s>
<s>  Have the gates of death been
opened unto thee ? </s>
<s> or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death ? </s>
<s> Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth ? </s>

<s> Where is the way where light dwelleth ? </s>
<s> and as for darkness ,

bound thereof , and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house
thereof ? </s>
<s>  Knowest thou it , because thou wast then born ? </s>
<s> or
because the number of thy days is great ? </s>
<s>  Hast thou entered into
the treasures of the snow ? </s>

hail , Which I have reserved against the time of trouble , against
the day of battle and war ? </s>
<s>  By what way is the light parted ,
which scattereth the east wind upon the earth ? </s>
<s>  Who hath divided
a watercourse for the overflowing of waters , or a way for the
lightning of thunder ; To cause it to rain on the earth , where no
man is ; on the wilderness , wherein there is no man ; To satisfy
the desolate and waste ground ; and to cause the bud of the tender herb
to spring forth ? </s>
<s>  Hath the rain a father ? </s>

the drops of dew ? </s>
<s>  Out of whose womb came the ice ? </s>
<s> and the hoary
frost of heaven , who hath gendered it ? </s>
<s>  The waters are hid as

earth ? </s>
<s>  Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds , that

Wilt thou believe him , that he will bring home thy seed , and gather it

<s>  Which leaveth her eggs
in the earth , and warmeth them in dust , And forgetteth that the
foot may crush them , or that the wild beast may break them . </s>
<s> She is hardened against her young ones , as though they were not
her 's : her labour is in vain without fear ; Because God hath
deprived her of wisdom , neither hath he imparted to her understanding . </s>
<s> What time she lifteth up herself on high , she scorneth the horse
and his rider . </s>
<s> Hast thou given the horse strength ? </s>
<s> hast thou clothed his neck
with thunder ? </s>
<s>  Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper ? </s>
<s> the
glory of his nostrils is terrible . </s>
<s> He paweth in the valley , and rejoiceth in his strength : he goeth
on to meet the armed men . </s>
<s> He mocketh at fear , and is not affrighted ; neither turneth he
back from the sword . </s>
<s> The quiver rattleth against him , the glittering spear and the
shield . </s>
<s> He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage : neither
believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet . </s>
<s> He saith among the trumpets , Ha , ha ; and he smelleth the battle
afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting . </s>
<s> Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom , and stretch her wings toward
the south ? </s>
<s>  Doth the eagle mount up at thy command , and make her
nest on high ? </s>
<s>  She dwelleth and abideth on the rock , upon the
crag of the rock , and the strong place . </s>
<s> From thence she seeketh the prey , and her eyes behold afar off . </s>
<s> Her young ones also suck up blood : and where the slain are ,

<s> Moreover the LORD answered Job , and said , Shall he that

<s> Then Job answered the LORD , and said , Behold , I am vile ;
what shall I answer thee ? </s>
<s> I will lay mine hand upon my mouth . </s>
<s> Once have I spoken ; but I will not answer : yea , twice ; but I will
proceed no further . </s>
<s> Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind , and said ,
 Gird up thy loins now like a man : I will demand of thee , and
declare thou unto me . </s>
<s> Wilt thou also disannul my judgment ? </s>
<s> wilt thou condemn me , that

<s>  Hast thou an arm like God ? </s>

<s> Look on every one that is proud , and bring him low ; and tread

<s> Hide them in the dust together ; and bind their faces in secret . </s>
<s> Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can

<s> Behold now behemoth , which I made with thee ; he eateth grass as

<s> Lo now , his strength is in his loins , and his force is in the
navel of his belly . </s>
<s> He moveth his tail like a cedar : the sinews of his stones are
wrapped together . </s>
<s> His bones are as strong pieces of brass ; his bones are like bars
of iron . </s>
<s> He is the chief of the ways of God : he that made him can make
his sword to approach unto him . </s>
<s> Surely the mountains bring him forth food , where all the beasts
of the field play . </s>
<s> He lieth under the shady trees , in the covert of the reed , and
fens . </s>
<s> The shady trees cover him with their shadow ; the willows of the
brook compass him about . </s>
<s> Behold , he drinketh up a river , and hasteth not : he trusteth

<s> He taketh it with his eyes : his nose pierceth through snares . </s>
<s> Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook ? </s>
<s> or his tongue with a

<s> or bore his jaw through with a thorn ? </s>

<s>  None is so fierce that dare stir him
up : who then is able to stand before me ? </s>
<s>  Who hath prevented me ,
that I should repay him ? </s>
<s> whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine . </s>
<s> I will not conceal his parts , nor his power , nor his comely
proportion . </s>
<s> Who can discover the face of his garment ? </s>
<s> or who can come to him

<s>  Who can open the doors of his face ? </s>
<s> his
teeth are terrible round about . </s>
<s> His scales are his pride , shut up together as with a close seal . </s>
<s> One is so near to another , that no air can come between them . </s>
<s> They are joined one to another , they stick together , that they
cannot be sundered . </s>
<s> By his neesings a light doth shine , and his eyes are like the
eyelids of the morning . </s>
<s> Out of his mouth go burning lamps , and sparks of fire leap out . </s>
<s> Out of his nostrils goeth smoke , as out of a seething pot or
caldron . </s>
<s> His breath kindleth coals , and a flame goeth out of his mouth . </s>
<s> In his neck remaineth strength , and sorrow is turned into joy
before him . </s>
<s> The flakes of his flesh are joined together : they are firm in
themselves ; they cannot be moved . </s>
<s> His heart is as firm as a stone ; yea , as hard as a piece of the
nether millstone . </s>
<s> When he raiseth up himself , the mighty are afraid : by reason of
breakings they purify themselves . </s>
<s> The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold : the spear , the
dart , nor the habergeon . </s>
<s> He esteemeth iron as straw , and brass as rotten wood . </s>
<s> The arrow cannot make him flee : slingstones are turned with him
into stubble . </s>
<s> Darts are counted as stubble : he laugheth at the shaking of a
spear . </s>
<s> Sharp stones are under him : he spreadeth sharp pointed things
upon the mire . </s>
<s> He maketh the deep to boil like a pot : he maketh the sea like a
pot of ointment . </s>
<s> He maketh a path to shine after him ; one would think the deep to
be hoary . </s>
<s> Upon earth there is not his like , who is made without fear . </s>
<s> He beholdeth all high things : he is a king over all the children
of pride . </s>
<s> Then Job answered the LORD , and said , I know that thou canst
do every thing , and that no thought can be withholden from thee . </s>
<s> Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge ? </s>
<s> therefore have I
uttered that I understood not ; things too wonderful for me , which I
knew not . </s>
<s> Hear , I beseech thee , and I will speak : I will demand of thee ,
and declare thou unto me . </s>
<s> I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear : but now mine eye
seeth thee . </s>
<s> Wherefore I abhor myself , and repent in dust and ashes . </s>
<s> And it was so , that after the LORD had spoken these words unto
Job , the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite , My wrath is kindled
against thee , and against thy two friends : for ye have not spoken of
me the thing that is right , as my servant Job hath . </s>
<s> Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams , and go
to my servant Job , and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering ; and
my servant Job shall pray for you : for him will I accept : lest I deal
with you after your folly , in that ye have not spoken of me the thing
which is right , like my servant Job . </s>
<s> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
Naamathite went , and did according as the LORD commanded them : the
LORD also accepted Job . </s>
<s> And the LORD turned the captivity of Job , when he prayed for his
friends : also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before . </s>
<s> Then came there unto him all his brethren , and all his sisters ,
and all they that had been of his acquaintance before , and did eat
bread with him in his house : and they bemoaned him , and comforted him
over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him : every man also
gave him a piece of money , and every one an earring of gold . </s>
<s> So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his
beginning : for he had fourteen thousand sheep , and six thousand
camels , and a thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand she asses . </s>
<s> He had also seven sons and three daughters . </s>
<s> And he called the name of the first , Jemima ; and the name of the
second , Kezia ; and the name of the third , Kerenhappuch . </s>
<s> And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters
of Job : and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren . </s>
<s> After this lived Job an hundred and forty years , and saw his
sons , and his sons ' sons , even four generations . </s>
<s> So Job died , being old and full of days . </s>

compass me about . </s>
<s> They are inclosed in their own fat : with their mouth they speak
proudly . </s>
<s> They have now compassed us in our steps : they have set their
eyes bowing down to the earth ;

 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey , and as it were a
young lion lurking in secret places . </s>
<s> Arise , O LORD , disappoint him , cast him down : deliver my soul
from the wicked , which is thy sword :

 From men which are thy hand , O LORD , from men of the world ,
which have their portion in this life , and whose belly thou fillest
with thy hid treasure : they are full of children , and leave the rest
of their substance to their babes . </s>
<s> As for me , I will behold thy face in righteousness : I shall be
satisfied , when I awake , with thy likeness . </s>
<s> I will love thee , O LORD , my strength . </s>
<s> The LORD is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God ,
my strength , in whom I will trust ; my buckler , and the horn of my
salvation , and my high tower . </s>
<s> I will call upon the LORD , who is worthy to be praised : so shall
I be saved from mine enemies . </s>
<s> The sorrows of death compassed me , and the floods of ungodly men
made me afraid . </s>
<s> The sorrows of hell compassed me about : the snares of death
prevented me . </s>
<s> In my distress I called upon the LORD , and cried unto my God : he
heard my voice out of his temple , and my cry came before him , even
into his ears . </s>
<s> Then the earth shook and trembled ; the foundations also of the
hills moved and were shaken , because he was wroth . </s>
<s> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils , and fire out of his
mouth devoured : coals were kindled by it . </s>
<s> He bowed the heavens also , and came down : and darkness was under
his feet . </s>
<s> And he rode upon a cherub , and did fly : yea , he did fly upon the
wings of the wind . </s>
<s> He made darkness his secret place ; his pavilion round about him
were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies . </s>
<s> At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed ,
hail stones and coals of fire . </s>
<s> The LORD also thundered in the heavens , and the Highest gave his
voice ; hail stones and coals of fire . </s>
<s> Yea , he sent out his arrows , and scattered them ; and he shot out
lightnings , and discomfited them . </s>
<s> Then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of
the world were discovered at thy rebuke , O LORD , at the blast of the
breath of thy nostrils . </s>
<s> He sent from above , he took me , he drew me out of many waters . </s>
<s> He delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them which hated
me : for they were too strong for me . </s>
<s> They prevented me in the day of my calamity : but the LORD was my
stay . </s>
<s> He brought me forth also into a large place ; he delivered me ,
because he delighted in me . </s>
<s> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness ; according to
the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me . </s>
<s> For I have kept the ways of the LORD , and have not wickedly
departed from my God . </s>
<s> For all his judgments were before me , and I did not put away his
statutes from me . </s>
<s> I was also upright before him , and I kept myself from mine
iniquity . </s>
<s> Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
righteousness , according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight . </s>
<s> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful ; with an
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright ;

 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure ; and with the froward
thou wilt shew thyself froward . </s>
<s> For thou wilt save the afflicted people ; but wilt bring down
high looks . </s>
<s> For thou wilt light my candle : the LORD my God will enlighten my
darkness . </s>
<s> For by thee I have run through a troop ; and by my God have I
leaped over a wall . </s>
<s> As for God , his way is perfect : the word of the LORD is tried :
he is a buckler to all those that trust in him . </s>
<s> For who is God save the LORD ? </s>
<s> or who is a rock save our God ? </s>
<s> It is God that girdeth me with strength , and maketh my way
perfect . </s>
<s> He maketh my feet like hinds ' feet , and setteth me upon my high
places . </s>
<s> He teacheth my hands to war , so that a bow of steel is broken by
mine arms . </s>
<s> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation : and thy
right hand hath holden me up , and thy gentleness hath made me great . </s>
<s> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me , that my feet did not slip . </s>
<s> I have pursued mine enemies , and overtaken them : neither did I
turn again till they were consumed . </s>
<s> I have wounded them that they were not able to rise : they are
fallen under my feet . </s>
<s> For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle : thou hast
subdued under me those that rose up against me . </s>
<s> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies ; that I might
destroy them that hate me . </s>
<s> They cried , but there was none to save them : even unto the LORD ,
but he answered them not . </s>
<s> Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind : I did
cast them out as the dirt in the streets . </s>
<s> Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people ; and
thou hast made me the head of the heathen : a people whom I have not
known shall serve me . </s>
<s> As soon as they hear of me , they shall obey me : the strangers
shall submit themselves unto me . </s>
<s> The strangers shall fade away , and be afraid out of their close
places . </s>
<s> The LORD liveth ; and blessed be my rock ; and let the God of my
salvation be exalted . </s>
<s> It is God that avengeth me , and subdueth the people under me . </s>
<s> He delivereth me from mine enemies : yea , thou liftest me up
above those that rise up against me : thou hast delivered me from the
violent man . </s>
<s> Therefore will I give thanks unto thee , O LORD , among the
heathen , and sing praises unto thy name . </s>
<s> Great deliverance giveth he to his king ; and sheweth mercy to
his anointed , to David , and to his seed for evermore . </s>
<s> The heavens declare the glory of God ; and the firmament sheweth
his handywork . </s>
<s> Day unto day uttereth speech , and night unto night sheweth
knowledge . </s>
<s> There is no speech nor language , where their voice is not heard . </s>
<s> Their line is gone out through all the earth , and their words to
the end of the world . </s>
<s> In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun ,

 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber , and rejoiceth
as a strong man to run a race . </s>
<s> His going forth is from the end of the heaven , and his circuit
unto the ends of it : and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof . </s>
<s> The law of the LORD is perfect , converting the soul : the
testimony of the LORD is sure , making wise the simple . </s>
<s> The statutes of the LORD are right , rejoicing the heart : the
commandment of the LORD is pure , enlightening the eyes . </s>
<s> The fear of the LORD is clean , enduring for ever : the judgments
of the LORD are true and righteous altogether . </s>
<s> More to be desired are they than gold , yea , than much fine gold :
sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb . </s>
<s> Moreover by them is thy servant warned : and in keeping of them
there is great reward . </s>
<s> Who can understand his errors ? </s>
<s> cleanse thou me from secret
faults . </s>
<s> Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins ; let them not
have dominion over me : then shall I be upright , and I shall be
innocent from the great transgression . </s>
<s> Let the words of my mouth , and the meditation of my heart , be
acceptable in thy sight , O LORD , my strength , and my redeemer . </s>
<s> The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble ; the name of the God of
Jacob defend thee ;

 Send thee help from the sanctuary , and strengthen thee out of
Zion ;

 Remember all thy offerings , and accept thy burnt sacrifice ;
Selah . </s>
<s> Grant thee according to thine own heart , and fulfil all thy
counsel . </s>
<s> We will rejoice in thy salvation , and in the name of our God we
will set up our banners : the LORD fulfil all thy petitions . </s>
<s> Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed ; he will hear him
from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand . </s>
<s> Some trust in chariots , and some in horses : but we will remember
the name of the LORD our God . </s>
<s> They are brought down and fallen : but we are risen , and stand
upright . </s>
<s> Save , LORD : let the king hear us when we call . </s>
<s> The king shall joy in thy strength , O LORD ; and in thy salvation
how greatly shall he rejoice ! </s>
<s> Thou hast given him his heart 's desire , and hast not withholden
the request of his lips . </s>
<s> Selah . </s>
<s> For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness : thou
settest a crown of pure gold on his head . </s>
<s> He asked life of thee , and thou gavest it him , even length of
days for ever and ever . </s>
<s> His glory is great in thy salvation : honour and majesty hast thou
laid upon him . </s>
<s> For thou hast made him most blessed for ever : thou hast made him
exceeding glad with thy countenance . </s>
<s> For the king trusteth in the LORD , and through the mercy of the
most High he shall not be moved . </s>
<s> Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies : thy right hand shall
find out those that hate thee . </s>
<s> Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger :
the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath , and the fire shall devour
them . </s>
<s> Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth , and their seed
from among the children of men . </s>
<s> For they intended evil against thee : they imagined a mischievous
device , which they are not able to perform . </s>
<s> Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back , when thou shalt
make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them . </s>
<s> Be thou exalted , LORD , in thine own strength : so will we sing
and praise thy power . </s>
<s> My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? </s>
<s> why art thou so far
from helping me , and from the words of my roaring ? </s>
<s> O my God , I cry in the day time , but thou hearest not ; and in the
night season , and am not silent . </s>
<s> But thou art holy , O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel . </s>
<s> Our fathers trusted in thee : they trusted , and thou didst deliver
them . </s>
<s> They cried unto thee , and were delivered : they trusted in thee ,
and were not confounded . </s>
<s> But I am a worm , and no man ; a reproach of men , and despised of
the people . </s>
<s> All they that see me laugh me to scorn : they shoot out the lip ,
they shake the head , saying ,

 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him : let him deliver
him , seeing he delighted in him . </s>
<s> But thou art he that took me out of the womb : thou didst make me
hope when I was upon my mother 's breasts . </s>
<s> I was cast upon thee from the womb : thou art my God from my
mother 's belly . </s>
<s> Be not far from me ; for trouble is near ; for there is none to
help . </s>
<s> Many bulls have compassed me : strong bulls of Bashan have beset
me round . </s>
<s> They gaped upon me with their mouths , as a ravening and a
roaring lion . </s>
<s> I am poured out like water , and all my bones are out of joint :
my heart is like wax ; it is melted in the midst of my bowels . </s>
<s> My strength is dried up like a potsherd ; and my tongue cleaveth
to my jaws ; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death . </s>
<s> For dogs have compassed me : the assembly of the wicked have
inclosed me : they pierced my hands and my feet . </s>
<s> I may tell all my bones : they look and stare upon me . </s>
<s> They part my garments among them , and cast lots upon my vesture . </s>
<s> But be not thou far from me , O LORD : O my strength , haste thee
to help me . </s>
<s> Deliver my soul from the sword ; my darling from the power of the
dog . </s>
<s> Save me from the lion 's mouth : for thou hast heard me from the
horns of the unicorns . </s>
<s> I will declare thy name unto my brethren : in the midst of the
congregation will I praise thee . </s>
<s> Ye that fear the LORD , praise him ; all ye the seed of Jacob ,
glorify him ; and fear him , all ye the seed of Israel . </s>
<s> For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
afflicted ; neither hath he hid his face from him ; but when he cried
unto him , he heard . </s>

my vows before them that fear him . </s>
<s> The meek shall eat and be satisfied : they shall praise the LORD
that seek him : your heart shall live for ever . </s>

nations . </s>

<s> Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I
will fear no evil : for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they
comfort me . </s>
<s> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies :
thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over . </s>

I will sing , yea , I will sing praises unto the LORD . </s>
<s> Hear , O LORD , when I cry with my voice : have mercy also upon me ,

salvation . </s>
<s> When my father and my mother forsake me , then the LORD will take
me up . </s>
<s> Teach me thy way , O LORD , and lead me in a plain path , because
of mine enemies . </s>

LORD in the land of the living . </s>
<s> Wait on the LORD : be of good courage , and he shall strengthen

<s> Draw me not away with the wicked , and with the workers of
iniquity , which speak peace to their neighbours , but mischief is in

<s> Give them according to their deeds , and according to the
wickedness of their endeavours : give them after the work of their
hands ; render to them their desert . </s>

of his hands , he shall destroy them , and not build them up . </s>
<s> Blessed be the LORD , because he hath heard the voice of my
supplications . </s>
<s> The LORD is my strength and my shield ; my heart trusted in him ,

<s> I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind : I am like a broken

<s> Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
pride of man : thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the
strife of tongues . </s>
<s> Blessed be the LORD : for he hath shewed me his marvellous
kindness in a strong city . </s>

truth . </s>

world stand in awe of him . </s>
<s> For he spake , and it was done ; he commanded , and it stood fast . </s>

heart to all generations . </s>
<s> Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD ; and the people whom

<s> An horse is a vain thing for safety : neither shall he deliver
any by his great strength . </s>
<s> Behold , the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him , upon

famine . </s>
<s> Our soul waiteth for the LORD : he is our help and our shield . </s>

famine they shall be satisfied . </s>

<s> Depart from evil , and do good ; and dwell for evermore . </s>
<s> For the LORD loveth judgment , and forsaketh not his saints ; they

talketh of judgment . </s>
<s> The law of his God is in his heart ; none of his steps shall
slide . </s>
<s> The wicked watcheth the righteous , and seeketh to slay him . </s>
<s> The LORD will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he
is judged . </s>
<s> Wait on the LORD , and keep his way , and he shall exalt thee to
inherit the land : when the wicked are cut off , thou shalt see it . </s>

like a green bay tree . </s>

the wicked shall be cut off . </s>
<s> But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD : he is their
strength in the time of trouble . </s>
<s> And the LORD shall help them , and deliver them : he shall deliver
them from the wicked , and save them , because they trust in him . </s>
<s> O lord , rebuke me not in thy wrath : neither chasten me in thy hot
displeasure . </s>
<s> For thine arrows stick fast in me , and thy hand presseth me sore . </s>
<s> There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger ; neither
is there any rest in my bones because of my sin . </s>

they are too heavy for me . </s>
<s> My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness . </s>
<s> I am troubled ; I am bowed down greatly ; I go mourning all the day
long . </s>
<s> For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease : and there is no
soundness in my flesh . </s>
<s> I am feeble and sore broken : I have roared by reason of the
disquietness of my heart . </s>
<s> Lord , all my desire is before thee ; and my groaning is not hid
from thee . </s>
<s> My heart panteth , my strength faileth me : as for the light of
mine eyes , it also is gone from me . </s>
<s> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore ; and my
kinsmen stand afar off . </s>
<s> They also that seek after my life lay snares for me : and they
that seek my hurt speak mischievous things , and imagine deceits all
the day long . </s>
<s> But I , as a deaf man , heard not ; and I was as a dumb man that
openeth not his mouth . </s>
<s> Thus I was as a man that heareth not , and in whose mouth are no
reproofs . </s>
<s> For in thee , O LORD , do I hope : thou wilt hear , O Lord my God . </s>
<s> For I said , Hear me , lest otherwise they should rejoice over me :
when my foot slippeth , they magnify themselves against me . </s>
<s> For I am ready to halt , and my sorrow is continually before me . </s>
<s> For I will declare mine iniquity ; I will be sorry for my sin . </s>
<s> But mine enemies are lively , and they are strong : and they that
hate me wrongfully are multiplied . </s>
<s> They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries ;

<s> Forsake me not , O LORD : O my God , be not far from me . </s>
<s> Make haste to help me , O Lord my salvation . </s>
<s> I said , I will take heed to my ways , that I sin not with my
tongue : I will keep my mouth with a bridle , while the wicked is before
me . </s>
<s> I was dumb with silence , I held my peace , even from good ; and my
sorrow was stirred . </s>
<s> My heart was hot within me , while I was musing the fire burned :
then spake I with my tongue ,

 LORD , make me to know mine end , and the measure of my days , what
it is : that I may know how frail I am . </s>
<s> Behold , thou hast made my days as an handbreadth ; and mine age is
as nothing before thee : verily every man at his best state is
altogether vanity . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> Surely every man walketh in a vain shew : surely they are
disquieted in vain : he heapeth up riches , and knoweth not who shall
gather them . </s>
<s> And now , Lord , what wait I for ? </s>
<s> my hope is in thee . </s>
<s> Deliver me from all my transgressions : make me not the reproach
of the foolish . </s>
<s> I was dumb , I opened not my mouth ; because thou didst it . </s>
<s> Remove thy stroke away from me : I am consumed by the blow of
thine hand . </s>
<s> When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity , thou
makest his beauty to consume away like a moth : surely every man is
vanity . </s>
<s> Selah . </s>
<s> Hear my prayer , O LORD , and give ear unto my cry ; hold not thy
peace at my tears : for I am a stranger with thee , and a sojourner , as
all my fathers were . </s>
<s> O spare me , that I may recover strength , before I go hence , and
be no more . </s>
<s> I waited patiently for the LORD ; and he inclined unto me , and
heard my cry . </s>
<s> He brought me up also out of an horrible pit , out of the miry
clay , and set my feet upon a rock , and established my goings . </s>
<s> And he hath put a new song in my mouth , even praise unto our God :
many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in the LORD . </s>
<s> Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust , and
respecteth not the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies . </s>
<s> Many , O LORD my God , are thy wonderful works which thou hast
done , and thy thoughts which are to us-ward : they cannot be reckoned
up in order unto thee : if I would declare and speak of them , they are
more than can be numbered . </s>
<s> Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire ; mine ears hast thou
opened : burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required . </s>
<s> Then said I , Lo , I come : in the volume of the book it is written
of me ,

heart . </s>
<s> I have preached righteousness in the great congregation : lo , I
have not refrained my lips , O LORD , thou knowest . </s>

declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation : I have not concealed thy
lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation . </s>
<s> Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me , O LORD : let thy
lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me . </s>
<s> For innumerable evils have compassed me about : mine iniquities
have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are
more than the hairs of mine head : therefore my heart faileth me . </s>
<s> Be pleased , O LORD , to deliver me : O LORD , make haste to help
me . </s>
<s> Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
soul to destroy it ; let them be driven backward and put to shame that
wish me evil . </s>
<s> Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
me , Aha , aha . </s>
<s> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : let
such as love thy salvation say continually , The LORD be magnified . </s>
<s> But I am poor and needy ; yet the Lord thinketh upon me : thou art
my help and my deliverer ; make no tarrying , O my God . </s>
<s> Blessed is he that considereth the poor : the LORD will deliver
him in time of trouble . </s>
<s> The LORD will preserve him , and keep him alive ; and he shall be
blessed upon the earth : and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of
his enemies . </s>
<s> The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing : thou
wilt make all his bed in his sickness . </s>
<s> I said , LORD , be merciful unto me : heal my soul ; for I have
sinned against thee . </s>
<s> Mine enemies speak evil of me , When shall he die , and his name
perish ? </s>
<s> And if he come to see me , he speaketh vanity : his heart gathereth
iniquity to itself ; when he goeth abroad , he telleth it . </s>
<s> All that hate me whisper together against me : against me do they
devise my hurt . </s>
<s> An evil disease , say they , cleaveth fast unto him : and now that
he lieth he shall rise up no more . </s>
<s> Yea , mine own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , which did eat
of my bread , hath lifted up his heel against me . </s>
<s> But thou , O LORD , be merciful unto me , and raise me up , that I
may requite them . </s>
<s> By this I know that thou favourest me , because mine enemy doth
not triumph over me . </s>
<s> And as for me , thou upholdest me in mine integrity , and settest
me before thy face for ever . </s>
<s> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting , and to
everlasting . </s>
<s> Amen , and Amen . </s>

remember thee from the land of Jordan , and of the Hermonites , from the
hill Mizar . </s>
<s> Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts : all thy
waves and thy billows are gone over me . </s>
<s> Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time , and

my life . </s>

us spoil for themselves . </s>

scattered us among the heathen . </s>

wealth by their price . </s>

derision to them that are round about us . </s>

old ; lo , he doth send out his voice , and that a mighty voice . </s>
<s> Ascribe ye strength unto God : his excellency is over Israel , and
his strength is in the clouds . </s>
<s> O God , thou art terrible out of thy holy places : the God of
Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people . </s>
<s> Blessed
be God . </s>
<s> Save me , O God ; for the waters are come in unto my soul . </s>
<s> I sink in deep mire , where there is no standing : I am come into
deep waters , where the floods overflow me . </s>
<s> I am weary of my crying : my throat is dried : mine eyes fail while
I wait for my God . </s>
<s> They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine
head : they that would destroy me , being mine enemies wrongfully , are
mighty : then I restored that which I took not away . </s>
<s> O God , thou knowest my foolishness ; and my sins are not hid from
thee . </s>
<s> Let not them that wait on thee , O Lord GOD of hosts , be ashamed
for my sake : let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake , O
God of Israel . </s>
<s> Because for thy sake I have borne reproach ; shame hath covered my
face . </s>
<s> I am become a stranger unto my brethren , and an alien unto my
mother 's children . </s>
<s> For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up ; and the reproaches
of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me . </s>
<s> When I wept , and chastened my soul with fasting , that was to my
reproach . </s>
<s> I made sackcloth also my garment ; and I became a proverb to
them . </s>
<s> They that sit in the gate speak against me ; and I was the song
of the drunkards . </s>
<s> But as for me , my prayer is unto thee , O LORD , in an acceptable
time : O God , in the multitude of thy mercy hear me , in the truth of
thy salvation . </s>
<s> Deliver me out of the mire , and let me not sink : let me be
delivered from them that hate me , and out of the deep waters . </s>
<s> Let not the waterflood overflow me , neither let the deep swallow
me up , and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me . </s>
<s> Hear me , O LORD ; for thy lovingkindness is good : turn unto me
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies . </s>
<s> And hide not thy face from thy servant ; for I am in trouble :
hear me speedily . </s>
<s> Draw nigh unto my soul , and redeem it : deliver me because of
mine enemies . </s>
<s> Thou hast known my reproach , and my shame , and my dishonour :
mine adversaries are all before thee . </s>
<s> Reproach hath broken my heart ; and I am full of heaviness : and I
looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; and for comforters ,
but I found none . </s>
<s> They gave me also gall for my meat ; and in my thirst they gave
me vinegar to drink . </s>
<s> Let their table become a snare before them : and that which
should have been for their welfare , let it become a trap . </s>
<s> Let their eyes be darkened , that they see not ; and make their
loins continually to shake . </s>
<s> Pour out thine indignation upon them , and let thy wrathful anger
take hold of them . </s>
<s> Let their habitation be desolate ; and let none dwell in their
tents . </s>
<s> For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten ; and they talk to
the grief of those whom thou hast wounded . </s>
<s> Add iniquity unto their iniquity : and let them not come into thy
righteousness . </s>
<s> Let them be blotted out of the book of the living , and not be
written with the righteous . </s>
<s> But I am poor and sorrowful : let thy salvation , O God , set me up
on high . </s>
<s> I will praise the name of God with a song , and will magnify him
with thanksgiving . </s>
<s> This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
that hath horns and hoofs . </s>
<s> The humble shall see this , and be glad : and your heart shall
live that seek God . </s>
<s> For the LORD heareth the poor , and despiseth not his prisoners . </s>
<s> Let the heaven and earth praise him , the seas , and every thing
that moveth therein . </s>
<s> For God will save Zion , and will build the cities of Judah : that
they may dwell there , and have it in possession . </s>
<s> The seed also of his servants shall inherit it : and they that
love his name shall dwell therein . </s>
<s> MAKE HASTE , O GOD , TO DELIVER ME ; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME , O LORD . </s>
<s> Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul : let
them be turned backward , and put to confusion , that desire my hurt . </s>
<s> Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say ,
Aha , aha . </s>
<s> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : and let
such as love thy salvation say continually , Let God be magnified . </s>
<s> But I am poor and needy : make haste unto me , O God : thou art my
help and my deliverer ; O LORD , make no tarrying . </s>
<s> In thee , O LORD , do I put my trust : let me never be put to
confusion . </s>
<s> Deliver me in thy righteousness , and cause me to escape : incline
thine ear unto me , and save me . </s>
<s> Be thou my strong habitation , whereunto I may continually resort :
thou hast given commandment to save me ; for thou art my rock and my
fortress . </s>
<s> Deliver me , O my God , out of the hand of the wicked , out of the
hand of the unrighteous and cruel man . </s>
<s> For thou art my hope , O Lord GOD : thou art my trust from my
youth . </s>
<s> By thee have I been holden up from the womb : thou art he that
took me out of my mother 's bowels : my praise shall be continually of
thee . </s>
<s> I am as a wonder unto many ; but thou art my strong refuge . </s>
<s> Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
the day . </s>
<s> Cast me not off in the time of old age ; forsake me not when my
strength faileth . </s>
<s> For mine enemies speak against me ; and they that lay wait for my
soul take counsel together ,

 Saying , God hath forsaken him : persecute and take him ; for there
is none to deliver him . </s>
<s> O God , be not far from me : O my God , make haste for my help . </s>
<s> Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
soul ; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my
hurt . </s>
<s> But I will hope continually , and will yet praise thee more and
more . </s>
<s> My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
all the day ; for I know not the numbers thereof . </s>
<s> I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD : I will make mention
of thy righteousness , even of thine only . </s>
<s> O God , thou hast taught me from my youth : and hitherto have I
declared thy wondrous works . </s>
<s> Now also when I am old and greyheaded , O God , forsake me not ;
until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation , and thy power
to every one that is to come . </s>
<s> Thy righteousness also , O God , is very high , who hast done great
things : O God , who is like unto thee ! </s>
<s> Thou , which hast shewed me great and sore troubles , shalt
quicken me again , and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the
earth . </s>
<s> Thou shalt increase my greatness , and comfort me on every side . </s>
<s> I will also praise thee with the psaltery , even thy truth , O my
God : unto thee will I sing with the harp , O thou Holy One of Israel . </s>
<s> My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee ; and my
soul , which thou hast redeemed . </s>
<s> My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long :
for they are confounded , for they are brought unto shame , that seek my
hurt . </s>
<s> Give the king thy judgments , O God , and thy righteousness unto
the king 's son . </s>
<s> He shall judge thy people with righteousness , and thy poor with
judgment . </s>
<s> The mountains shall bring peace to the people , and the little
hills , by righteousness . </s>
<s> He shall judge the poor of the people , he shall save the children
of the needy , and shall break in pieces the oppressor . </s>
<s> They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure ,
throughout all generations . </s>
<s> He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass : as showers that
water the earth . </s>
<s> In his days shall the righteous flourish ; and abundance of peace
so long as the moon endureth . </s>
<s> He shall have dominion also from sea to sea , and from the river
unto the ends of the earth . </s>
<s> They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him ; and his
enemies shall lick the dust . </s>
<s> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents : the
kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts . </s>
<s> Yea , all kings shall fall down before him : all nations shall
serve him . </s>
<s> For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth ; the poor also ,
and him that hath no helper . </s>
<s> He shall spare the poor and needy , and shall save the souls of
the needy . </s>
<s> He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence : and
precious shall their blood be in his sight . </s>
<s> And he shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of
Sheba : prayer also shall be made for him continually ; and daily shall
he be praised . </s>
<s> There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
the mountains ; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon : and they of
the city shall flourish like grass of the earth . </s>
<s> His name shall endure for ever : his name shall be continued as
long as the sun : and men shall be blessed in him : all nations shall
call him blessed . </s>
<s> Blessed be the LORD God , the God of Israel , who only doeth
wondrous things . </s>
<s> And blessed be his glorious name for ever : and let the whole
earth be filled with his glory ; Amen , and Amen . </s>
<s> The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended . </s>
<s> Truly God is good to Israel , even to such as are of a clean
heart . </s>
<s> But as for me , my feet were almost gone ; my steps had well nigh
slipped . </s>
<s> For I was envious at the foolish , when I saw the prosperity of
the wicked . </s>
<s> For there are no bands in their death : but their strength is
firm . </s>
<s> They are not in trouble as other men ; neither are they plagued
like other men . </s>
<s> Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain ; violence
covereth them as a garment . </s>
<s> Their eyes stand out with fatness : they have more than heart
could wish . </s>
<s> They are corrupt , and speak wickedly concerning oppression : they
speak loftily . </s>
<s> They set their mouth against the heavens , and their tongue
walketh through the earth . </s>
<s> Therefore his people return hither : and waters of a full cup are
wrung out to them . </s>
<s> And they say , How doth God know ? </s>
<s> and is there knowledge in the
most High ? </s>
<s> Behold , these are the ungodly , who prosper in the world ; they
increase in riches . </s>
<s> Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain , and washed my hands in
innocency . </s>
<s> For all the day long have I been plagued , and chastened every
morning . </s>
<s> If I say , I will speak thus ; behold , I should offend against the
generation of thy children . </s>
<s> When I thought to know this , it was too painful for me ;

 Until I went into the sanctuary of God ; then understood I their
end . </s>
<s> Surely thou didst set them in slippery places : thou castedst
them down into destruction . </s>
<s> How are they brought into desolation , as in a moment ! </s>
<s> they are
utterly consumed with terrors . </s>
<s> As a dream when one awaketh ; so , O Lord , when thou awakest , thou
shalt despise their image . </s>
<s> Thus my heart was grieved , and I was pricked in my reins . </s>
<s> So foolish was I , and ignorant : I was as a beast before thee . </s>
<s> Nevertheless I am continually with thee : thou hast holden me by
my right hand . </s>
<s> Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel , and afterward receive me
to glory . </s>
<s> Whom have I in heaven but thee ? </s>
<s> and there is none upon earth
that I desire beside thee . </s>
<s> My flesh and my heart faileth : but God is the strength of my
heart , and my portion for ever . </s>
<s> For , lo , they that are far from thee shall perish : thou hast
destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee . </s>
<s> But it is good for me to draw near to God : I have put my trust
in the Lord GOD , that I may declare all thy works . </s>
<s> O God , why hast thou cast us off for ever ? </s>
<s> why doth thine anger
smoke against the sheep of thy pasture ? </s>
<s> Remember thy congregation , which thou hast purchased of old ; the
rod of thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed ; this mount Zion ,
wherein thou hast dwelt . </s>
<s> Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations ; even all that
the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary . </s>
<s> Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations ; they set up
their ensigns for signs . </s>
<s> A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
thick trees . </s>
<s> But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes
and hammers . </s>
<s> They have cast fire into thy sanctuary , they have defiled by
casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground . </s>
<s> They said in their hearts , Let us destroy them together : they
have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land . </s>
<s> We see not our signs : there is no more any prophet : neither is
there among us any that knoweth how long . </s>
<s> O God , how long shall the adversary reproach ? </s>
<s> shall the enemy
blaspheme thy name for ever ? </s>
<s> Why withdrawest thou thy hand , even thy right hand ? </s>
<s> pluck it out
of thy bosom . </s>
<s> For God is my King of old , working salvation in the midst of the
earth . </s>
<s> Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength : thou brakest the
heads of the dragons in the waters . </s>
<s> Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces , and gavest him to
be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness . </s>
<s> Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood : thou driedst up
mighty rivers . </s>
<s> The day is thine , the night also is thine : thou hast prepared
the light and the sun . </s>
<s> Thou hast set all the borders of the earth : thou hast made
summer and winter . </s>
<s> Remember this , that the enemy hath reproached , O LORD , and that
the foolish people have blasphemed thy name . </s>
<s> O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
the wicked : forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever . </s>
<s> Have respect unto the covenant : for the dark places of the earth
are full of the habitations of cruelty . </s>
<s> O let not the oppressed return ashamed : let the poor and needy
praise thy name . </s>
<s> Arise , O God , plead thine own cause : remember how the foolish
man reproacheth thee daily . </s>
<s> Forget not the voice of thine enemies : the tumult of those that
rise up against thee increaseth continually . </s>
<s> Unto thee , O God , do we give thanks , unto thee do we give thanks :
for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare . </s>
<s> When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly . </s>
<s> The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved : I bear
up the pillars of it . </s>
<s> Selah . </s>
<s> I said unto the fools , Deal not foolishly : and to the wicked ,
Lift not up the horn :

 Lift not up your horn on high : speak not with a stiff neck . </s>
<s> For promotion cometh neither from the east , nor from the west ,
nor from the south . </s>
<s> But God is the judge : he putteth down one , and setteth up
another . </s>
<s> For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup , and the wine is red ;
it is full of mixture ; and he poureth out of the same : but the dregs
thereof , all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out , and drink
them . </s>
<s> But I will declare for ever ; I will sing praises to the God of
Jacob . </s>
<s> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off ; but the horns
of the righteous shall be exalted . </s>
<s> In Judah is God known : his name is great in Israel . </s>
<s> In Salem also is his tabernacle , and his dwelling place in Zion . </s>
<s> There brake he the arrows of the bow , the shield , and the sword ,
and the battle . </s>
<s> Selah . </s>
<s> Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey . </s>
<s> The stouthearted are spoiled , they have slept their sleep : and
none of the men of might have found their hands . </s>
<s> At thy rebuke , O God of Jacob , both the chariot and horse are
cast into a dead sleep . </s>
<s> Thou , even thou , art to be feared : and who may stand in thy sight
when once thou art angry ? </s>
<s> Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven ; the earth
feared , and was still ,

 When God arose to judgment , to save all the meek of the earth . </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee : the remainder of
wrath shalt thou restrain . </s>
<s> Vow , and pay unto the LORD your God : let all that be round about
him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared . </s>
<s> He shall cut off the spirit of princes : he is terrible to the
kings of the earth . </s>
<s> I cried unto God with my voice , even unto God with my voice ; and
he gave ear unto me . </s>
<s> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord : my sore ran in the
night , and ceased not : my soul refused to be comforted . </s>
<s> I remembered God , and was troubled : I complained , and my spirit
was overwhelmed . </s>
<s> Selah . </s>
<s> Thou holdest mine eyes waking : I am so troubled that I cannot
speak . </s>
<s> I have considered the days of old , the years of ancient times . </s>
<s> I call to remembrance my song in the night : I commune with mine
own heart : and my spirit made diligent search . </s>
<s> Will the Lord cast off for ever ? </s>
<s> and will he be favourable no
more ? </s>
<s> Is his mercy clean gone for ever ? </s>
<s> doth his promise fail for
evermore ? </s>
<s> Hath God forgotten to be gracious ? </s>
<s> hath he in anger shut up his
tender mercies ? </s>
<s> Selah . </s>
<s> And I said , This is my infirmity : but I will remember the years
of the right hand of the most High . </s>
<s> I will remember the works of the LORD : surely I will remember
thy wonders of old . </s>
<s> I will meditate also of all thy work , and talk of thy doings . </s>
<s> Thy way , O God , is in the sanctuary : who is so great a God as
our God ? </s>
<s> Thou art the God that doest wonders : thou hast declared thy
strength among the people . </s>
<s> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people , the sons of Jacob
and Joseph . </s>
<s> Selah . </s>
<s> The waters saw thee , O God , the waters saw thee ; they were
afraid : the depths also were troubled . </s>
<s> The clouds poured out water : the skies sent out a sound : thine
arrows also went abroad . </s>
<s> The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven : the lightnings
lightened the world : the earth trembled and shook . </s>
<s> Thy way is in the sea , and thy path in the great waters , and thy
footsteps are not known . </s>
<s> Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
Aaron . </s>
<s> Give ear , O my people , to my law : incline your ears to the words
of my mouth . </s>
<s> I will open my mouth in a parable : I will utter dark sayings of
old :

 Which we have heard and known , and our fathers have told us . </s>
<s> We will not hide them from their children , shewing to the
generation to come the praises of the LORD , and his strength , and his
wonderful works that he hath done . </s>
<s> For he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a law in
Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them
known to their children :

 That the generation to come might know them , even the children
which should be born ; who should arise and declare them to their
children :

 That they might set their hope in God , and not forget the works
of God , but keep his commandments :

 And might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious
generation ; a generation that set not their heart aright , and whose
spirit was not stedfast with God . </s>
<s> The children of Ephraim , being armed , and carrying bows , turned
back in the day of battle . </s>
<s> They kept not the covenant of God , and refused to walk in his
law ;

 And forgat his works , and his wonders that he had shewed them . </s>
<s> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers , in the
land of Egypt , in the field of Zoan . </s>
<s> He divided the sea , and caused them to pass through ; and he made
the waters to stand as an heap . </s>
<s> In the daytime also he led them with a cloud , and all the night
with a light of fire . </s>
<s> He clave the rocks in the wilderness , and gave them drink as out
of the great depths . </s>
<s> He brought streams also out of the rock , and caused waters to
run down like rivers . </s>
<s> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High
in the wilderness . </s>
<s> And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
lust . </s>
<s> Yea , they spake against God ; they said , Can God furnish a table
in the wilderness ? </s>
<s> Behold , he smote the rock , that the waters gushed out , and the
streams overflowed ; can he give bread also ? </s>
<s> can he provide flesh for
his people ? </s>
<s> Therefore the LORD heard this , and was wroth : so a fire was
kindled against Jacob , and anger also came up against Israel ;

 Because they believed not in God , and trusted not in his
salvation :

 Though he had commanded the clouds from above , and opened the
doors of heaven ,

 And had rained down manna upon them to eat , and had given them
of the corn of heaven . </s>
<s> Man did eat angels ' food : he sent them meat to the full . </s>
<s> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven : and by his power
he brought in the south wind . </s>
<s> He rained flesh also upon them as dust , and feathered fowls like
as the sand of the sea :

 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp , round about their
habitations . </s>
<s> So they did eat , and were well filled : for he gave them their
own desire ;

 They were not estranged from their lust . </s>
<s> But while their meat
was yet in their mouths ,

 The wrath of God came upon them , and slew the fattest of them ,
and smote down the chosen men of Israel . </s>
<s> For all this they sinned still , and believed not for his
wondrous works . </s>
<s> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity , and their years
in trouble . </s>
<s> When he slew them , then they sought him : and they returned and
enquired early after God . </s>
<s> And they remembered that God was their rock , and the high God
their redeemer . </s>
<s> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth , and they
lied unto him with their tongues . </s>
<s> For their heart was not right with him , neither were they
stedfast in his covenant . </s>
<s> But he , being full of compassion , forgave their iniquity , and
destroyed them not : yea , many a time turned he his anger away , and did
not stir up all his wrath . </s>
<s> For he remembered that they were but flesh ; a wind that passeth
away , and cometh not again . </s>
<s> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness , and grieve him
in the desert ! </s>
<s> Yea , they turned back and tempted God , and limited the Holy One
of Israel . </s>
<s> They remembered not his hand , nor the day when he delivered them
from the enemy . </s>
<s> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt , and his wonders in the
field of Zoan . </s>
<s> And had turned their rivers into blood ; and their floods , that
they could not drink . </s>
<s> He sent divers sorts of flies among them , which devoured them ;
and frogs , which destroyed them . </s>
<s> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller , and their
labour unto the locust . </s>
<s> He destroyed their vines with hail , and their sycomore trees
with frost . </s>
<s> He gave up their cattle also to the hail , and their flocks to
hot thunderbolts . </s>
<s> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger , wrath , and
indignation , and trouble , by sending evil angels among them . </s>
<s> He made a way to his anger ; he spared not their soul from death ,
but gave their life over to the pestilence ;

 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt ; the chief of their
strength in the tabernacles of Ham :

 But made his own people to go forth like sheep , and guided them
in the wilderness like a flock . </s>
<s> And he led them on safely , so that they feared not : but the sea
overwhelmed their enemies . </s>
<s> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary , even to this
mountain , which his right hand had purchased . </s>
<s> He cast out the heathen also before them , and divided them an
inheritance by line , and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their
tents . </s>
<s> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God , and kept not
his testimonies :

 But turned back , and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers : they
were turned aside like a deceitful bow . </s>
<s> For they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved
him to jealousy with their graven images . </s>
<s> When God heard this , he was wroth , and greatly abhorred Israel :

 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh , the tent which he
placed among men ;

 And delivered his strength into captivity , and his glory into
the enemy 's hand . </s>
<s> He gave his people over also unto the sword ; and was wroth with
his inheritance . </s>
<s> The fire consumed their young men ; and their maidens were not
given to marriage . </s>
<s> Their priests fell by the sword ; and their widows made no
lamentation . </s>
<s> Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep , and like a mighty man
that shouteth by reason of wine . </s>
<s> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts : he put them to a
perpetual reproach . </s>
<s> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph , and chose not the
tribe of Ephraim :

 But chose the tribe of Judah , the mount Zion which he loved . </s>
<s> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces , like the earth
which he hath established for ever . </s>
<s> He chose David also his servant , and took him from the
sheepfolds :

 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed
Jacob his people , and Israel his inheritance . </s>
<s> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart ; and
guided them by the skilfulness of his hands . </s>
<s> O God , the heathen are come into thine inheritance ; thy holy
temple have they defiled ; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps . </s>
<s> The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto
the fowls of the heaven , the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of
the earth . </s>
<s> Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem ; and
there was none to bury them . </s>
<s> We are become a reproach to our neighbours , a scorn and derision
to them that are round about us . </s>
<s> How long , LORD ? </s>
<s> wilt thou be angry for ever ? </s>
<s> shall thy jealousy
burn like fire ? </s>
<s> Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee , and
upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name . </s>
<s> For they have devoured Jacob , and laid waste his dwelling place . </s>
<s> O remember not against us former iniquities : let thy tender
mercies speedily prevent us : for we are brought very low . </s>
<s> Help us , O God of our salvation , for the glory of thy name : and
deliver us , and purge away our sins , for thy name 's sake . </s>
<s> Wherefore should the heathen say , Where is their God ? </s>
<s> let him be
known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of
thy servants which is shed . </s>
<s> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee ; according to
the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to
die ;

 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their
reproach , wherewith they have reproached thee , O Lord . </s>
<s> So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks
for ever : we will shew forth thy praise to all generations . </s>
<s> Give ear , O Shepherd of Israel , thou that leadest Joseph like a
flock ; thou that dwellest between the cherubims , shine forth . </s>
<s> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength ,
and come and save us . </s>
<s> Turn us again , O God , and cause thy face to shine ; and we shall
be saved . </s>
<s> O LORD God of hosts , how long wilt thou be angry against the
prayer of thy people ? </s>
<s> Thou feedest them with the bread of tears ; and givest them tears
to drink in great measure . </s>
<s> Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours : and our enemies
laugh among themselves . </s>
<s> Turn us again , O God of hosts , and cause thy face to shine ; and
we shall be saved . </s>
<s> Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt : thou hast cast out the
heathen , and planted it . </s>
<s> Thou preparedst room before it , and didst cause it to take deep
root , and it filled the land . </s>
<s> The hills were covered with the shadow of it , and the boughs
thereof were like the goodly cedars . </s>
<s> She sent out her boughs unto the sea , and her branches unto the
river . </s>
<s> Why hast thou then broken down her hedges , so that all they
which pass by the way do pluck her ? </s>
<s> The boar out of the wood doth waste it , and the wild beast of
the field doth devour it . </s>
<s> Return , we beseech thee , O God of hosts : look down from heaven ,
and behold , and visit this vine ;

 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted , and the
branch that thou madest strong for thyself . </s>
<s> It is burned with fire , it is cut down : they perish at the
rebuke of thy countenance . </s>
<s> Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand , upon the son of
man whom thou madest strong for thyself . </s>
<s> So will not we go back from thee : quicken us , and we will call
upon thy name . </s>
<s> Turn us again , O LORD God of hosts , cause thy face to shine ; and
we shall be saved . </s>
<s> Sing aloud unto God our strength : make a joyful noise unto the
God of Jacob . </s>
<s> Take a psalm , and bring hither the timbrel , the pleasant harp
with the psaltery . </s>

not . </s>

Egypt : open thy mouth wide , and I will fill it . </s>

<s> Thy wrath lieth hard upon me , and thou hast afflicted me with all

<s> Thou rulest the raging of the sea : when the waves thereof arise ,
thou stillest them . </s>
<s> Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces , as one that is slain ; thou
hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm . </s>
<s> The heavens are thine , the earth also is thine : as for the world
and the fulness thereof , thou hast founded them . </s>
<s> The north and the south thou hast created them : Tabor and Hermon

horn shall be exalted . </s>
<s> For the LORD is our defence ; and the Holy One of Israel is our
king . </s>
<s> Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one , and saidst , I have
laid help upon one that is mighty ; I have exalted one chosen out of
the people . </s>
<s> I have found David my servant ; with my holy oil have I anointed

<s> And I will beat down his foes before his face , and plague them

rivers . </s>
<s> He shall cry unto me , Thou art my father , my God , and the rock

stand fast with him . </s>
<s> His seed also will I make to endure for ever , and his throne as

<s> If his children forsake my law , and walk not in my judgments ;

iniquity with stripes . </s>
<s> Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him ,

<s> My covenant will I not break , nor alter the thing that is gone
out of my lips . </s>

strong holds to ruin . </s>

neighbours . </s>
<s> Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries ; thou hast
made all his enemies to rejoice . </s>
<s> Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword , and hast not made
him to stand in the battle . </s>
<s> Thou hast made his glory to cease , and cast his throne down to
the ground . </s>
<s> The days of his youth hast thou shortened : thou hast covered him
with shame . </s>

<s> Remember , Lord , the reproach of thy servants ; how I do bear in

<s> Amen , and Amen . </s>
<s> Lord , thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations . </s>
<s> Before the mountains were brought forth , or ever thou hadst

<s> In the morning it flourisheth , and groweth up ; in the evening it
is cut down , and withereth . </s>
<s> For we are consumed by thine anger , and by thy wrath are we

<s> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee , our secret sins in the
light of thy countenance . </s>
<s> For all our days are passed away in thy wrath : we spend our years
as a tale that is told . </s>
<s> The days of our years are threescore years and ten ; and if by

labour and sorrow ; for it is soon cut off , and we fly away . </s>
<s> Who knoweth the power of thine anger ? </s>
<s> even according to thy
fear , so is thy wrath . </s>
<s> So teach us to number our days , that we may apply our hearts
unto wisdom . </s>
<s> Return , O LORD , how long ? </s>
<s> and let it repent thee concerning thy

us , and the years wherein we have seen evil . </s>
<s> Let thy work appear unto thy servants , and thy glory unto their

<s> And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us : and establish
thou the work of our hands upon us ; yea , the work of our hands
establish thou it . </s>
<s> He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide

<s> I will say of the LORD , He is my refuge and my fortress : my God ;

<s> Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler , and
from the noisome pestilence . </s>
<s> He shall cover thee with his feathers , and under his wings shalt
thou trust : his truth shall be thy shield and buckler . </s>
<s> Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night ; nor for the
arrow that flieth by day ;

 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness ; nor for the
destruction that wasteth at noonday . </s>
<s> A thousand shall fall at thy side , and ten thousand at thy right
hand ; but it shall not come nigh thee . </s>
<s> Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
wicked . </s>
<s> Because thou hast made the LORD , which is my refuge , even the
most High , thy habitation ;

 There shall no evil befall thee , neither shall any plague come
nigh thy dwelling . </s>
<s> For he shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee in
all thy ways . </s>
<s> They shall bear thee up in their hands , lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone . </s>
<s> Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder : the young lion and the
dragon shalt thou trample under feet . </s>
<s> Because he hath set his love upon me , therefore will I deliver
him : I will set him on high , because he hath known my name . </s>
<s> He shall call upon me , and I will answer him : I will be with him
in trouble ; I will deliver him , and honour him . </s>
<s> With long life will I satisfy him , and shew him my salvation . </s>
<s> IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD , AND TO SING

off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD . </s>

incline thine ear unto me : in the day when I call answer me speedily . </s>
<s> For my days are consumed like smoke , and my bones are burned as

to eat my bread . </s>

<s> Mine enemies reproach me all the day ; and they that are mad
against me are sworn against me . </s>
<s> For I have eaten ashes like bread , and mingled my drink with
weeping . </s>

like grass . </s>

Jerusalem ;

in mercy . </s>
<s> He will not always chide : neither will he keep his anger for

<s> He hath not dealt with us after our sins ; nor rewarded us
according to our iniquities . </s>
<s> For as the heaven is high above the earth , so great is his
mercy toward them that fear him . </s>
<s> As far as the east is from the west , so far hath he removed our
transgressions from us . </s>

1 Who laid the foundations of the earth , that it should not be
removed for ever . </s>
<s> Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment : the waters
stood above the mountains . </s>

away . </s>

the place which thou hast founded for them . </s>
<s> Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over ; that they
turn not again to cover the earth . </s>

hills . </s>
<s> They give drink to every beast of the field : the wild asses
quench their thirst . </s>
<s> By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation ,
which sing among the branches . </s>
<s> He watereth the hills from his chambers : the earth is satisfied
with the fruit of thy works . </s>
<s> He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle , and herb for the
service of man : that he may bring forth food out of the earth ;

face to shine , and bread which strengtheneth man 's heart . </s>
<s> The trees of the LORD are full of sap ; the cedars of Lebanon ,
which he hath planted ;

1 Where the birds make their nests : as for the stork , the fir
trees are her house . </s>
<s> The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats ; and the rocks
for the conies . </s>
<s> He appointed the moon for seasons : the sun knoweth his going
down . </s>
<s> Thou makest darkness , and it is night : wherein all the beasts
of the forest do creep forth . </s>
<s> The young lions roar after their prey , and seek their meat from
God . </s>
<s> The sun ariseth , they gather themselves together , and lay them
down in their dens . </s>
<s> Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
evening . </s>
<s> O LORD , how manifold are thy works ! </s>

innumerable , both small and great beasts . </s>

made to play therein . </s>

in due season . </s>

strangers in it . </s>
<s> When they went from one nation to another , from one kingdom to
another people ;

1 He suffered no man to do them wrong : yea , he reproved kings for
their sakes ;

1 Saying , Touch not mine anointed , and do my prophets no harm . </s>
<s> Moreover he called for a famine upon the land : he brake the
whole staff of bread . </s>
<s> He sent a man before them , even Joseph , who was sold for a
servant :

1 Whose feet they hurt with fetters : he was laid in iron :

1 Until the time that his word came : the word of the LORD tried
him . </s>
<s> The king sent and loosed him ; even the ruler of the people , and
let him go free . </s>
<s> He made him lord of his house , and ruler of all his substance :

1 To bind his princes at his pleasure ; and teach his senators
wisdom . </s>
<s> Israel also came into Egypt ; and Jacob sojourned in the land of
Ham . </s>
<s> And he increased his people greatly ; and made them stronger
than their enemies . </s>
<s> He turned their heart to hate his people , to deal subtilly with
his servants . </s>
<s> He sent Moses his servant ; and Aaron whom he had chosen . </s>
<s> They shewed his signs among them , and wonders in the land of
Ham . </s>
<s> He sent darkness , and made it dark ; and they rebelled not
against his word . </s>
<s> He turned their waters into blood , and slew their fish . </s>
<s> Their land brought forth frogs in abundance , in the chambers of
their kings . </s>
<s> He spake , and there came divers sorts of flies , and lice in all
their coasts . </s>
<s> He gave them hail for rain , and flaming fire in their land . </s>
<s> He smote their vines also and their fig trees ; and brake the
trees of their coasts . </s>
<s> He spake , and the locusts came , and caterpillers , and that
without number ,

1 And did eat up all the herbs in their land , and devoured the
fruit of their ground . </s>
<s> He smote also all the firstborn in their land , the chief of all
their strength . </s>
<s> He brought them forth also with silver and gold : and there was
not one feeble person among their tribes . </s>
<s> Egypt was glad when they departed : for the fear of them fell
upon them . </s>
<s> He spread a cloud for a covering ; and fire to give light in the
night . </s>
<s> The people asked , and he brought quails , and satisfied them
with the bread of heaven . </s>
<s> He opened the rock , and the waters gushed out ; they ran in the
dry places like a river . </s>
<s> For he remembered his holy promise , and Abraham his servant . </s>
<s> And he brought forth his people with joy , and his chosen with
gladness :

1 And gave them the lands of the heathen : and they inherited the

<s> Remember me , O LORD , with the favour that thou bearest unto thy

<s> We have sinned with our fathers , we have committed iniquity , we
have done wickedly . </s>
<s> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt ; they remembered
not the multitude of thy mercies ; but provoked him at the sea , even at
the Red sea . </s>
<s> Nevertheless he saved them for his name 's sake , that he might
make his mighty power to be known . </s>
<s> He rebuked the Red sea also , and it was dried up : so he led them
through the depths , as through the wilderness . </s>
<s> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them , and
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy . </s>
<s> And the waters covered their enemies : there was not one of them
left . </s>
<s> Then believed they his words ; they sang his praise . </s>
<s> They soon forgat his works ; they waited not for his counsel :

1 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness , and tempted God in
the desert . </s>
<s> And he gave them their request ; but sent leanness into their
soul . </s>
<s> They envied Moses also in the camp , and Aaron the saint of the
LORD . </s>
<s> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
company of Abiram . </s>
<s> And a fire was kindled in their company ; the flame burned up
the wicked . </s>
<s> They made a calf in Horeb , and worshipped the molten image . </s>
<s> Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that
eateth grass . </s>
<s> They forgat God their saviour , which had done great things in
Egypt ;

1 Wondrous works in the land of Ham , and terrible things by the
Red sea . </s>
<s> Therefore he said that he would destroy them , had not Moses his
chosen stood before him in the breach , to turn away his wrath , lest he
should destroy them . </s>
<s> Yea , they despised the pleasant land , they believed not his
word :

1 But murmured in their tents , and hearkened not unto the voice
of the LORD . </s>
<s> Therefore he lifted up his hand against them , to overthrow them
in the wilderness :

1 To overthrow their seed also among the nations , and to scatter
them in the lands . </s>
<s> They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor , and ate the
sacrifices of the dead . </s>
<s> Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions : and the
plague brake in upon them . </s>
<s> Then stood up Phinehas , and executed judgment : and so the
plague was stayed . </s>
<s> And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
generations for evermore . </s>
<s> They angered him also at the waters of strife , so that it went
ill with Moses for their sakes :

1 Because they provoked his spirit , so that he spake unadvisedly
with his lips . </s>
<s> They did not destroy the nations , concerning whom the LORD
commanded them :

1 But were mingled among the heathen , and learned their works . </s>
<s> And they served their idols : which were a snare unto them . </s>
<s> Yea , they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
devils ,

1 And shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of
their daughters , whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan : and
the land was polluted with blood . </s>
<s> Thus were they defiled with their own works , and went a whoring
with their own inventions . </s>
<s> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people ,
insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance . </s>
<s> And he gave them into the hand of the heathen ; and they that
hated them ruled over them . </s>
<s> Their enemies also oppressed them , and they were brought into
subjection under their hand . </s>
<s> Many times did he deliver them ; but they provoked him with
their counsel , and were brought low for their iniquity . </s>
<s> Nevertheless he regarded their affliction , when he heard their
cry :

1 And he remembered for them his covenant , and repented according
to the multitude of his mercies . </s>
<s> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
captives . </s>
<s> Save us , O LORD our God , and gather us from among the heathen ,
to give thanks unto thy holy name , and to triumph in thy praise . </s>
<s> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
everlasting : and let all the people say , Amen . </s>
<s> Praise ye the LORD . </s>
<s> O give thanks unto the LORD , for he is good : for his mercy
endureth for ever . </s>
<s> Let the redeemed of the LORD say so , whom he hath redeemed from
the hand of the enemy ;

1 And gathered them out of the lands , from the east , and from the
west , from the north , and from the south . </s>
<s> They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way ; they found no
city to dwell in . </s>
<s> Hungry and thirsty , their soul fainted in them . </s>
<s> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble , and he delivered
them out of their distresses . </s>
<s> And he led them forth by the right way , that they might go to a
city of habitation . </s>
<s> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness , and for his
wonderful works to the children of men ! </s>
<s> For he satisfieth the longing soul , and filleth the hungry soul
with goodness . </s>
<s> Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , being bound
in affliction and iron ;

1 Because they rebelled against the words of God , and contemned
the counsel of the most High :

1 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour ; they fell
down , and there was none to help . </s>
<s> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble , and he saved
them out of their distresses . </s>
<s> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death , and
brake their bands in sunder . </s>
<s> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness , and for his
wonderful works to the children of men ! </s>
<s> For he hath broken the gates of brass , and cut the bars of iron
in sunder . </s>
<s> Fools because of their transgression , and because of their
iniquities , are afflicted . </s>
<s> Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat ; and they draw near
unto the gates of death . </s>
<s> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble , and he saveth
them out of their distresses . </s>
<s> He sent his word , and healed them , and delivered them from
their destructions . </s>
<s> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness , and for his
wonderful works to the children of men ! </s>
<s> And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving , and
declare his works with rejoicing . </s>
<s> They that go down to the sea in ships , that do business in
great waters ;

1 These see the works of the LORD , and his wonders in the deep . </s>
<s> For he commandeth , and raiseth the stormy wind , which lifteth
up the waves thereof . </s>
<s> They mount up to the heaven , they go down again to the depths :
their soul is melted because of trouble . </s>
<s> They reel to and fro , and stagger like a drunken man , and are
at their wit 's end . </s>
<s> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble , and he bringeth
them out of their distresses . </s>
<s> He maketh the storm a calm , so that the waves thereof are
still . </s>
<s> Then are they glad because they be quiet ; so he bringeth them
unto their desired haven . </s>
<s> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness , and for his
wonderful works to the children of men ! </s>
<s> Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people , and
praise him in the assembly of the elders . </s>
<s> He turneth rivers into a wilderness , and the watersprings into
dry ground ;

1 A fruitful land into barrenness , for the wickedness of them
that dwell therein . </s>
<s> He turneth the wilderness into a standing water , and dry ground
into watersprings . </s>
<s> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell , that they may prepare
a city for habitation ;

1 And sow the fields , and plant vineyards , which may yield fruits
of increase . </s>
<s> He blesseth them also , so that they are multiplied greatly ; and
suffereth not their cattle to decrease . </s>
<s> Again , they are minished and brought low through oppression ,
affliction , and sorrow . </s>
<s> He poureth contempt upon princes , and causeth them to wander in
the wilderness , where there is no way . </s>
<s> Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction , and maketh him
families like a flock . </s>
<s> The righteous shall see it , and rejoice : and all iniquity shall
stop her mouth . </s>
<s> Whoso is wise , and will observe these things , even they shall

1 :1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David , king of Israel ; 1 :2 To
know wisdom and instruction ; to perceive the words of understanding ;
1 :3 To receive the instruction of wisdom , justice , and judgment , and
equity ; 1 :4 To give subtilty to the simple , to the young man knowledge
and discretion . </s>
<s> A wise man will hear , and will increase learning ; and a man of
understanding shall attain unto wise counsels : 1 :6 To understand a
proverb , and the interpretation ; the words of the wise , and their dark
sayings . </s>
<s> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge : but fools
despise wisdom and instruction . </s>
<s> My son , hear the instruction of thy father , and forsake not the
law of thy mother : 1 :9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy
head , and chains about thy neck . </s>
<s> My son , if sinners entice thee , consent thou not . </s>
<s> If they say , Come with us , let us lay wait for blood , let us lurk
privily for the innocent without cause : Let us swallow them up
alive as the grave ; and whole , as those that go down into the pit :
 We shall find all precious substance , we shall fill our houses
with spoil : Cast in thy lot among us ; let us all have one purse :
 My son , walk not thou in the way with them ; refrain thy foot from
their path : For their feet run to evil , and make haste to shed
blood . </s>
<s> Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird . </s>
<s> And they lay wait for their own blood ; they lurk privily for
their own lives . </s>
<s> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain ; which taketh
away the life of the owners thereof . </s>
<s> Wisdom crieth without ; she uttereth her voice in the streets :
 She crieth in the chief place of concourse , in the openings of
the gates : in the city she uttereth her words , saying , How long ,
ye simple ones , will ye love simplicity ? </s>
<s> and the scorners delight in
their scorning , and fools hate knowledge ? </s>
<s>  Turn you at my
reproof : behold , I will pour out my spirit unto you , I will make known
my words unto you . </s>
<s> Because I have called , and ye refused ; I have stretched out my
hand , and no man regarded ; But ye have set at nought all my
counsel , and would none of my reproof : I also will laugh at your
calamity ; I will mock when your fear cometh ; When your fear
cometh as desolation , and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind ; when
distress and anguish cometh upon you . </s>
<s> Then shall they call upon me , but I will not answer ; they shall
seek me early , but they shall not find me : For that they hated
knowledge , and did not choose the fear of the LORD : They would
none of my counsel : they despised all my reproof . </s>
<s> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way , and be
filled with their own devices . </s>
<s> For the turning away of the simple shall slay them , and the
prosperity of fools shall destroy them . </s>
<s> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely , and shall be
quiet from fear of evil . </s>
<s> My son , if thou wilt receive my words , and hide my commandments
with thee ; 2 :2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom , and apply
thine heart to understanding ; 2 :3 Yea , if thou criest after knowledge ,
and liftest up thy voice for understanding ; 2 :4 If thou seekest her as
silver , and searchest for her as for hid treasures ; 2 :5 Then shalt
thou understand the fear of the LORD , and find the knowledge of God . </s>
<s> For the LORD giveth wisdom : out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
understanding . </s>
<s> He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous : he is a buckler to
them that walk uprightly . </s>
<s> He keepeth the paths of judgment , and preserveth the way of his
saints . </s>
<s> Then shalt thou understand righteousness , and judgment , and
equity ; yea , every good path . </s>
<s> When wisdom entereth into thine heart , and knowledge is pleasant
unto thy soul ; Discretion shall preserve thee , understanding
shall keep thee : To deliver thee from the way of the evil man ,
from the man that speaketh froward things ; Who leave the paths of
uprightness , to walk in the ways of darkness ; Who rejoice to do
evil , and delight in the frowardness of the wicked ; Whose ways
are crooked , and they froward in their paths : To deliver thee
from the strange woman , even from the stranger which flattereth with
her words ; Which forsaketh the guide of her youth , and forgetteth
the covenant of her God . </s>
<s> For her house inclineth unto death , and her paths unto the dead . </s>
<s> None that go unto her return again , neither take they hold of the
paths of life . </s>
<s> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men , and keep the paths
of the righteous . </s>
<s> For the upright shall dwell in the land , and the perfect shall
remain in it . </s>
<s> But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth , and the
transgressors shall be rooted out of it . </s>
<s> My son , forget not my law ; but let thine heart keep my
commandments : 3 :2 For length of days , and long life , and peace , shall

LORD trieth the hearts . </s>

a naughty tongue . </s>

children are their fathers . </s>
<s> Excellent speech becometh not a fool : much less do lying lips a
prince . </s>
<s> A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it :
whithersoever it turneth , it prospereth . </s>
<s> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love ; but he that
repeateth a matter separateth very friends . </s>
<s> A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes

<s> An evil man seeketh only rebellion : therefore a cruel messenger
shall be sent against him . </s>
<s> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man , rather than a fool

house . </s>

therefore leave off contention , before it be meddled with . </s>
<s> He that justifieth the wicked , and he that condemneth the just ,
even they both are abomination to the LORD . </s>
<s> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom ,
seeing he hath no heart to it ? </s>
<s>  A friend loveth at all times ,
and a brother is born for adversity . </s>
<s> A man void of understanding striketh hands , and becometh surety
in the presence of his friend . </s>
<s> He loveth transgression that loveth strife : and he that exalteth
his gate seeketh destruction . </s>
<s> He that hath a froward heart findeth no good : and he that hath a
perverse tongue falleth into mischief . </s>
<s> He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow : and the father
of a fool hath no joy . </s>
<s> A merry heart doeth good like a medicine : but a broken spirit
drieth the bones . </s>
<s> A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways
of judgment . </s>
<s> Wisdom is before him that hath understanding ; but the eyes of a
fool are in the ends of the earth . </s>
<s> A foolish son is a grief to his father , and bitterness to her
that bare him . </s>
<s> Also to punish the just is not good , nor to strike princes for
equity . </s>
<s> He that hath knowledge spareth his words : and a man of
understanding is of an excellent spirit . </s>
<s> Even a fool , when he holdeth his peace , is counted wise : and he
that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding . </s>
<s> Through desire a man , having separated himself , seeketh and
intermeddleth with all wisdom . </s>
<s> A fool hath no delight in understanding , but that his heart may
discover itself . </s>
<s> When the wicked cometh , then cometh also contempt , and with
ignominy reproach . </s>
<s> The words of a man 's mouth are as deep waters , and the wellspring
of wisdom as a flowing brook . </s>
<s> It is not good to accept the person of the wicked , to overthrow
the righteous in judgment . </s>
<s> A fool 's lips enter into contention , and his mouth calleth for
strokes . </s>
<s> A fool 's mouth is his destruction , and his lips are the snare of
his soul . </s>
<s> The words of a talebearer are as wounds , and they go down into
the innermost parts of the belly . </s>
<s> He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a
great waster . </s>
<s> The name of the LORD is a strong tower : the righteous runneth
into it , and is safe . </s>
<s> The rich man 's wealth is his strong city , and as an high wall in
his own conceit . </s>
<s> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty , and before
honour is humility . </s>
<s> He that answereth a matter before he heareth it , it is folly and
shame unto him . </s>
<s> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity ; but a wounded
spirit who can bear ? </s>
<s>  The heart of the prudent getteth
knowledge ; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge . </s>
<s> A man 's gift maketh room for him , and bringeth him before great
men . </s>
<s> He that is first in his own cause seemeth just ; but his
neighbour cometh and searcheth him . </s>
<s> The lot causeth contentions to cease , and parteth between the
mighty . </s>
<s> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city : and
their contentions are like the bars of a castle . </s>
<s> A man 's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth ;
and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled . </s>
<s> Death and life are in the power of the tongue : and they that
love it shall eat the fruit thereof . </s>
<s> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing , and obtaineth favour
of the LORD . </s>
<s> The poor useth intreaties ; but the rich answereth roughly . </s>
<s> A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly : and there is
a friend that sticketh closer than a brother . </s>
<s> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity , than he that is
perverse in his lips , and is a fool . </s>
<s> Also , that the soul be without knowledge , it is not good ; and he
that hasteth with his feet sinneth . </s>
<s> The foolishness of man perverteth his way : and his heart fretteth
against the LORD . </s>
<s> Wealth maketh many friends ; but the poor is separated from his
neighbour . </s>
<s> A false witness shall not be unpunished , and he that speaketh
lies shall not escape . </s>
<s> Many will intreat the favour of the prince : and every man is a
friend to him that giveth gifts . </s>
<s> All the brethren of the poor do hate him : how much more do his
friends go far from him ? </s>
<s> he pursueth them with words , yet they are
wanting to him . </s>
<s> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul : he that keepeth
understanding shall find good . </s>
<s> A false witness shall not be unpunished , and he that speaketh
lies shall perish . </s>
<s> Delight is not seemly for a fool ; much less for a servant to
have rule over princes . </s>
<s> The discretion of a man deferreth his anger ; and it is his glory
to pass over a transgression . </s>
<s> The king 's wrath is as the roaring of a lion ; but his favour is
as dew upon the grass . </s>
<s> A foolish son is the calamity of his father : and the contentions
of a wife are a continual dropping . </s>
<s> House and riches are the inheritance of fathers : and a prudent
wife is from the LORD . </s>
<s> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep ; and an idle soul shall
suffer hunger . </s>
<s> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul ; but he
that despiseth his ways shall die . </s>
<s> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD ; and that
which he hath given will he pay him again . </s>
<s> Chasten thy son while there is hope , and let not thy soul spare
for his crying . </s>
<s> A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment : for if thou
deliver him , yet thou must do it again . </s>
<s> Hear counsel , and receive instruction , that thou mayest be wise
in thy latter end . </s>
<s> There are many devices in a man 's heart ; nevertheless the
counsel of the LORD , that shall stand . </s>
<s> The desire of a man is his kindness : and a poor man is better
than a liar . </s>
<s> The fear of the LORD tendeth to life : and he that hath it shall
abide satisfied ; he shall not be visited with evil . </s>
<s> A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom , and will not so
much as bring it to his mouth again . </s>
<s> Smite a scorner , and the simple will beware : and reprove one
that hath understanding , and he will understand knowledge . </s>
<s> He that wasteth his father , and chaseth away his mother , is a
son that causeth shame , and bringeth reproach . </s>
<s> Cease , my son , to hear the instruction that causeth to err from
the words of knowledge . </s>
<s> An ungodly witness scorneth judgment : and the mouth of the
wicked devoureth iniquity . </s>
<s> Judgments are prepared for scorners , and stripes for the back of
fools . </s>
<s> Wine is a mocker , strong drink is raging : and whosoever is
deceived thereby is not wise . </s>
<s> The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion : whoso provoketh
him to anger sinneth against his own soul . </s>
<s> It is an honour for a man to cease from strife : but every fool
will be meddling . </s>
<s> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold ; therefore shall
he beg in harvest , and have nothing . </s>
<s> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water ; but a man of
understanding will draw it out . </s>
<s> Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness : but a faithful
man who can find ? </s>
<s>  The just man walketh in his integrity : his
children are blessed after him . </s>
<s> A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all
evil with his eyes . </s>
<s> Who can say , I have made my heart clean , I am pure from my sin ? </s>
<s> Divers weights , and divers measures , both of them are alike
abomination to the LORD . </s>
<s> Even a child is known by his doings , whether his work be pure ,
and whether it be right . </s>
<s> The hearing ear , and the seeing eye , the LORD hath made even
both of them . </s>
<s> Love not sleep , lest thou come to poverty ; open thine eyes , and
thou shalt be satisfied with bread . </s>
<s> It is naught , it is naught , saith the buyer : but when he is gone
his way , then he boasteth . </s>
<s> There is gold , and a multitude of rubies : but the lips of
knowledge are a precious jewel . </s>
<s> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger : and take a
pledge of him for a strange woman . </s>
<s> Bread of deceit is sweet to a man ; but afterwards his mouth
shall be filled with gravel . </s>
<s> Every purpose is established by counsel : and with good advice
make war . </s>
<s> He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets : therefore
meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips . </s>
<s> Whoso curseth his father or his mother , his lamp shall be put
out in obscure darkness . </s>
<s> An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning ; but the
end thereof shall not be blessed . </s>
<s> Say not thou , I will recompense evil ; but wait on the LORD , and
he shall save thee . </s>
<s> Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD ; and a false
balance is not good . </s>
<s> Man 's goings are of the LORD ; how can a man then understand his
own way ? </s>
<s>  It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is
holy , and after vows to make enquiry . </s>
<s> A wise king scattereth the wicked , and bringeth the wheel over
them . </s>
<s> The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD , searching all the
inward parts of the belly . </s>
<s> Mercy and truth preserve the king : and his throne is upholden by
mercy . </s>
<s> The glory of young men is their strength : and the beauty of old
men is the grey head . </s>
<s> The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil : so do stripes the
inward parts of the belly . </s>
<s> The king 's heart is in the hand of the LORD , as the rivers of
water : he turneth it whithersoever he will . </s>
<s> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes : but the LORD
pondereth the hearts . </s>
<s> To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than
sacrifice . </s>
<s> An high look , and a proud heart , and the plowing of the wicked ,
is sin . </s>
<s> The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness ; but of
every one that is hasty only to want . </s>
<s> The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to
and fro of them that seek death . </s>
<s> The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them ; because they refuse
to do judgment . </s>
<s> The way of man is froward and strange : but as for the pure , his
work is right . </s>
<s> It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop , than with a
brawling woman in a wide house . </s>
<s> The soul of the wicked desireth evil : his neighbour findeth no
favour in his eyes . </s>
<s> When the scorner is punished , the simple is made wise : and when
the wise is instructed , he receiveth knowledge . </s>
<s> The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked :
but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness . </s>
<s> Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor , he also shall
cry himself , but shall not be heard . </s>
<s> A gift in secret pacifieth anger : and a reward in the bosom
strong wrath . </s>
<s> It is joy to the just to do judgment : but destruction shall be
to the workers of iniquity . </s>
<s> The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall
remain in the congregation of the dead . </s>
<s> He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man : he that loveth wine
and oil shall not be rich . </s>
<s> The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous , and the
transgressor for the upright . </s>
<s> It is better to dwell in the wilderness , than with a contentious
and an angry woman . </s>
<s> There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the
wise ; but a foolish man spendeth it up . </s>
<s> He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life ,
righteousness , and honour . </s>
<s> A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty , and casteth down the
strength of the confidence thereof . </s>

troubles . </s>

wrath . </s>

labour . </s>

and spareth not . </s>
<s> The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination : how much more , when
he bringeth it with a wicked mind ? </s>
<s>  A false witness shall
perish : but the man that heareth speaketh constantly . </s>

directeth his way . </s>
<s> There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the
LORD . </s>

of the LORD . </s>
<s> A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches , and loving
favour rather than silver and gold . </s>
<s> The rich and poor meet together : the LORD is the maker of them
all . </s>

simple pass on , and are punished . </s>

life . </s>

keep his soul shall be far from them . </s>

lender . </s>

anger shall fail . </s>

his bread to the poor . </s>

and reproach shall cease . </s>

king shall be his friend . </s>

words of the transgressor . </s>

slain in the streets . </s>

correction shall drive it far from him . </s>

knowledge , That I might make thee know the certainty of the
words of truth ; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them

thou shalt not go : Lest thou learn his ways , and get a snare to
thy soul . </s>

sureties for debts . </s>

fathers have set . </s>

thy sweet words . </s>

the fatherless : For their redeemer is mighty ; he shall plead
their cause with thee . </s>

LORD all the day long . </s>

cut off . </s>
<s> Hear thou , my son , and be wise , and guide thine heart in the
way . </s>
<s> Be not among winebibbers ; among riotous eaters of flesh : 
For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty : and drowsiness
shall clothe a man with rags . </s>
<s> Hearken unto thy father that begat thee , and despise not thy
mother when she is old . </s>

pit . </s>

colour in the cup , when it moveth itself aright . </s>

adder . </s>

utter perverse things . </s>
<s> Yea , thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the
sea , or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast . </s>
<s> They have stricken me , shalt thou say , and I was not sick ; they
have beaten me , and I felt it not : when shall I awake ? </s>

yet again . </s>
<s> Be not thou envious against evil men , neither desire to be with
them . </s>

mischief . </s>
<s> Through wisdom is an house builded ; and by understanding it is
established : And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with
all precious and pleasant riches . </s>

strength . </s>
<s> For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war : and in multitude of
counsellors there is safety . </s>
<s> Wisdom is too high for a fool : he openeth not his mouth in the
gate . </s>
<s> He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person . </s>
<s> The thought of foolishness is sin : and the scorner is an
abomination to men . </s>
<s> If thou faint in the day of adversity , thy strength is small . </s>

those that are ready to be slain ; If thou sayest , Behold , we

every man according to his works ? </s>
<s>  My son , eat thou honey ,

them that are given to change : For their calamity shall rise
suddenly ; and who knoweth the ruin of them both ? </s>

also belong to the wise . </s>
<s> It is not good to have respect of persons in
judgment . </s>

man void of understanding ; And , lo , it was all grown over with
thorns , and nettles had covered the face thereof , and the stone wall
thereof was broken down . </s>

received instruction . </s>

hands to sleep : So shall thy poverty come as one that
travelleth ; and thy want as an armed man . </s>

king of Judah copied out . </s>

thee , Come up hither ; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the
presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen . </s>

the end thereof , when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame . </s>

of thee , and so hate thee . </s>

maul , and a sword , and a sharp arrow . </s>

broken tooth , and a foot out of joint . </s>

upon nitre , so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart . </s>

thirsty , give him water to drink : For thou shalt heap coals of
fire upon his head , and the LORD shall reward thee . </s>

talebearer , the strife ceaseth . </s>
<s> As coals are to burning coals , and wood to fire ; so is a
contentious man to kindle strife . </s>
<s> The words of a talebearer are as wounds , and they go down into
the innermost parts of the belly . </s>
<s> Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with
silver dross . </s>
<s> He that hateth dissembleth with his lips , and layeth up deceit
within him ; When he speaketh fair , believe him not : for there
are seven abominations in his heart . </s>
<s> Whose hatred is covered by deceit , his wickedness shall be
shewed before the whole congregation . </s>
<s> Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein : and he that rolleth a
stone , it will return upon him . </s>
<s> A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it ; and a
flattering mouth worketh ruin . </s>
<s> Boast not thyself of to morrow ; for thou knowest not what a day
may bring forth . </s>
<s> Let another man praise thee , and not thine own mouth ; a stranger ,
and not thine own lips . </s>
<s> A stone is heavy , and the sand weighty ; but a fool 's wrath is
heavier than them both . </s>
<s> Wrath is cruel , and anger is outrageous ; but who is able to stand
before envy ? </s>
<s>  Open rebuke is better than secret love . </s>
<s> Faithful are the wounds of a friend ; but the kisses of an enemy
are deceitful . </s>
<s> The full soul loatheth an honeycomb ; but to the hungry soul every
bitter thing is sweet . </s>
<s> As a bird that wandereth from her nest , so is a man that
wandereth from his place . </s>
<s> Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart : so doth the sweetness of
a man 's friend by hearty counsel . </s>
<s> Thine own friend , and thy father 's friend , forsake not ; neither
go into thy brother 's house in the day of thy calamity : for better is
a neighbour that is near than a brother far off . </s>
<s> My son , be wise , and make my heart glad , that I may answer him
that reproacheth me . </s>
<s> A prudent man foreseeth the evil , and hideth himself ; but the
simple pass on , and are punished . </s>
<s> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger , and take a
pledge of him for a strange woman . </s>
<s> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice , rising early in
the morning , it shall be counted a curse to him . </s>
<s> A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman
are alike . </s>
<s> Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind , and the ointment of his
right hand , which bewrayeth itself . </s>
<s> Iron sharpeneth iron ; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his
friend . </s>
<s> Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof : so he
that waiteth on his master shall be honoured . </s>
<s> As in water face answereth to face , so the heart of man to man . </s>
<s> Hell and destruction are never full ; so the eyes of man are
never satisfied . </s>
<s> As the fining pot for silver , and the furnace for gold ; so is a
man to his praise . </s>
<s> Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a
pestle , yet will not his foolishness depart from him . </s>
<s> Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks , and look well
to thy herds . </s>
<s> For riches are not for ever : and doth the crown endure to every
generation ? </s>
<s>  The hay appeareth , and the tender grass sheweth
itself , and herbs of the mountains are gathered . </s>
<s> The lambs are for thy clothing , and the goats are the price of
the field . </s>
<s> And thou shalt have goats ' milk enough for thy food , for the
food of thy household , and for the maintenance for thy maidens . </s>
<s> The wicked flee when no man pursueth : but the righteous are bold
as a lion . </s>
<s> For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof : but
by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be
prolonged . </s>
<s> A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which
leaveth no food . </s>
<s> They that forsake the law praise the wicked : but such as keep the
law contend with them . </s>
<s> Evil men understand not judgment : but they that seek the LORD
understand all things . </s>
<s> Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness , than he that
is perverse in his ways , though he be rich . </s>
<s> Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son : but he that is a companion
of riotous men shameth his father . </s>
<s> He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance , he
shall gather it for him that will pity the poor . </s>
<s> He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law , even his
prayer shall be abomination . </s>
<s> Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way , he
shall fall himself into his own pit : but the upright shall have good
things in possession . </s>
<s> The rich man is wise in his own conceit ; but the poor that hath
understanding searcheth him out . </s>
<s> When righteous men do rejoice , there is great glory : but when
the wicked rise , a man is hidden . </s>
<s> He that covereth his sins shall not prosper : but whoso
confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy . </s>
<s> Happy is the man that feareth alway : but he that hardeneth his
heart shall fall into mischief . </s>
<s> As a roaring lion , and a ranging bear ; so is a wicked ruler over
the poor people . </s>
<s> The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor :
but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days . </s>
<s> A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee
to the pit ; let no man stay him . </s>
<s> Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved : but he that is perverse
in his ways shall fall at once . </s>
<s> He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread : but he that
followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough . </s>
<s> A faithful man shall abound with blessings : but he that maketh
haste to be rich shall not be innocent . </s>
<s> To have respect of persons is not good : for for a piece of bread
that man will transgress . </s>
<s> He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye , and considereth not
that poverty shall come upon him . </s>
<s> He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he
that flattereth with the tongue . </s>
<s> Whoso robbeth his father or his mother , and saith , It is no
transgression ; the same is the companion of a destroyer . </s>
<s> He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife : but he that
putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat . </s>
<s> He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool : but whoso walketh
wisely , he shall be delivered . </s>
<s> He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack : but he that hideth
his eyes shall have many a curse . </s>
<s> When the wicked rise , men hide themselves : but when they perish ,
the righteous increase . </s>
<s> He , that being often reproved hardeneth his neck , shall suddenly
be destroyed , and that without remedy . </s>
<s> When the righteous are in authority , the people rejoice : but when
the wicked beareth rule , the people mourn . </s>
<s> Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father : but he that keepeth
company with harlots spendeth his substance . </s>
<s> The king by judgment establisheth the land : but he that receiveth
gifts overthroweth it . </s>
<s> A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet . </s>
<s> In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare : but the
righteous doth sing and rejoice . </s>
<s> The righteous considereth the cause of the poor : but the wicked
regardeth not to know it . </s>
<s> Scornful men bring a city into a snare : but wise men turn away
wrath . </s>
<s> If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man , whether he rage or
laugh , there is no rest . </s>
<s> The bloodthirsty hate the upright : but the just seek his soul . </s>
<s> A fool uttereth all his mind : but a wise man keepeth it in till
afterwards . </s>
<s> If a ruler hearken to lies , all his servants are wicked . </s>
<s> The poor and the deceitful man meet together : the LORD
lighteneth both their eyes . </s>
<s> The king that faithfully judgeth the poor , his throne shall be
established for ever . </s>
<s> The rod and reproof give wisdom : but a child left to himself
bringeth his mother to shame . </s>
<s> When the wicked are multiplied , transgression increaseth : but
the righteous shall see their fall . </s>
<s> Correct thy son , and he shall give thee rest ; yea , he shall give
delight unto thy soul . </s>
<s> Where there is no vision , the people perish : but he that keepeth
the law , happy is he . </s>
<s> A servant will not be corrected by words : for though he
understand he will not answer . </s>
<s> Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words ? </s>
<s> there is more hope
of a fool than of him . </s>
<s> He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall
have him become his son at the length . </s>
<s> An angry man stirreth up strife , and a furious man aboundeth in
transgression . </s>
<s> A man 's pride shall bring him low : but honour shall uphold the
humble in spirit . </s>
<s> Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul : he heareth
cursing , and bewrayeth it not . </s>
<s> The fear of man bringeth a snare : but whoso putteth his trust in
the LORD shall be safe . </s>
<s> Many seek the ruler 's favour ; but every man 's judgment cometh
from the LORD . </s>
<s> An unjust man is an abomination to the just : and he that is
upright in the way is abomination to the wicked . </s>
<s> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh , even the prophecy : the man
spake unto Ithiel , even unto Ithiel and Ucal , Surely I am more
brutish than any man , and have not the understanding of a man . </s>

<s>  Every word of God is
pure : he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him . </s>
<s> Add thou not unto his words , lest he reprove thee , and thou be
found a liar . </s>
<s> Two things have I required of thee ; deny me them not before I
die : Remove far from me vanity and lies : give me neither poverty
nor riches ; feed me with food convenient for me : Lest I be full ,
and deny thee , and say , Who is the LORD ? </s>
<s> or lest I be poor , and steal ,
and take the name of my God in vain . </s>
<s> Accuse not a servant unto his master , lest he curse thee , and
thou be found guilty . </s>
<s> There is a generation that curseth their father , and doth not
bless their mother . </s>
<s> There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes , and yet
is not washed from their filthiness . </s>

eyelids are lifted up . </s>
<s> There is a generation , whose teeth are as swords , and their jaw
teeth as knives , to devour the poor from off the earth , and the needy
from among men . </s>
<s> The horseleach hath two daughters , crying , Give , give . </s>
<s> There are
three things that are never satisfied , yea , four things say not , It is
enough : The grave ; and the barren womb ; the earth that is not
filled with water ; and the fire that saith not , It is enough . </s>
<s> The eye that mocketh at his father , and despiseth to obey his
mother , the ravens of the valley shall pick it out , and the young
eagles shall eat it . </s>
<s> There be three things which are too wonderful for me , yea , four
which I know not : The way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a
serpent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and
the way of a man with a maid . </s>
<s> Such is the way of an adulterous woman ; she eateth , and wipeth
her mouth , and saith , I have done no wickedness . </s>
<s> For three things the earth is disquieted , and for four which it
cannot bear : For a servant when he reigneth ; and a fool when he
is filled with meat ; For an odious woman when she is married ;
and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress . </s>
<s> There be four things which are little upon the earth , but they
are exceeding wise : The ants are a people not strong , yet they
prepare their meat in the summer ; The conies are but a feeble
folk , yet make they their houses in the rocks ; The locusts have
no king , yet go they forth all of them by bands ; The spider
taketh hold with her hands , and is in kings ' palaces . </s>
<s> There be three things which go well , yea , four are comely in
going : A lion which is strongest among beasts , and turneth not
away for any ; A greyhound ; an he goat also ; and a king , against
whom there is no rising up . </s>
<s> If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself , or if thou
hast thought evil , lay thine hand upon thy mouth . </s>
<s> Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter , and the
wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood : so the forcing of wrath
bringeth forth strife . </s>

him . </s>
<s> What , my son ? </s>
<s> and what , the son of my womb ? </s>
<s> and what , the son of
my vows ? </s>

law , and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted . </s>

those that be of heavy hearts . </s>

poor and needy . </s>

1 :1 The words of the Preacher , the son of David , king in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> Vanity of vanities , saith the Preacher , vanity of vanities ; all is
vanity . </s>
<s> What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the
sun ? </s>
<s> 1 :4 One generation passeth away , and another generation cometh :
but the earth abideth for ever . </s>
<s> The sun also ariseth , and the sun goeth down , and hasteth to his
place where he arose . </s>
<s> The wind goeth toward the south , and turneth about unto the north ;
it whirleth about continually , and the wind returneth again according
to his circuits . </s>
<s> All the rivers run into the sea ; yet the sea is not full ; unto the
place from whence the rivers come , thither they return again . </s>
<s> All things are full of labour ; man cannot utter it : the eye is not
satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing . </s>
<s> The thing that hath been , it is that which shall be ; and that
which is done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing
under the sun . </s>
<s> Is there any thing whereof it may be said , See , this is new ? </s>
<s> it
hath been already of old time , which was before us . </s>
<s> There is no remembrance of former things ; neither shall there be
any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come
after . </s>
<s> I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning
all things that are done under heaven : this sore travail hath God
given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith . </s>
<s> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and ,
behold , all is vanity and vexation of spirit . </s>
<s> That which is crooked cannot be made straight : and that which is
wanting cannot be numbered . </s>
<s> I communed with mine own heart , saying , Lo , I am come to great
estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been
before me in Jerusalem : yea , my heart had great experience of wisdom
and knowledge . </s>
<s> And I gave my heart to know wisdom , and to know madness and
folly : I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit . </s>
<s> For in much wisdom is much grief : and he that increaseth
knowledge increaseth sorrow . </s>
<s> I said in mine heart , Go to now , I will prove thee with mirth ,
therefore enjoy pleasure : and , behold , this also is vanity . </s>
<s> I said of laughter , It is mad : and of mirth , What doeth it ? </s>
<s> 2 :3 I
sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine , yet acquainting mine
heart with wisdom ; and to lay hold on folly , till I might see what was
that good for the sons of men , which they should do under the heaven
all the days of their life . </s>
<s> I made me great works ; I builded me houses ; I planted me
vineyards : 2 :5 I made me gardens and orchards , and I planted trees in
them of all kind of fruits : 2 :6 I made me pools of water , to water
therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees : 2 :7 I got me servants
and maidens , and had servants born in my house ; also I had great
possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem
before me : 2 :8 I gathered me also silver and gold , and the peculiar
treasure of kings and of the provinces : I gat me men singers and women
singers , and the delights of the sons of men , as musical instruments ,
and that of all sorts . </s>
<s> So I was great , and increased more than all that were before me in
Jerusalem : also my wisdom remained with me . </s>
<s> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them , I withheld
not my heart from any joy ; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour : and
this was my portion of all my labour . </s>
<s> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought , and on
the labour that I had laboured to do : and , behold , all was vanity and
vexation of spirit , and there was no profit under the sun . </s>
<s> And I turned myself to behold wisdom , and madness , and folly : for
what can the man do that cometh after the king ? </s>
<s> even that which hath
been already done . </s>
<s> Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly , as far as light excelleth
darkness . </s>
<s> The wise man 's eyes are in his head ; but the fool walketh in
darkness : and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them
all . </s>
<s> Then said I in my heart , As it happeneth to the fool , so it
happeneth even to me ; and why was I then more wise ? </s>
<s> Then I said in my

the sun is grievous unto me : for all is vanity and vexation of spirit . </s>

because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me . </s>
<s> And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool ? </s>

shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured , and
wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun . </s>
<s> This is also vanity . </s>
<s> Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
labour which I took under the sun . </s>
<s> For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom , and in knowledge ,
and in equity ; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he
leave it for his portion . </s>
<s> This also is vanity and a great evil . </s>
<s> For what hath man of all his labour , and of the vexation of his
heart , wherein he hath laboured under the sun ? </s>
<s>  For all his days
are sorrows , and his travail grief ; yea , his heart taketh not rest in
the night . </s>
<s> This is also vanity . </s>
<s> There is nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and
drink , and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour . </s>
<s> This
also I saw , that it was from the hand of God . </s>
<s> For who can eat , or who else can hasten hereunto , more than I ? </s>
<s> For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom , and
knowledge , and joy : but to the sinner he giveth travail , to gather and
to heap up , that he may give to him that is good before God . </s>
<s> This also
is vanity and vexation of spirit . </s>
<s> To every thing there is a season , and a time to every purpose

up ; 3 :4 A time to weep , and a time to laugh ; a time to mourn , and a

stones together ; a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from

the world in their heart , so that no man can find out the work that
God maketh from the beginning to the end . </s>
<s> I know that there is no good in them , but for a man to rejoice ,
and to do good in his life . </s>
<s> And also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy the good
of all his labour , it is the gift of God . </s>
<s> I know that , whatsoever God doeth , it shall be for ever : nothing
can be put to it , nor any thing taken from it : and God doeth it , that
men should fear before him . </s>
<s> That which hath been is now ; and that which is to be hath already
been ; and God requireth that which is past . </s>
<s> And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment , that
wickedness was there ; and the place of righteousness , that iniquity
was there . </s>
<s> I said in mine heart , God shall judge the righteous and the
wicked : for there is a time there for every purpose and for every
work . </s>
<s> I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men ,
that God might manifest them , and that they might see that they
themselves are beasts . </s>
<s> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts ; even
one thing befalleth them : as the one dieth , so dieth the other ; yea ,
they have all one breath ; so that a man hath no preeminence above a
beast : for all is vanity . </s>

perceive that there is nothing better , than that a man should rejoice
in his own works ; for that is his portion : for who shall bring him to
see what shall be after him ? </s>
<s> 4 :1 So I returned , and considered all
the oppressions that are done under the sun : and behold the tears of
such as were oppressed , and they had no comforter ; and on the side of
their oppressors there was power ; but they had no comforter . </s>
<s> Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the
living which are yet alive . </s>
<s> Yea , better is he than both they , which hath not yet been , who
hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun . </s>
<s> Again , I considered all travail , and every right work , that for
this a man is envied of his neighbour . </s>
<s> This is also vanity and
vexation of spirit . </s>
<s> The fool foldeth his hands together , and eateth his own flesh . </s>
<s> Better is an handful with quietness , than both the hands full with
travail and vexation of spirit . </s>
<s> Then I returned , and I saw vanity under the sun . </s>
<s> There is one alone , and there is not a second ; yea , he hath
neither child nor brother : yet is there no end of all his labour ;
neither is his eye satisfied with riches ; neither saith he , For whom
do I labour , and bereave my soul of good ? </s>
<s> This is also vanity , yea , it
is a sore travail . </s>
<s> Two are better than one ; because they have a good reward for their
labour . </s>
<s> For if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but woe to him
that is alone when he falleth ; for he hath not another to help him up . </s>
<s> Again , if two lie together , then they have heat : but how can one
be warm alone ? </s>
<s>  And if one prevail against him , two shall
withstand him ; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken . </s>
<s> Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king ,
who will no more be admonished . </s>
<s> For out of prison he cometh to reign ; whereas also he that is
born in his kingdom becometh poor . </s>
<s> I considered all the living which walk under the sun , with the
second child that shall stand up in his stead . </s>
<s> There is no end of all the people , even of all that have been
before them : they also that come after shall not rejoice in him . </s>
<s> this also is vanity and vexation of spirit . </s>
<s> Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God , and be more
ready to hear , than to give the sacrifice of fools : for they consider
not that they do evil . </s>
<s> Be not rash with thy mouth , and let not thine heart be hasty to
utter any thing before God : for God is in heaven , and thou upon earth :

vow and not pay . </s>

before the angel , that it was an error : wherefore should God be angry
at thy voice , and destroy the work of thine hands ? </s>
<s> 5 :7 For in the

fear thou God . </s>
<s> If thou seest the oppression of the poor , and violent perverting
of judgment and justice in a province , marvel not at the matter : for
he that is higher than the highest regardeth ; and there be higher than

<s> Moreover the profit of the earth is for all : the king himself is
served by the field . </s>
<s> He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver ; nor he
that loveth abundance with increase : this is also vanity . </s>
<s> When goods increase , they are increased that eat them : and what
good is there to the owners thereof , saving the beholding of them with

<s>  The sleep of a labouring man is sweet , whether he
eat little or much : but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him
to sleep . </s>
<s> There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun , namely ,

<s> Behold that which I have seen : it is good and comely for one to
eat and to drink , and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he
taketh under the sun all the days of his life , which God giveth him :

<s> Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth , and hath
given him power to eat thereof , and to take his portion , and to
rejoice in his labour ; this is the gift of God . </s>

lay it to his heart . </s>

of fools is in the house of mirth . </s>

heart . </s>

patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit . </s>
<s> Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry : for anger resteth in the
bosom of fools . </s>
<s> Say not thou , What is the cause that the former days were better
than these ? </s>
<s> for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this . </s>
<s> Wisdom is good with an inheritance : and by it there is profit to
them that see the sun . </s>
<s> For wisdom is a defence , and money is a defence : but the
excellency of knowledge is , that wisdom giveth life to them that have
it . </s>
<s> Consider the work of God : for who can make that straight , which
he hath made crooked ? </s>
<s>  In the day of prosperity be joyful , but in
the day of adversity consider : God also hath set the one over against
the other , to the end that man should find nothing after him . </s>
<s> All things have I seen in the days of my vanity : there is a just
man that perisheth in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man
that prolongeth his life in his wickedness . </s>
<s> Be not righteous over much ; neither make thyself over wise : why
shouldest thou destroy thyself  ? </s>
<s>  Be not over much wicked ,
neither be thou foolish : why shouldest thou die before thy time ? </s>
<s> 
It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this ; yea , also from this
withdraw not thine hand : for he that feareth God shall come forth of
them all . </s>
<s> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are
in the city . </s>
<s> For there is not a just man upon earth , that doeth good , and
sinneth not . </s>
<s> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken ; lest thou hear
thy servant curse thee : For oftentimes also thine own heart
knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others . </s>
<s> All this have I proved by wisdom : I said , I will be wise ; but it
was far from me . </s>
<s> That which is far off , and exceeding deep , who can find it out ? </s>
<s> I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out
wisdom , and the reason of things , and to know the wickedness of folly ,
even of foolishness and madness : And I find more bitter than
death the woman , whose heart is snares and nets , and her hands as
bands : whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her ; but the sinner shall
be taken by her . </s>
<s> Behold , this have I found , saith the preacher , counting one by
one , to find out the account : Which yet my soul seeketh , but I
find not : one man among a thousand have I found ; but a woman among all
those have I not found . </s>
<s> Lo , this only have I found , that God hath made man upright ; but
they have sought out many inventions . </s>
<s> Who is as the wise man ? </s>
<s> and who knoweth the interpretation of a
thing ? </s>
<s> a man 's wisdom maketh his face to shine , and the boldness of
his face shall be changed . </s>
<s> I counsel thee to keep the king 's commandment , and that in regard
of the oath of God . </s>
<s> Be not hasty to go out of his sight : stand not in an evil thing ;
for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him . </s>
<s> Where the word of a king is , there is power : and who may say unto
him , What doest thou ? </s>
<s> 8 :5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no
evil thing : and a wise man 's heart discerneth both time and judgment . </s>
<s> Because to every purpose there is time and judgment , therefore the
misery of man is great upon him . </s>
<s> For he knoweth not that which shall be : for who can tell him when
it shall be ? </s>
<s> 8 :8 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to
retain the spirit ; neither hath he power in the day of death : and
there is no discharge in that war ; neither shall wickedness deliver
those that are given to it . </s>
<s> All this have I seen , and applied my heart unto every work that is
done under the sun : there is a time wherein one man ruleth over
another to his own hurt . </s>
<s> And so I saw the wicked buried , who had come and gone from the
place of the holy , and they were forgotten in the city where they had
so done : this is also vanity . </s>
<s> Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily ,
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do
evil . </s>
<s> Though a sinner do evil an hundred times , and his days be
prolonged , yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear
God , which fear before him : But it shall not be well with the
wicked , neither shall he prolong his days , which are as a shadow ;
because he feareth not before God . </s>
<s> There is a vanity which is done upon the earth ; that there be
just men , unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked ;
again , there be wicked men , to whom it happeneth according to the work
of the righteous : I said that this also is vanity . </s>
<s> Then I commended mirth , because a man hath no better thing under
the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be merry : for that shall
abide with him of his labour the days of his life , which God giveth
him under the sun . </s>
<s> When I applied mine heart to know wisdom , and to see the business
that is done upon the earth : (for also there is that neither day nor
night seeth sleep with his eyes :) Then I beheld all the work of
God , that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun :
because though a man labour to seek it out , yet he shall not find it ;
yea farther ; though a wise man think to know it , yet shall he not be
able to find it . </s>
<s> For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this ,
that the righteous , and the wise , and their works , are in the hand of
God : no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them . </s>
<s> All things come alike to all : there is one event to the righteous ,
and to the wicked ; to the good and to the clean , and to the unclean ;
to him that sacrificeth , and to him that sacrificeth not : as is the
good , so is the sinner ; and he that sweareth , as he that feareth an
oath . </s>
<s> This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun , that
there is one event unto all : yea , also the heart of the sons of men is
full of evil , and madness is in their heart while they live , and after
that they go to the dead . </s>
<s> For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope : for a
living dog is better than a dead lion . </s>
<s> For the living know that they shall die : but the dead know not any
thing , neither have they any more a reward ; for the memory of them is
forgotten . </s>
<s> Also their love , and their hatred , and their envy , is now
perished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing
that is done under the sun . </s>
<s> Go thy way , eat thy bread with joy , and drink thy wine with a
merry heart ; for God now accepteth thy works . </s>
<s> Let thy garments be always white ; and let thy head lack no
ointment . </s>
<s> Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the
life of thy vanity , which he hath given thee under the sun , all the
days of thy vanity : for that is thy portion in this life , and in thy
labour which thou takest under the sun . </s>
<s> Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , do it with thy might ; for
there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in the grave ,
whither thou goest . </s>
<s> I returned , and saw under the sun , that the race is not to the
swift , nor the battle to the strong , neither yet bread to the wise ,
nor yet riches to men of understanding , nor yet favour to men of
skill ; but time and chance happeneth to them all . </s>
<s> For man also knoweth not his time : as the fishes that are taken
in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare ; so are
the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falleth suddenly upon
them . </s>
<s> This wisdom have I seen also under the sun , and it seemed great
unto me : There was a little city , and few men within it ; and
there came a great king against it , and besieged it , and built great
bulwarks against it : Now there was found in it a poor wise man ,
and he by his wisdom delivered the city ; yet no man remembered that
same poor man . </s>
<s> Then said I , Wisdom is better than strength : nevertheless the
poor man 's wisdom is despised , and his words are not heard . </s>
<s> The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him
that ruleth among fools . </s>
<s> Wisdom is better than weapons of war : but one sinner destroyeth
much good . </s>
<s> Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a
stinking savour : so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for
wisdom and honour . </s>
<s> A wise man 's heart is at his right hand ; but a fool 's heart at
his left . </s>
<s> Yea also , when he that is a fool walketh by the way , his wisdom
faileth him , and he saith to every one that he is a fool . </s>
<s> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee , leave not thy
place ; for yielding pacifieth great offences . </s>
<s> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun , as an error
which proceedeth from the ruler : Folly is set in great dignity ,
and the rich sit in low place . </s>
<s> I have seen servants upon horses , and princes walking as servants
upon the earth . </s>
<s> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it ; and whoso breaketh an
hedge , a serpent shall bite him . </s>
<s> Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith ; and he that
cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby . </s>
<s> If the iron be blunt , and he do not whet the edge , then must he
put to more strength : but wisdom is profitable to direct . </s>
<s> Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment ; and a babbler
is no better . </s>
<s> The words of a wise man 's mouth are gracious ; but the lips of a
fool will swallow up himself . </s>
<s> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness : and the
end of his talk is mischievous madness . </s>
<s> A fool also is full of words : a man cannot tell what shall be ;
and what shall be after him , who can tell him ? </s>
<s>  The labour of
the foolish wearieth every one of them , because he knoweth not how to
go to the city . </s>
<s> Woe to thee , O land , when thy king is a child , and thy princes
eat in the morning ! </s>
<s>  Blessed art thou , O land , when thy king is
the son of nobles , and thy princes eat in due season , for strength ,
and not for drunkenness ! </s>
<s>  By much slothfulness the building
decayeth ; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth
through . </s>
<s> A feast is made for laughter , and wine maketh merry : but money
answereth all things . </s>
<s> Curse not the king , no not in thy thought ; and curse not the
rich in thy bedchamber : for a bird of the air shall carry the voice ,
and that which hath wings shall tell the matter . </s>
<s> Cast thy bread upon the waters : for thou shalt find it after many
days . </s>
<s> Give a portion to seven , and also to eight ; for thou knowest not
what evil shall be upon the earth . </s>
<s> If the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the
earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in
the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be . </s>
<s> He that observeth the wind shall not sow ; and he that regardeth
the clouds shall not reap . </s>
<s> As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the
bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child : even so thou
knowest not the works of God who maketh all . </s>
<s> In the morning sow thy seed , and in the evening withhold not
thine hand : for thou knowest not whether shall prosper , either this or
that , or whether they both shall be alike good . </s>
<s> Truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes
to behold the sun : But if a man live many years , and rejoice in
them all ; yet let him remember the days of darkness ; for they shall be
many . </s>
<s> All that cometh is vanity . </s>
<s> Rejoice , O young man , in thy youth ; and let thy heart cheer thee
in the days of thy youth , and walk in the ways of thine heart , and in
the sight of thine eyes : but know thou , that for all these things God
will bring thee into judgment . </s>
<s> Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart , and put away evil from
thy flesh : for childhood and youth are vanity . </s>
<s> Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth , while the evil
days come not , nor the years draw nigh , when thou shalt say , I have no
pleasure in them ; While the sun , or the light , or the moon , or
the stars , be not darkened , nor the clouds return after the rain : 
In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble , and the strong
men shall bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few ,
and those that look out of the windows be darkened , And the doors
shall be shut in the streets , when the sound of the grinding is low ,
and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the daughters
of musick shall be brought low ; Also when they shall be afraid of
that which is high , and fears shall be in the way , and the almond tree
shall flourish , and the grasshopper shall be a burden , and desire
shall fail : because man goeth to his long home , and the mourners go
about the streets : Or ever the silver cord be loosed , or the
golden bowl be broken , or the pitcher be broken at the fountain , or
the wheel broken at the cistern . </s>
<s> Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was : and the spirit
shall return unto God who gave it . </s>
<s> Vanity of vanities , saith the preacher ; all is vanity . </s>
<s> And moreover , because the preacher was wise , he still taught the
people knowledge ; yea , he gave good heed , and sought out , and set in
order many proverbs . </s>
<s> The preacher sought to find out acceptable words : and that which
was written was upright , even words of truth . </s>
<s> The words of the wise are as goads , and as nails fastened by the
masters of assemblies , which are given from one shepherd . </s>
<s> And further , by these , my son , be admonished : of making many
books there is no end ; and much study is a weariness of the flesh . </s>
<s> Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter : Fear God , and
keep his commandments : for this is the whole duty of man . </s>
<s> For God shall bring every work into judgment , with every secret
thing , whether it be good , or whether it be evil . </s>

<s> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me ? </s>
<s> the LORD : I am full of the burnt offerings of rams , and the fat

lambs , or of he goats . </s>
<s> When ye come to appear before me , who hath required this at your
hand , to tread my courts ? </s>
<s>  Bring no more vain oblations ; incense

<s> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth : they are

<s> Also I heard the voice of the Lord , saying , Whom shall I send , and

it , and let us make a breach therein for us , and set a king in the

<s> For the head of Syria is Damascus , and the head of Damascus is
Rezin ; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken ,

Remaliah 's son . </s>

above . </s>
<s> But Ahaz said , I will not ask , neither will I tempt the LORD . </s>
<s> And he said , Hear ye now , O house of David ; Is it a small thing

departed from Judah ; even the king of Assyria . </s>

<s> And it shall come to pass in that day , that a man shall nourish a

<s> With arrows and with bows shall men come thither ; because all the
land shall become briers and thorns . </s>
<s> And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock , there
shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns : but it shall be

<s> Moreover the LORD said unto me , Take thee a great roll , and write

of Assyria , and all his glory : and he shall come up over all his

<s> Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation ,

down to the earth with the hand . </s>

under feet : And the glorious beauty , which is on the head of the

<s> But they also have erred through wine , and through strong drink

<s> To whom he said , This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
weary to rest ; and this is the refreshing : yet they would not hear . </s>

broken , and snared , and taken . </s>
<s> Wherefore hear the word of the LORD , ye scornful men , that rule
this people which is in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> Because ye have said , We have made a covenant with death , and
with hell are we at agreement ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass
through , it shall not come unto us : for we have made lies our refuge ,
and under falsehood have we hid ourselves : Therefore thus saith
the Lord GOD , Behold , I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone , a tried
stone , a precious corner stone , a sure foundation : he that believeth
shall not make haste . </s>
<s> Judgment also will I lay to the line , and righteousness to the
plummet : and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies , and the
waters shall overflow the hiding place . </s>
<s> And your covenant with death shall be disannulled , and your
agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the overflowing scourge
shall pass through , then ye shall be trodden down by it . </s>
<s> From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you : for morning
by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a
vexation only to understand the report . </s>
<s> For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
it : and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it . </s>
<s> For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim , he shall be
wroth as in the valley of Gibeon , that he may do his work , his strange
work ; and bring to pass his act , his strange act . </s>
<s> Now therefore be ye not mockers , lest your bands be made strong :

marvellous work among this people , even a marvellous work and a
wonder : for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish , and the

<s> Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
LORD , and their works are in the dark , and they say , Who seeth us ? </s>

<s>  Surely your turning of things upside down shall

<s> Woe to the rebellious children , saith the LORD , that take
counsel , but not of me ; and that cover with a covering , but not of my

Egypt , and have not asked at my mouth ; to strengthen themselves in the
strength of Pharaoh , and to trust in the shadow of Egypt ! </s>
<s>

<s> The burden of the beasts of the south : into the land of trouble

an instant . </s>
<s> And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters ' vessel

ye flee : and , We will ride upon the swift ; therefore shall they that
pursue you be swift . </s>
<s> One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one ; at the rebuke of
five shall ye flee : till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a
mountain , and as an ensign on an hill . </s>

you , and therefore will he be exalted , that he may have mercy upon
you : for the LORD is a God of judgment : blessed are all they that wait
for him . </s>
<s> For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem : thou shalt weep
no more : he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry ;
when he shall hear it , he will answer thee . </s>
<s> And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity , and the
water of affliction , yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a
corner any more , but thine eyes shall see thy teachers : And
thine ears shall hear a word behind thee , saying , This is the way ,
walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the
left . </s>
<s> Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
silver , and the ornament of thy molten images of gold : thou shalt cast
them away as a menstruous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , Get thee
hence . </s>

<s> Behold , the name of the LORD cometh from far , burning with his
anger , and the burden thereof is heavy : his lips are full of
indignation , and his tongue as a devouring fire : And his breath ,
as an overflowing stream , shall reach to the midst of the neck , to
sift the nations with the sieve of vanity : and there shall be a bridle
in the jaws of the people , causing them to err . </s>
<s> Ye shall have a song , as in the night when a holy solemnity is
kept ; and gladness of heart , as when one goeth with a pipe to come
into the mountain of the LORD , to the mighty One of Israel . </s>
<s> And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard , and
shall shew the lighting down of his arm , with the indignation of his
anger , and with the flame of a devouring fire , with scattering , and
tempest , and hailstones . </s>
<s> For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten
down , which smote with a rod . </s>

the LORD shall lay upon him , it shall be with tabrets and harps : and
in battles of shaking will he fight with it . </s>
<s> For Tophet is ordained of old ; yea , for the king it is prepared ;
he hath made it deep and large : the pile thereof is fire and much
wood ; the breath of the LORD , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle
it . </s>

<s> When the LORD shall stretch out his hand , both he that
helpeth shall fall , and he that is holpen shall fall down , and they
all shall fail together . </s>
<s> For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me , Like as the lion and the
young lion roaring on his prey , when a multitude of shepherds is
called forth against him , he will not be afraid of their voice , nor
abase himself for the noise of them : so shall the LORD of hosts come
down to fight for mount Zion , and for the hill thereof . </s>
<s> As birds flying , so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem ;

it . </s>

revolted . </s>

sin . </s>
<s> Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword , not of a mighty man ;

princes shall be afraid of the ensign , saith the LORD , whose fire is
in Zion , and his furnace in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> Behold , a king shall reign in righteousness , and princes shall
rule in judgment . </s>

them that hear shall hearken . </s>
<s> The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge , and the
tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly . </s>
<s> The vile person shall be no more called liberal , nor the churl
said to be bountiful . </s>
<s> For the vile person will speak villany , and his heart will work
iniquity , to practise hypocrisy , and to utter error against the LORD ,

devices to destroy the poor with lying words , even when the needy
speaketh right . </s>

righteousness quietness and assurance for ever . </s>

<s> It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh , whom

<s> So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah . </s>

<s> And when he heard it , he sent messengers

Assyria . </s>
<s> Behold , thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to

Ivah ? </s>
<s>  And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the

LORD , and spread it before the LORD . </s>
<s> And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD , saying , O LORD of

<s> now have I brought it to pass , that thou

<s> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were
dismayed and confounded : they were as the grass of the field , and as

before it be grown up . </s>
<s> But I know thy abode , and thy going out , and thy coming in , and
thy rage against me . </s>
<s> Because thy rage against me , and thy tumult , is come up into
mine ears , therefore will I put my hook in thy nose , and my bridle in
thy lips , and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest . </s>
<s> And this shall be a sign unto thee , Ye shall eat this year such

same : and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and
eat the fruit thereof . </s>
<s> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
again take root downward , and bear fruit upward : For out of
Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount
Zion : the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this . </s>
<s> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria , He

<s> And it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of

the LORD , Set thine house in order : for thou shalt die , and not live . </s>
<s> Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall , and prayed unto
the LORD , And said , Remember now , O LORD , I beseech thee , how I

done that which is good in thy sight . </s>
<s> And Hezekiah wept sore . </s>
<s> Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah , saying , Go , and

<s> Behold , for peace I had great bitterness : but thou hast in love

did esteem him stricken , smitten of God , and afflicted . </s>

iniquities : the chastisement of our peace was upon him ; and with his
stripes we are healed . </s>
<s> All we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to
his own way ; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all . </s>
<s> He was oppressed , and he was afflicted , yet he opened not his
mouth : he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before
her shearers is dumb , so he openeth not his mouth . </s>
<s> He was taken from prison and from judgment : and who shall declare
his generation ? </s>
<s> for he was cut off out of the land of the living : for

death ; because he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his
mouth . </s>

bear their iniquities . </s>
<s> Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great , and he

please , and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it . </s>
<s> For ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the

himself a prey : and the LORD saw it , and it displeased him that there
was no judgment . </s>
<s> And he saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no
intercessor : therefore his arm brought salvation unto him ; and his

<s> Thy holy cities are a wilderness , Zion is a wilderness ,
Jerusalem a desolation . </s>

<s>  I am sought of them
that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said ,
Behold me , behold me , unto a nation that was not called by my name . </s>
<s> I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people ,
which walketh in a way that was not good , after their own thoughts ;
 A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face ; that
sacrificeth in gardens , and burneth incense upon altars of brick ; 
Which remain among the graves , and lodge in the monuments , which eat
swine 's flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
 Which say , Stand by thyself , come not near to me ; for I am holier

<s> These are a smoke in my nose , a fire that burneth all the
day . </s>
<s> Behold , it is written before me : I will not keep silence , but
will recompense , even recompense into their bosom , Your
iniquities , and the iniquities of your fathers together , saith the
LORD , which have burned incense upon the mountains , and blasphemed me
upon the hills : therefore will I measure their former work into their
bosom . </s>
<s> Thus saith the LORD , As the new wine is found in the cluster , and
one saith , Destroy it not ; for a blessing is in it : so will I do for
my servants ' sakes , that I may not destroy them all . </s>
<s> And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an
inheritor of my mountains : and mine elect shall inherit it , and my
servants shall dwell there . </s>
<s> And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks , and the valley of Achor a
place for the herds to lie down in , for my people that have sought me . </s>
<s> But ye are they that forsake the LORD , that forget my holy
mountain , that prepare a table for that troop , and that furnish the
drink offering unto that number . </s>
<s> Therefore will I number you to the sword , and ye shall all bow
down to the slaughter : because when I called , ye did not answer ; when
I spake , ye did not hear ; but did evil before mine eyes , and did
choose that wherein I delighted not . </s>
<s> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD , Behold , my servants shall
eat , but ye shall be hungry : behold , my servants shall drink , but ye
shall be thirsty : behold , my servants shall rejoice , but ye shall be
ashamed : Behold , my servants shall sing for joy of heart , but ye
shall cry for sorrow of heart , and shall howl for vexation of spirit . </s>
<s> And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen : for the
Lord GOD shall slay thee , and call his servants by another name : 
That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the
God of truth ; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God
of truth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they
are hid from mine eyes . </s>
<s> For , behold , I create new heavens and a new earth : and the
former shall not be remembered , nor come into mind . </s>
<s> But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create : for ,
behold , I create Jerusalem a rejoicing , and her people a joy . </s>
<s> And I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people : and the
voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of
crying . </s>
<s> There shall be no more thence an infant of days , nor an old man
that hath not filled his days : for the child shall die an hundred
years old ; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be
accursed . </s>
<s> And they shall build houses , and inhabit them ; and they shall
plant vineyards , and eat the fruit of them . </s>
<s> They shall not build , and another inhabit ; they shall not plant ,
and another eat : for as the days of a tree are the days of my people ,

<s> They shall not labour in vain , nor bring forth for trouble ; for
they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD , and their offspring with
them . </s>
<s> And it shall come to pass , that before they call , I will answer ;
and while they are yet speaking , I will hear . </s>
<s> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together , and the lion shall
eat straw like the bullock : and dust shall be the serpent 's meat . </s>

<s> Thus saith the LORD , The heaven is my throne , and the earth is my
footstool : where is the house that ye build unto me ? </s>

look , even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit , and trembleth
at my word . </s>
<s> He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man ; he that sacrificeth
a lamb , as if he cut off a dog 's neck ; he that offereth an oblation ,
as if he offered swine 's blood ; he that burneth incense , as if he
blessed an idol . </s>
<s> they have chosen their own ways , and their soul delighteth in
their abominations . </s>
<s> I also will choose their delusions , and will bring their fears
upon them ; because when I called , none did answer ; when I spake , they
did not hear : but they did evil before mine eyes , and chose that in
which I delighted not . </s>
<s> Hear the word of the LORD , ye that tremble at his word ; Your
brethren that hated you , that cast you out for my name 's sake , said ,
Let the LORD be glorified : but he shall appear to your joy , and they
shall be ashamed . </s>

<s> Shall the
earth be made to bring forth in one day ? </s>
<s> or shall a nation be born at
once ? </s>
<s> for as soon as Zion travailed , she brought forth her children . </s>
<s> Shall I bring to the birth , and not cause to bring forth ? </s>
<s> saith
the LORD : shall I cause to bring forth , and shut the womb ? </s>
<s> saith thy
God . </s>
<s> Rejoice ye with Jerusalem , and be glad with her , all ye that
love her : rejoice for joy with her , all ye that mourn for her : 
That ye may suck , and be satisfied with the breasts of her
consolations ; that ye may milk out , and be delighted with the
abundance of her glory . </s>
<s> For thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will extend peace to her like
a river , and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream : then
shall ye suck , ye shall be borne upon her sides , and be dandled upon
her knees . </s>
<s> As one whom his mother comforteth , so will I comfort you ; and ye
shall be comforted in Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And when ye see this , your heart shall rejoice , and your bones
shall flourish like an herb : and the hand of the LORD shall be known
toward his servants , and his indignation toward his enemies . </s>
<s> For , behold , the LORD will come with fire , and with his chariots
like a whirlwind , to render his anger with fury , and his rebuke with
flames of fire . </s>
<s> For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh :
and the slain of the LORD shall be many . </s>
<s> They that sanctify themselves , and purify themselves in the
gardens behind one tree in the midst , eating swine 's flesh , and the
abomination , and the mouse , shall be consumed together , saith the
LORD . </s>
<s> For I know their works and their thoughts : it shall come , that I
will gather all nations and tongues ; and they shall come , and see my
glory . </s>
<s> And I will set a sign among them , and I will send those that
escape of them unto the nations , to Tarshish , Pul , and Lud , that draw
the bow , to Tubal , and Javan , to the isles afar off , that have not
heard my fame , neither have seen my glory ; and they shall declare my
glory among the Gentiles . </s>
<s> And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the
LORD out of all nations upon horses , and in chariots , and in litters ,
and upon mules , and upon swift beasts , to my holy mountain Jerusalem ,
saith the LORD , as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean
vessel into the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites , saith
the LORD . </s>
<s> For as the new heavens and the new earth , which I will make ,
shall remain before me , saith the LORD , so shall your seed and your
name remain . </s>
<s> And it shall come to pass , that from one new moon to another ,
and from one sabbath to another , shall all flesh come to worship
before me , saith the LORD . </s>
<s> And they shall go forth , and look upon the carcases of the men
that have transgressed against me : for their worm shall not die ,

unto all flesh . </s>

<s> All my familiars watched for my

Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath ; where he gave judgment upon
him . </s>
<s> And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his
eyes : he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah . </s>
<s> Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah ; and the king of Babylon
bound him in chains , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison
till the day of his death . </s>
<s> Now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was
the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , came
Nebuzaradan , captain of the guard , which served the king of Babylon ,
into Jerusalem , And burned the house of the LORD , and the king 's
house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , and all the houses of the
great men , burned he with fire : And all the army of the
Chaldeans , that were with the captain of the guard , brake down all the
walls of Jerusalem round about . </s>
<s> Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
certain of the poor of the people , and the residue of the people that
remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to the king
of Babylon , and the rest of the multitude . </s>
<s> But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the
poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen . </s>
<s> Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD ,
and the bases , and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD ,
the Chaldeans brake , and carried all the brass of them to Babylon . </s>
<s> The caldrons also , and the shovels , and the snuffers , and the
bowls , and the spoons , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they
ministered , took they away . </s>
<s> And the basons , and the firepans , and the bowls , and the
caldrons , and the candlesticks , and the spoons , and the cups ; that
which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver ,
took the captain of the guard away . </s>
<s> The two pillars , one sea , and twelve brasen bulls that were
under the bases , which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD :
the brass of all these vessels was without weight . </s>
<s> And concerning the pillars , the height of one pillar was
eighteen cubits ; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it ; and the
thickness thereof was four fingers : it was hollow . </s>
<s> And a chapiter of brass was upon it ; and the height of one
chapiter was five cubits , with network and pomegranates upon the
chapiters round about , all of brass . </s>
<s> The second pillar also and the
pomegranates were like unto these . </s>
<s> And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side ; and all
the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about . </s>
<s> And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest , and
Zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the door : 
He took also out of the city an eunuch , which had the charge of the
men of war ; and seven men of them that were near the king 's person ,
which were found in the city ; and the principal scribe of the host ,
who mustered the people of the land ; and threescore men of the people
of the land , that were found in the midst of the city . </s>
<s> So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought
them to the king of Babylon to Riblah . </s>
<s> And the king of Babylon smote them , and put them to death in
Riblah in the land of Hamath . </s>
<s> Thus Judah was carried away captive out
of his own land . </s>
<s> This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive : in
the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty : In
the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from
Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons : In the three and
twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard
carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons :
all the persons were four thousand and six hundred . </s>
<s> And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah , in the twelfth month , in the
five and twentieth day of the month , that Evilmerodach king of Babylon
in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king
of Judah , and brought him forth out of prison . </s>
<s> And spake kindly unto him , and set his throne above the throne
of the kings that were with him in Babylon , And changed his
prison garments : and he did continually eat bread before him all the
days of his life . </s>
<s> And for his diet , there was a continual diet given him of the
king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all
the days of his life . </s>

<s> The word of the LORD came again unto me , saying , Son of man ,

<s> Thus she committed her whoredoms with them , with all them that
were the chosen men of Assyria , and with all on whom she doted : with

<s> Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt : for in her
youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her
virginity , and poured their whoredom upon her . </s>
<s> Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers , into

<s> These discovered her nakedness : they took her sons and her
daughters , and slew her with the sword : and she became famous among
women ; for they had executed judgment upon her . </s>
<s> And when her sister Aholibah saw this , she was more corrupt in
her inordinate love than she , and in her whoredoms more than her
sister in her whoredoms . </s>
<s> She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours , captains and rulers
clothed most gorgeously , horsemen riding upon horses , all of them
desirable young men . </s>
<s> Then I saw that she was defiled , that they took both one way ,

pourtrayed upon the wall , the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with
vermilion , Girded with girdles upon their loins , exceeding in
dyed attire upon their heads , all of them princes to look to , after
the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea , the land of their nativity :
 And as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she doted upon them ,
and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea . </s>
<s> And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love , and they
defiled her with their whoredom , and she was polluted with them , and
her mind was alienated from them . </s>
<s> So she discovered her whoredoms , and discovered her nakedness :

<s> Yet she multiplied her whoredoms , in calling to remembrance the

Egypt . </s>
<s> For she doted upon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh

<s> Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth , in

<s> Therefore , O Aholibah , thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will

lords and renowned , all of them riding upon horses . </s>
<s> And they shall come against thee with chariots , wagons , and

<s> For thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will deliver thee into

shall take away all thy labour , and shall leave thee naked and bare :

lewdness and thy whoredoms . </s>
<s> I will do these things unto thee , because thou hast gone a
whoring after the heathen , and because thou art polluted with their
idols . </s>
<s> Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister ; therefore will I give
her cup into thine hand . </s>
<s> Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Thou shalt drink of thy sister 's cup

<s> Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out , and thou shalt break

it , saith the Lord GOD . </s>
<s> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thou hast forgotten
me , and cast me behind thy back , therefore bear thou also thy lewdness
and thy whoredoms . </s>
<s> The LORD said moreover unto me ; Son of man , wilt thou judge
Aholah and Aholibah ? </s>
<s> yea , declare unto them their abominations ;

<s> Moreover this they have done unto me : they have defiled my

<s> For when they had slain their children to their idols , then they

<s> And furthermore , that ye have sent for men to come from far ,

<s> Now the upper chambers were shorter : for the galleries were
higher than these , than the lower , and than the middlemost of the

was troubled to know the dream . </s>
<s> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack , O king , live for
ever : tell thy servants the dream , and we will shew the
interpretation . </s>
<s> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans , The thing is gone

<s> The king answered and said , I know of certainty that ye would gain
the time , because ye see the thing is gone from me . </s>
<s> But if ye will not make known unto me the dream , there is but one
decree for you : for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak
before me , till the time be changed : therefore tell me the dream , and
I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof . </s>
<s> The Chaldeans answered before the king , and said , There is not a

no king , lord , nor ruler , that asked such things at any magician , or
astrologer , or Chaldean . </s>
<s> And it is a rare thing that the king requireth , and there is none
other that can shew it before the king , except the gods , whose
dwelling is not with flesh . </s>
<s> For this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded
to destroy all the wise men of Babylon . </s>
<s> And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain ; and
they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain . </s>
<s> Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
captain of the king 's guard , which was gone forth to slay the wise men
of Babylon : He answered and said to Arioch the king 's captain ,
Why is the decree so hasty from the king ? </s>
<s> Then Arioch made the thing
known to Daniel . </s>
<s> Then Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would give
him time , and that he would shew the king the interpretation . </s>
<s> Then Daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to
Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , his companions : That they would
desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret ; that
Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men
of Babylon . </s>
<s> Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision . </s>
<s> Then
Daniel blessed the God of heaven . </s>
<s> Daniel answered and said , Blessed be the name of God for ever and

the seasons : he removeth kings , and setteth up kings : he giveth wisdom
unto the wise , and knowledge to them that know understanding : He
revealeth the deep and secret things : he knoweth what is in the
darkness , and the light dwelleth with him . </s>
<s> I thank thee , and praise thee , O thou God of my fathers , who hast
given me wisdom and might , and hast made known unto me now what we

<s> Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch , whom the king had ordained
to destroy the wise men of Babylon : he went and said thus unto him ;

<s> Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste , and said
thus unto him , I have found a man of the captives of Judah , that will
make known unto the king the interpretation . </s>
<s> The king answered and said to Daniel , whose name was
Belteshazzar , Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I

<s>  Daniel answered in

what shall be in the latter days . </s>
<s> Thy dream , and the visions of thy

<s> But as for me , this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom

silver , his belly and his thighs of brass , His legs of iron , his
feet part of iron and part of clay . </s>

smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay , and brake
them to pieces . </s>
<s> Then was the iron , the clay , the brass , the silver , and the gold ,

found for them : and the stone that smote the image became a great
mountain , and filled the whole earth . </s>
<s> This is the dream ; and we will tell the interpretation thereof
before the king . </s>
<s> Thou , O king , art a king of kings : for the God of heaven hath
given thee a kingdom , power , and strength , and glory . </s>
<s> And wheresoever the children of men dwell , the beasts of the
field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand , and
hath made thee ruler over them all . </s>
<s> Thou art this head of gold . </s>
<s> And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee , and
another third kingdom of brass , which shall bear rule over all the
earth . </s>
<s> And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron : forasmuch as iron
breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things : and as iron that breaketh
all these , shall it break in pieces and bruise . </s>
<s> And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes , part of potters ' clay ,
and part of iron , the kingdom shall be divided ; but there shall be in
it of the strength of the iron , forasmuch as thou sawest the iron
mixed with miry clay . </s>
<s> And as the toes of the feet were part of iron , and part of clay ,
so the kingdom shall be partly strong , and partly broken . </s>
<s> And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay , they shall
mingle themselves with the seed of men : but they shall not cleave one
to another , even as iron is not mixed with clay . </s>
<s> And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a
kingdom , which shall never be destroyed : and the kingdom shall not be
left to other people , but it shall break in pieces and consume all
these kingdoms , and it shall stand for ever . </s>
<s> Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
mountain without hands , and that it brake in pieces the iron , the
brass , the clay , the silver , and the gold ; the great God hath made
known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter : and the dream is
certain , and the interpretation thereof sure . </s>
<s> Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face , and worshipped
Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet

<s> The king answered unto Daniel , and said , Of a truth it is , that

<s> Then the king made Daniel a great man , and gave him many great
gifts , and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon , and

it , and the fowls from his branches : Nevertheless leave the stump

<s> And when he came to the den , he cried with a lamentable voice
unto Daniel : and the king spake and said to Daniel , O Daniel , servant
of the living God , is thy God , whom thou servest continually , able to
deliver thee from the lions ? </s>
<s>  Then said Daniel unto the king , O
king , live for ever . </s>
<s> My God hath sent his angel , and hath shut the lions ' mouths , that
they have not hurt me : forasmuch as before him innocency was found in
me ; and also before thee , O king , have I done no hurt . </s>
<s> Then was the king exceedingly glad for him , and commanded that
they should take Daniel up out of the den . </s>
<s> So Daniel was taken up out
of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he
believed in his God . </s>
<s> And the king commanded , and they brought those men which had
accused Daniel , and they cast them into the den of lions , them , their
children , and their wives ; and the lions had the mastery of them , and
brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the
den . </s>
<s> Then king Darius wrote unto all people , nations , and languages ,
that dwell in all the earth ; Peace be multiplied unto you . </s>
<s> I make a decree , That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble
and fear before the God of Daniel : for he is the living God , and
stedfast for ever , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed ,
and his dominion shall be even unto the end . </s>
<s> He delivereth and rescueth , and he worketh signs and wonders in
heaven and in earth , who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the
lions . </s>
<s> So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius , and in the reign
of Cyrus the Persian . </s>
<s> In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream
and visions of his head upon his bed : then he wrote the dream , and
told the sum of the matters . </s>
<s> Daniel spake and said , I saw in my vision by night , and , behold ,
the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea . </s>
<s> And four great beasts came up from the sea , diverse one from
another . </s>
<s> The first was like a lion , and had eagle 's wings : I beheld till
the wings thereof were plucked , and it was lifted up from the earth ,
and made stand upon the feet as a man , and a man 's heart was given to
it . </s>
<s> And behold another beast , a second , like to a bear , and it raised
up itself on one side , and it had three ribs in the mouth of it
between the teeth of it : and they said thus unto it , Arise , devour
much flesh . </s>
<s> After this I beheld , and lo another , like a leopard , which had
upon the back of it four wings of a fowl ; the beast had also four
heads ; and dominion was given to it . </s>
<s> After this I saw in the night visions , and behold a fourth beast ,
dreadful and terrible , and strong exceedingly ; and it had great iron
teeth : it devoured and brake in pieces , and stamped the residue with
the feet of it : and it was diverse from all the beasts that were
before it ; and it had ten horns . </s>
<s> I considered the horns , and , behold , there came up among them
another little horn , before whom there were three of the first horns
plucked up by the roots : and , behold , in this horn were eyes like the
eyes of man , and a mouth speaking great things . </s>
<s> I beheld till the thrones were cast down , and the Ancient of days
did sit , whose garment was white as snow , and the hair of his head
like the pure wool : his throne was like the fiery flame , and his
wheels as burning fire . </s>
<s> A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousand
thousands ministered unto him , and ten thousand times ten thousand
stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened . </s>
<s> I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the
horn spake : I beheld even till the beast was slain , and his body
destroyed , and given to the burning flame . </s>
<s> As concerning the rest of the beasts , they had their dominion
taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time . </s>
<s> I saw in the night visions , and , behold , one like the Son of man
came with the clouds of heaven , and came to the Ancient of days , and
they brought him near before him . </s>
<s> And there was given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that
all people , nations , and languages , should serve him : his dominion is
an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom
that which shall not be destroyed . </s>
<s> I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body , and
the visions of my head troubled me . </s>
<s> I came near unto one of them that stood by , and asked him the
truth of all this . </s>
<s> So he told me , and made me know the interpretation
of the things . </s>
<s> These great beasts , which are four , are four kings , which shall
arise out of the earth . </s>
<s> But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom , and
possess the kingdom for ever , even for ever and ever . </s>
<s> Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast , which was
diverse from all the others , exceeding dreadful , whose teeth were of
iron , and his nails of brass ; which devoured , brake in pieces , and
stamped the residue with his feet ; And of the ten horns that were
in his head , and of the other which came up , and before whom three
fell ; even of that horn that had eyes , and a mouth that spake very
great things , whose look was more stout than his fellows . </s>
<s> I beheld , and the same horn made war with the saints , and
prevailed against them ; Until the Ancient of days came , and
judgment was given to the saints of the most High ; and the time came
that the saints possessed the kingdom . </s>
<s> Thus he said , The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon
earth , which shall be diverse from all kingdoms , and shall devour the
whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces . </s>
<s> And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall
arise : and another shall rise after them ; and he shall be diverse from
the first , and he shall subdue three kings . </s>
<s> And he shall speak great words against the most High , and shall
wear out the saints of the most High , and think to change times and
laws : and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and
the dividing of time . </s>
<s> But the judgment shall sit , and they shall take away his
dominion , to consume and to destroy it unto the end . </s>
<s> And the kingdom and dominion , and the greatness of the kingdom
under the whole heaven , shall be given to the people of the saints of
the most High , whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and all
dominions shall serve and obey him . </s>
<s> Hitherto is the end of the matter . </s>
<s> As for me Daniel , my
cogitations much troubled me , and my countenance changed in me : but I
kept the matter in my heart . </s>
<s> In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
appeared unto me , even unto me Daniel , after that which appeared unto
me at the first . </s>
<s> And I saw in a vision ; and it came to pass , when I saw , that I was
at Shushan in the palace , which is in the province of Elam ; and I saw
in a vision , and I was by the river of Ulai . </s>
<s> Then I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , behold , there stood
before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were
high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last . </s>
<s> I saw the ram pushing westward , and northward , and southward ; so
that no beasts might stand before him , neither was there any that
could deliver out of his hand ; but he did according to his will , and
became great . </s>
<s> And as I was considering , behold , an he goat came from the west on
the face of the whole earth , and touched not the ground : and the goat
had a notable horn between his eyes . </s>
<s> And he came to the ram that had two horns , which I had seen
standing before the river , and ran unto him in the fury of his power . </s>
<s> And I saw him come close unto the ram , and he was moved with
choler against him , and smote the ram , and brake his two horns : and
there was no power in the ram to stand before him , but he cast him
down to the ground , and stamped upon him : and there was none that
could deliver the ram out of his hand . </s>
<s> Therefore the he goat waxed very great : and when he was strong ,
the great horn was broken ; and for it came up four notable ones toward
the four winds of heaven . </s>
<s> And out of one of them came forth a little horn , which waxed
exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the
pleasant land . </s>
<s> And it waxed great , even to the host of heaven ; and it cast down
some of the host and of the stars to the ground , and stamped upon
them . </s>
<s> Yea , he magnified himself even to the prince of the host , and by
him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of the sanctuary
was cast down . </s>
<s> And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason
of transgression , and it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it
practised , and prospered . </s>
<s> Then I heard one saint speaking , and another saint said unto that
certain saint which spake , How long shall be the vision concerning the
daily sacrifice , and the transgression of desolation , to give both the
sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot ? </s>
<s>  And he said
unto me , Unto two thousand and three hundred days ; then shall the
sanctuary be cleansed . </s>
<s> And it came to pass , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision ,
and sought for the meaning , then , behold , there stood before me as the
appearance of a man . </s>
<s> And I heard a man 's voice between the banks of Ulai , which
called , and said , Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision . </s>
<s> So he came near where I stood : and when he came , I was afraid ,
and fell upon my face : but he said unto me , Understand , O son of man :
for at the time of the end shall be the vision . </s>
<s> Now as he was speaking with me , I was in a deep sleep on my face
toward the ground : but he touched me , and set me upright . </s>
<s> And he said , Behold , I will make thee know what shall be in the
last end of the indignation : for at the time appointed the end shall
be . </s>
<s> The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media
and Persia . </s>
<s> And the rough goat is the king of Grecia : and the great horn that
is between his eyes is the first king . </s>
<s> Now that being broken , whereas four stood up for it , four
kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation , but not in his power . </s>
<s> And in the latter time of their kingdom , when the transgressors
are come to the full , a king of fierce countenance , and understanding
dark sentences , shall stand up . </s>
<s> And his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power : and he
shall destroy wonderfully , and shall prosper , and practise , and shall
destroy the mighty and the holy people . </s>
<s> And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in
his hand ; and he shall magnify himself in his heart , and by peace
shall destroy many : he shall also stand up against the Prince of
princes ; but he shall be broken without hand . </s>
<s> And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is
true : wherefore shut thou up the vision ; for it shall be for many
days . </s>
<s> And I Daniel fainted , and was sick certain days ; afterward I rose
up , and did the king 's business ; and I was astonished at the vision ,
but none understood it . </s>
<s> In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus , of the seed of
the Medes , which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans ; 9 :2 In
the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of

that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of
Jerusalem . </s>
<s> And I set my face unto the Lord God , to seek by prayer and
supplications , with fasting , and sackcloth , and ashes : 9 :4 And I
prayed unto the LORD my God , and made my confession , and said , O Lord ,

that love him , and to them that keep his commandments ; 9 :5 We have
sinned , and have committed iniquity , and have done wickedly , and have
rebelled , even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments :

spake in thy name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to
all the people of the land . </s>
<s> O LORD , righteousness belongeth unto thee , but unto us confusion
of faces , as at this day ; to the men of Judah , and to the inhabitants
of Jerusalem , and unto all Israel , that are near , and that are far
off , through all the countries whither thou hast driven them , because
of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee . </s>
<s> O Lord , to us belongeth confusion of face , to our kings , to our

<s> To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses , though we

<s> Yea , all Israel have transgressed thy law , even by departing ,

us , and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of
God , because we have sinned against him . </s>
<s> And he hath confirmed his words , which he spake against us , and
against our judges that judged us , by bringing upon us a great evil :

Jerusalem . </s>
<s> As it is written in the law of Moses , all this evil is come upon
us : yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God , that we might
turn from our iniquities , and understand thy truth . </s>
<s> Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil , and brought it
upon us : for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he
doeth : for we obeyed not his voice . </s>
<s> And now , O Lord our God , that hast brought thy people forth out
of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and hast gotten thee renown ,
as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly . </s>
<s> O LORD , according to all thy righteousness , I beseech thee , let
thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem , thy
holy mountain : because for our sins , and for the iniquities of our
fathers , Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that
are about us . </s>
<s> Now therefore , O our God , hear the prayer of thy servant , and his
supplications , and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is
desolate , for the Lord 's sake . </s>
<s> O my God , incline thine ear , and hear ; open thine eyes , and

<s> Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy

<s> And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week : and in

<s> In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed

multitude . </s>
<s> And I Daniel alone saw the vision : for the men that were with me
saw not the vision ; but a great quaking fell upon them , so that they
fled to hide themselves . </s>
<s> Therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there
remained no strength in me : for my comeliness was turned in me into
corruption , and I retained no strength . </s>
<s> Yet heard I the voice of his words : and when I heard the voice of
his words , then was I in a deep sleep on my face , and my face toward
the ground . </s>
<s> And , behold , an hand touched me , which set me upon my knees and

<s> Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede , even I , stood to

<s> And now will I shew thee the truth . </s>
<s> Behold , there shall stand up

<s> And the king of the south shall be strong , and one of his
princes ; and he shall be strong above him , and have dominion ; his
dominion shall be a great dominion . </s>
<s> And in the end of years they shall join themselves together ; for
the king 's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north

her in these times . </s>
<s> But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his

north . </s>
<s> So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom , and shall
return into his own land . </s>
<s> But his sons shall be stirred up , and shall assemble a multitude

fortress . </s>
<s> And the king of the south shall be moved with choler , and shall
come forth and fight with him , even with the king of the north : and he
shall set forth a great multitude ; but the multitude shall be given
into his hand . </s>
<s> And when he hath taken away the multitude , his heart shall be
lifted up ; and he shall cast down many ten thousands : but he shall not

<s> He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the

holds , even for a time . </s>
<s> And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king

not stand : for they shall forecast devices against him . </s>
<s> Yea , they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
him , and his army shall overflow : and many shall fall down slain . </s>
<s> And both of these kings ' hearts shall be to do mischief , and
they shall speak lies at one table ; but it shall not prosper : for yet

<s> Then shall he return into his land with great riches ; and his
heart shall be against the holy covenant ; and he shall do exploits ,

<s> At the time appointed he shall return , and come toward the
south ; but it shall not be as the former , or as the latter . </s>

shall be grieved , and return , and have indignation against the holy
covenant : so shall he do ; he shall even return , and have intelligence

<s> And they that understand among the people shall instruct many :

spoil , many days . </s>
<s> Now when they shall fall , they shall be holpen with a little

<s> And some of them of understanding shall fall , to try them , and
to purge , and to make them white , even to the time of the end : because

<s> Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god ,

<s> And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at

<s> He shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries

none shall help him . </s>
<s> And at that time shall Michael stand up , the great prince which

<s> The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea , the son of Beeri , in
the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in
the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel . </s>
<s> The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea . </s>
<s> And the LORD said
to Hosea , Go , take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of
whoredoms : for the land hath committed great whoredom , departing from
the LORD . </s>
<s> So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim ; which
conceived , and bare him a son . </s>
<s> And the LORD said unto him , Call his name Jezreel ; for yet a
little while , and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of
Jehu , and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel . </s>
<s> And it shall come to pass at that day , that I will break the bow
of Israel , in the valley of Jezreel . </s>
<s> And she conceived again , and bare a daughter . </s>
<s> And God said unto
him , Call her name Loruhamah : for I will no more have mercy upon the
house of Israel ; but I will utterly take them away . </s>
<s> But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah , and will save them
by the LORD their God , and will not save them by bow , nor by sword ,
nor by battle , by horses , nor by horsemen . </s>
<s> Now when she had weaned Loruhamah , she conceived , and bare a son . </s>
<s> Then said God , Call his name Loammi : for ye are not my people , and
I will not be your God . </s>
<s> Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of
the sea , which cannot be measured nor numbered ; and it shall come to
pass , that in the place where it was said unto them , Ye are not my
people , there it shall be said unto them , Ye are the sons of the
living God . </s>
<s> Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be
gathered together , and appoint themselves one head , and they shall
come up out of the land : for great shall be the day of Jezreel . </s>
<s> Say ye unto your brethren , Ammi ; and to your sisters , Ruhamah . </s>
<s> Plead with your mother , plead : for she is not my wife , neither am
I her husband : let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her
sight , and her adulteries from between her breasts ; 2 :3 Lest I strip
her naked , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her
as a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and slay her with
thirst . </s>
<s> And I will not have mercy upon her children ; for they be the
children of whoredoms . </s>
<s> For their mother hath played the harlot : she that conceived them
hath done shamefully : for she said , I will go after my lovers , that
give me my bread and my water , my wool and my flax , mine oil and my
drink . </s>
<s> Therefore , behold , I will hedge up thy way with thorns , and make a
wall , that she shall not find her paths . </s>
<s> And she shall follow after her lovers , but she shall not overtake
them ; and she shall seek them , but shall not find them : then shall she
say , I will go and return to my first husband ; for then was it better
with me than now . </s>
<s> For she did not know that I gave her corn , and wine , and oil , and
multiplied her silver and gold , which they prepared for Baal . </s>
<s> Therefore will I return , and take away my corn in the time
thereof , and my wine in the season thereof , and will recover my wool
and my flax given to cover her nakedness . </s>
<s> And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers ,
and none shall deliver her out of mine hand . </s>
<s> I will also cause all her mirth to cease , her feast days , her new
moons , and her sabbaths , and all her solemn feasts . </s>
<s> And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees , whereof she hath
said , These are my rewards that my lovers have given me : and I will
make them a forest , and the beasts of the field shall eat them . </s>
<s> And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim , wherein she burned
incense to them , and she decked herself with her earrings and her
jewels , and she went after her lovers , and forgat me , saith the LORD . </s>
<s> Therefore , behold , I will allure her , and bring her into the
wilderness , and speak comfortably unto her . </s>
<s> And I will give her her vineyards from thence , and the valley of
Achor for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of
her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of
Egypt . </s>
<s> And it shall be at that day , saith the LORD , that thou shalt call
me Ishi ; and shalt call me no more Baali . </s>
<s> For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth , and
they shall no more be remembered by their name . </s>
<s> And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts
of the field and with the fowls of heaven , and with the creeping
things of the ground : and I will break the bow and the sword and the
battle out of the earth , and will make them to lie down safely . </s>
<s> And I will betroth thee unto me for ever ; yea , I will betroth
thee unto me in righteousness , and in judgment , and in lovingkindness ,
and in mercies . </s>
<s> I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness : and thou shalt

<s> And it shall come to pass in that day , I will hear , saith the
LORD , I will hear the heavens , and they shall hear the earth ; And

<s> And I will sow her unto me in the earth ; and I will have mercy
upon her that had not obtained mercy ; and I will say to them which

<s> Then said the LORD unto me , Go yet , love a woman beloved of her

wine . </s>
<s> So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver , and for an

<s> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king ,

<s> Hear the word of the LORD , ye children of Israel : for the LORD

adultery , they break out , and blood toucheth blood . </s>
<s> Therefore shall the land mourn , and every one that dwelleth
therein shall languish , with the beasts of the field , and with the

<s> Therefore shalt thou fall in the day , and the prophet also shall
fall with thee in the night , and I will destroy thy mother . </s>
<s> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge : because thou hast
rejected knowledge , I will also reject thee , that thou shalt be no
priest to me : seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God , I will
also forget thy children . </s>
<s> As they were increased , so they sinned against me : therefore will
I change their glory into shame . </s>
<s> They eat up the sin of my people , and they set their heart on
their iniquity . </s>
<s> And there shall be , like people , like priest : and I will punish
them for their ways , and reward them their doings . </s>
<s> For they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit
whoredom , and shall not increase : because they have left off to take
heed to the LORD . </s>
<s> Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart . </s>
<s> My people ask counsel at their stocks , and their staff declareth
unto them : for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err , and
they have gone a whoring from under their God . </s>
<s> They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains , and burn incense
upon the hills , under oaks and poplars and elms , because the shadow
thereof is good : therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom , and
your spouses shall commit adultery . </s>
<s> I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom , nor
your spouses when they commit adultery : for themselves are separated
with whores , and they sacrifice with harlots : therefore the people
that doth not understand shall fall . </s>
<s> Though thou , Israel , play the harlot , yet let not Judah offend ;
and come not ye unto Gilgal , neither go ye up to Bethaven , nor swear ,
The LORD liveth . </s>
<s> For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer : now the LORD
will feed them as a lamb in a large place . </s>

<s> Their drink is sour : they have committed whoredom continually :
her rulers with shame do love , Give ye . </s>
<s> The wind hath bound her up in her wings , and they shall be
ashamed because of their sacrifices . </s>
<s> Hear ye this , O priests ; and hearken , ye house of Israel ; and give
ye ear , O house of the king ; for judgment is toward you , because ye
have been a snare on Mizpah , and a net spread upon Tabor . </s>
<s> And the revolters are profound to make slaughter , though I have
been a rebuker of them all . </s>
<s> I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hid from me : for now , O Ephraim ,
thou committest whoredom , and Israel is defiled . </s>
<s> They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God : for the
spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them , and they have not known
the LORD . </s>
<s> And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face : therefore shall
Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity : Judah also shall fall with
them . </s>
<s> They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the
LORD ; but they shall not find him ; he hath withdrawn himself from
them . </s>
<s> They have dealt treacherously against the LORD : for they have
begotten strange children : now shall a month devour them with their
portions . </s>
<s> Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah , and the trumpet in Ramah : cry aloud
at Bethaven , after thee , O Benjamin . </s>
<s> Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke : among the tribes
of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be . </s>
<s> The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound :
therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water . </s>
<s> Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment , because he willingly
walked after the commandment . </s>
<s> Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth , and to the house of
Judah as rottenness . </s>
<s> When Ephraim saw his sickness , and Judah saw his wound , then went
Ephraim to the Assyrian , and sent to king Jareb : yet could he not heal
you , nor cure you of your wound . </s>
<s> For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion , and as a young lion to the
house of Judah : I , even I , will tear and go away ; I will take away ,
and none shall rescue him . </s>
<s> I will go and return to my place , till they acknowledge their
offence , and seek my face : in their affliction they will seek me
early . </s>
<s> Come , and let us return unto the LORD : for he hath torn , and he
will heal us ; he hath smitten , and he will bind us up . </s>
<s> After two days will he revive us : in the third day he will raise
us up , and we shall live in his sight . </s>
<s> Then shall we know , if we follow on to know the LORD : his going
forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the
rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth . </s>
<s> O Ephraim , what shall I do unto thee ? </s>
<s> O Judah , what shall I do
unto thee ? </s>
<s> for your goodness is as a morning cloud , and as the early
dew it goeth away . </s>
<s> Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets ; I have slain them by
the words of my mouth : and thy judgments are as the light that goeth
forth . </s>
<s> For I desired mercy , and not sacrifice ; and the knowledge of God
more than burnt offerings . </s>
<s> But they like men have transgressed the covenant : there have they
dealt treacherously against me . </s>
<s> Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity , and is polluted with
blood . </s>
<s> And as troops of robbers wait for a man , so the company of priests
murder in the way by consent : for they commit lewdness . </s>
<s> I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel : there is
the whoredom of Ephraim , Israel is defiled . </s>
<s> Also , O Judah , he hath set an harvest for thee , when I returned
the captivity of my people . </s>
<s> When I would have healed Israel , then the iniquity of Ephraim was
discovered , and the wickedness of Samaria : for they commit falsehood ;
and the thief cometh in , and the troop of robbers spoileth without . </s>
<s> And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their
wickedness : now their own doings have beset them about ; they are
before my face . </s>
<s> They make the king glad with their wickedness , and the princes
with their lies . </s>
<s> They are all adulterers , as an oven heated by the baker , who
ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough , until it be
leavened . </s>
<s> In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles
of wine ; he stretched out his hand with scorners . </s>
<s> For they have made ready their heart like an oven , whiles they lie
in wait : their baker sleepeth all the night ; in the morning it burneth
as a flaming fire . </s>
<s> They are all hot as an oven , and have devoured their judges ; all
their kings are fallen : there is none among them that calleth unto me . </s>
<s> Ephraim , he hath mixed himself among the people ; Ephraim is a cake
not turned . </s>
<s> Strangers have devoured his strength , and he knoweth it not : yea ,
gray hairs are here and there upon him , yet he knoweth not . </s>
<s> And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face : and they do not
return to the LORD their God , nor seek him for all this . </s>
<s> Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart : they call to
Egypt , they go to Assyria . </s>
<s> When they shall go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring
them down as the fowls of the heaven ; I will chastise them , as their
congregation hath heard . </s>
<s> Woe unto them ! </s>
<s> for they have fled from me : destruction unto them ! </s>
<s> they have transgressed against me : though I have redeemed
them , yet they have spoken lies against me . </s>
<s> And they have not cried unto me with their heart , when they
howled upon their beds : they assemble themselves for corn and wine ,
and they rebel against me . </s>
<s> Though I have bound and strengthened their arms , yet do they
imagine mischief against me . </s>
<s> They return , but not to the most High : they are like a deceitful
bow : their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their
tongue : this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt . </s>
<s> Set the trumpet to thy mouth . </s>
<s> He shall come as an eagle against
the house of the LORD , because they have transgressed my covenant , and
trespassed against my law . </s>
<s> Israel shall cry unto me , My God , we know thee . </s>
<s> Israel hath cast off the thing that is good : the enemy shall
pursue him . </s>
<s> They have set up kings , but not by me : they have made princes , and
I knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them
idols , that they may be cut off . </s>
<s> Thy calf , O Samaria , hath cast thee off ; mine anger is kindled
against them : how long will it be ere they attain to innocency ? </s>
<s> 8 :6
For from Israel was it also : the workman made it ; therefore it is not
God : but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces . </s>
<s> For they have sown the wind , and they shall reap the whirlwind : it
hath no stalk ; the bud shall yield no meal : if so be it yield , the
strangers shall swallow it up . </s>
<s> Israel is swallowed up : now shall they be among the Gentiles as a
vessel wherein is no pleasure . </s>
<s> For they are gone up to Assyria , a wild ass alone by himself :
Ephraim hath hired lovers . </s>
<s> Yea , though they have hired among the nations , now will I gather
them , and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of
princes . </s>
<s> Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin , altars shall be
unto him to sin . </s>
<s> I have written to him the great things of my law , but they were
counted as a strange thing . </s>
<s> They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings , and
eat it ; but the LORD accepteth them not ; now will he remember their
iniquity , and visit their sins : they shall return to Egypt . </s>
<s> For Israel hath forgotten his Maker , and buildeth temples ; and
Judah hath multiplied fenced cities : but I will send a fire upon his
cities , and it shall devour the palaces thereof . </s>
<s> Rejoice not , O Israel , for joy , as other people : for thou hast
gone a whoring from thy God , thou hast loved a reward upon every
cornfloor . </s>
<s> The floor and the winepress shall not feed them , and the new wine
shall fail in her . </s>
<s> They shall not dwell in the LORD 's land ; but Ephraim shall return
to Egypt , and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria . </s>
<s> They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD , neither shall
they be pleasing unto him : their sacrifices shall be unto them as the
bread of mourners ; all that eat thereof shall be polluted : for their
bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> What will ye do in the solemn day , and in the day of the feast of
the LORD ? </s>
<s> 9 :6 For , lo , they are gone because of destruction : Egypt
shall gather them up , Memphis shall bury them : the pleasant places for
their silver , nettles shall possess them : thorns shall be in their
tabernacles . </s>
<s> The days of visitation are come , the days of recompence are come ;
Israel shall know it : the prophet is a fool , the spiritual man is mad ,
for the multitude of thine iniquity , and the great hatred . </s>
<s> The watchman of Ephraim was with my God : but the prophet is a
snare of a fowler in all his ways , and hatred in the house of his God . </s>
<s> They have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the days of Gibeah :
therefore he will remember their iniquity , he will visit their sins . </s>
<s> I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness ; I saw your fathers
as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time : but they went to
Baalpeor , and separated themselves unto that shame ; and their
abominations were according as they loved . </s>
<s> As for Ephraim , their glory shall fly away like a bird , from the
birth , and from the womb , and from the conception . </s>
<s> Though they bring up their children , yet will I bereave them ,
that there shall not be a man left : yea , woe also to them when I
depart from them ! </s>
<s>  Ephraim , as I saw Tyrus , is planted in a
pleasant place : but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the
murderer . </s>
<s> Give them , O LORD : what wilt thou give ? </s>
<s> give them a miscarrying

<s> All their wickedness is in Gilgal : for there I hated them : for

<s> Ephraim is smitten , their root is dried up , they shall bear no
fruit : yea , though they bring forth , yet will I slay even the beloved

the LORD ; what then should a king do to us ? </s>
<s>  They have spoken
words , swearing falsely in making a covenant : thus judgment springeth
up as hemlock in the furrows of the field . </s>
<s> The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of
Bethaven : for the people thereof shall mourn over it , and the priests
thereof that rejoiced on it , for the glory thereof , because it is
departed from it . </s>
<s> It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king
Jareb : Ephraim shall receive shame , and Israel shall be ashamed of his
own counsel . </s>
<s> As for Samaria , her king is cut off as the foam upon the water . </s>
<s> The high places also of Aven , the sin of Israel , shall be
destroyed : the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars ;

on us . </s>
<s> O Israel , thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah : there they
stood : the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not
overtake them . </s>
<s> It is in my desire that I should chastise them ; and the people
shall be gathered against them , when they shall bind themselves in
their two furrows . </s>
<s> And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught , and loveth to tread
out the corn ; but I passed over upon her fair neck : I will make
Ephraim to ride ; Judah shall plow , and Jacob shall break his clods . </s>
<s> Sow to yourselves in righteousness , reap in mercy ; break up your
fallow ground : for it is time to seek the LORD , till he come and rain
righteousness upon you . </s>
<s> Ye have plowed wickedness , ye have reaped iniquity ; ye have
eaten the fruit of lies : because thou didst trust in thy way , in the
multitude of thy mighty men . </s>
<s> Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people , and all thy
fortresses shall be spoiled , as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day
of battle : the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children . </s>
<s> So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness : in
a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off . </s>
<s> When Israel was a child , then I loved him , and called my son out
of Egypt . </s>
<s> As they called them , so they went from them : they sacrificed unto
Baalim , and burned incense to graven images . </s>
<s> I taught Ephraim also to go , taking them by their arms ; but they
knew not that I healed them . </s>
<s> I drew them with cords of a man , with bands of love : and I was to
them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws , and I laid meat

LORD . </s>

<s> Therefore turn thou to thy God : keep mercy and judgment and wait

<s> He is a merchant , the balances of deceit are in his hand : he

<s> And Ephraim said , Yet I am become rich , I have found me out
substance : in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that
were sin . </s>
<s> And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet
make thee to dwell in tabernacles , as in the days of the solemn feast . </s>
<s> I have also spoken by the prophets , and I have multiplied
visions , and used similitudes , by the ministry of the prophets . </s>
<s> Is there iniquity in Gilead ? </s>
<s> surely they are vanity : they

furrows of the fields . </s>
<s> And Jacob fled into the country of Syria , and Israel served for
a wife , and for a wife he kept sheep . </s>
<s> And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt , and by a
prophet was he preserved . </s>
<s> Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly : therefore shall he
leave his blood upon him , and his reproach shall his LORD return unto
him . </s>
<s> When Ephraim spake trembling , he exalted himself in Israel ; but
when he offended in Baal , he died . </s>
<s> And now they sin more and more , and have made them molten images
of their silver , and idols according to their own understanding , all

sacrifice kiss the calves . </s>
<s> Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew

<s> According to their pasture , so were they filled ; they were
filled , and their heart was exalted ; therefore have they forgotten me . </s>
<s> Therefore I will be unto them as a lion : as a leopard by the way

of her whelps , and will rend the caul of their heart , and there will I
devour them like a lion : the wild beast shall tear them . </s>
<s> O Israel , thou hast destroyed thyself ; but in me is thine help . </s>

<s> And I took my staff , even Beauty , and cut it asunder , that I
might break my covenant which I had made with all the people . </s>
<s> And it was broken in that day : and so the poor of the flock that
waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD . </s>
<s> And I said unto them , If ye think good , give me my price ; and if
not , forbear . </s>
<s> So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver . </s>
<s> And the LORD said unto me , Cast it unto the potter : a goodly
price that I was prised at of them . </s>
<s> And I took the thirty pieces of
silver , and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD . </s>
<s> Then I cut asunder mine other staff , even Bands , that I might
break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel . </s>
<s> And the LORD said unto me , Take unto thee yet the instruments of
a foolish shepherd . </s>
<s> For , lo , I will raise up a shepherd in the land , which shall not
visit those that be cut off , neither shall seek the young one , nor
heal that that is broken , nor feed that that standeth still : but he
shall eat the flesh of the fat , and tear their claws in pieces . </s>
<s> Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock ! </s>
